Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our
CFO, David Goulden. We had a strong fourth quarter as we booked 191 million room nights, which is up 12%
year-over-year, and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We produced over $3.3 billion in revenue and
approximately $1.3 billion in EBITDA, which are year-over-year increases of approximately 5% and 3% on a
constant-currency basis, respectively. I will talk first about our full-year performance in 2019, then about our
objectives for 2020, and then I will address the current situation regarding the coronavirus.
2019 was a good year for our company. We booked 845 million room nights for the year, which is 11% more than
in 2018. Just to put that into context, that means we booked on average more than 2.3 million room nights each
day. We produced strong year-over-year growth across our key financial metrics. Non-GAAP revenue and
adjusted EBITDA were up 8% and 6% on a constant-currency basis, respectively. Our non-GAAP EPS was up
15% on a constant-currency basis, exceeding our guidance for the year. Our EPS growth rate benefited from over
$8 billion of share repurchases during 2019, which demonstrates our disciplined approach to returning capital to
shareholders and our confidence in our business.
I am pleased with these results considering the macro environment we faced in certain geographies throughout
the year. Moreover, we accomplished this top-line growth rate, while also producing solid leverage in our
performance marketing spend. Our ability to execute consistently in this environment speaks to our scale and
global diversity as well as to the dedicated and talented teams we have at our company.

We made solid progress against our key strategic goals for the year: expanding the Booking.com payment
platform, improving our Alternative Accommodations business, and further building our Connected Trip strategy.
As we move into 2020, we will continue to focus on becoming an even more customer-centric company that
drives loyalty and increased repeat behavior. We plan to accomplish this goal through smart customer acquisition,
while providing the best experience in our core accommodations product using our scale to offer the best value to
our customers and making further progress in our Connected Trip strategy.
In addition, while we have always been a cost-conscious organization, in 2020, we will further emphasize the
need to make sure our expenses are appropriate for our revenue, and we'll look at ways to streamline and make
all aspects of our company more efficient. Investing in products and processes is important for the long-term, but
so too is eliminating unnecessary expense, and during 2020, we'll be taking a close look at these opportunities.
One of our highlights during 2019 was expanding our payment capabilities at Booking.com. Over 50% of our
Booking.com's gross bookings now occur on properties that are enabled on its payment platform. The percentage
of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on its payment platform grew from approximately 10% in 2018 to
over 15% in 2019, and we expect this to reach approximately 25% in 2020.
As we've discussed, this platform provides payment options favored by both our customers and property partners,
particularly non-hotel property partners, and provide a platform for merchant product offerings. Merchant offerings
also provide Booking.com with merchandising capabilities, and we expect to continue to increase our investment
in this capability to drive growth. This payment platform is foundational for our Connected Trip strategy in which
we envision a frictionless customer experience across multiple products that we believe will drive increased
loyalty.
Our Alternative Accommodations business grew solidly in 2019 and has large scale. As of December 31, 2019,
we had 6.3 million listings in our Alternative Accommodations business. We remain focused on increasing the
quality and variety of properties joining our platform, so we can provide the best choices for our customers and
drive search conversion. Booking.com's Alternative Accommodations business recorded approximately $3.1
billion in revenue in 2019, representing approximately 21% of our overall revenue for the year, and a solid growth
rate of 14% when expressed in euros. It consistently grew faster than our core accommodations business
throughout the year and also maintained a healthy profit margin. We believe presenting both Alternative
Accommodations and traditional properties on one platform is the best customer proposition.
Last year, we took further steps to create our vision of a Connected Trip. We're on a journey to build a
multiproduct offering including accommodations, flight, Attractions, ground transport, and dining, all connected by
a seamless payment network and supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless customer
experience that we believe will drive enhanced loyalty and support growth.
We saw early signs of these benefits last year as we leveraged the integration of Rentalcars.com and
Booking.com to deliver a better ground transport offering for Booking.com's customers. Rental car days grew 12%
year-over-year in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the increased cross-sell of the product to Booking.com
customers. We believe we are in the early stages of seeing the benefit from this cross-sell opportunity. We've also
been encouraged by certain incentive programs that provide discounted ground transport options to bookers with
higher-value accommodations. These programs have shown an increase in conversion at acceptable ROIs. We
look forward to further experimentation with these types of offerings during 2020.
We also expanded our flight capabilities across the company in 2019. Booking.com launched an integrated flight
product, while Agoda and Priceline began building a global flight platform that is initially focused on the APAC

region. Currently, Booking.com offers a flight product in 12 countries in Europe, but we plan to expand this
throughout 2020. Booking.com's goal for the year is to be able to expose 50% of its total customers to a flight
product globally. Developing a robust flight product remains an important investment, considering there are more
than 4 billion global flight passengers last year.
Having the ability to engage with these customers early in their travel journey gives us a better opportunity to
cross-sell our accommodation and other products, but even more important, it enables us to offer a true
Connected Trip experience. This year, we will continue to expand other aspects of the Connected Trip such as
Attractions and dining options. For these offerings, we will utilize not only our own assets, but also partner with
third-party providers, so we can offer the best customer experience possible. We continue to see loyalty benefits
from accommodation customers who also use our Attractions product.
We will continue to invest in our app platform as it becomes the center of our Connected Trip experience.
Booking.com remains one of the most downloaded travel apps in the iOS and Android stores globally. According
to a leading third-party research firm, Booking.com was the only OTA to rank in their Top 10 Travel Apps in the
World, ex-China, in 2019, coming in at number three. We've been investing in the app platform for some time as it
is becoming the preferred platform for travel bookings, and we are very pleased with the strong room night growth
that occurs on Booking.com's app.
As I mentioned earlier, all of these investments are designed to drive greater loyalty and increase repeat behavior
with our customers. We made progress on this front last year. In each quarter of 2019, our direct channel grew
faster than our primary pay channels and our direct channel increased its share for the year. The direct channel
represents over 50% of our total booked room nights, and when including rooms booked through branded search
terms, this number increases to over 60%.
We have a large and loyal customer base today, but we believe we can grow this further and increase market
share. Booking.com's best and most loyal customers are part of its Genius program. This group of customers has
grown consistently for several years. In 2019, we had over 70 million active Genius customers, an increase of 9%
year-over-year. These Genius customers were responsible for a growing proportion of Booking.com's booked
room nights in 2019, and we thank them for their loyalty. On top of that, we see that Genius customers book more
frequently and more often on a direct basis when compared to non-Genius customers. We will continue to focus
our efforts on growing this special group of customers and offering them great value as part of their Genius
membership.
While we are pleased about our long-term prospects, we recognize that current travel demand has been impacted
by the coronavirus. At the present time, Greater China has been affected the most. The broader APAC region has
also been impacted, which is an area in which we have been experiencing strong growth over the last several
years, and we are now starting to see a slowdown in travel globally and are aware of the potential for further
demand deceleration around the world.
David will provide more details in his remarks, but I would like to point out this is not the first time our company
management team has faced an exogenous impact to travel demand. We know that travel is fundamental to
people's lives, and we believe travel industry growth will rebound to prior growth rates. While the coronavirus
impacts travel, we will continue to manage the company in a measured way that builds value for the long-term.
However, the steps we are taking today include: one, making sure we take care of our customers and help them
with their travel plans, which includes facilitating cancellations and working closely with our supply partners; two,
ensuring the health and safety of our over 26,000 employees around the world; three, managing our marketing

efforts appropriately, we will continue to participate in those paid channels that provide us quality traffic at
attractive ROIs recognizing that we need to incorporate higher cancellation rates in our bidding calculations; in
regards to brand marketing, we will be very cognizant of when and where brand marketing money should be
spent this year; four, working with our travel suppliers so they are best-positioned to achieve success on our
platform; and five, continuing to invest for the future. The company that provides a better travel service, a holistic,
seamless, frictionless, Connected Trip that delivers more value to both a traveler and our supply partners, will
create a lasting relationship with both travelers and suppliers, and we intend to create this service over time.
With that, I will now turn the call over to David for the financial review.

David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the fourth quarter and 2019, and then
discuss our thoughts on 2020 and our guidance for the first quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior year
comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our
earnings release.
Now, on to our results for the quarter. Our booked room night growth of 12% in Q4 exceeded the high end of our
guidance range as growth accelerated through the quarter with a strong finish in December. Our room night
growth in Europe continued to exceed our expectations in Q4 despite a macro environment that remained
cautious. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world also exceeded our expectations and grew slightly
faster than Europe in Q4. Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 4% year-on-year
in Q4 on a constant-currency basis, which was in line with our guidance.
As indicated on our last earnings call, the year-over-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within
several key markets such as the US, Japan and Hong Kong, as well as an increasing mix to faster-growing lower
ADR markets and the impact of lapping 1% ADR growth in Q4 of last year. Changes in foreign exchange rates
reduced Q4 growth rates in US dollars by approximately 1 percentage point versus last year. We estimate the
change in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue, and EBITDA growth in Q4 by similar amounts and EPS
growth by less than 1 percentage point.
Q4 gross bookings grew by 6% expressed in US dollars and grew about 7% on a constant-currency basis,
coming in above the high end of our guidance range. Consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion
and grew by 4% in US dollars and about 5% on a constant-currency basis. Advertising and other revenue, which
is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 3% in Q4 as we lapped the benefit of the
HotelsCombined acquisition in December. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $1.3 billion, which exceeded the high end
of our guidance range and was up 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and about 3% on a constant-currency
basis.
Performance marketing expense increased 2% year-on-year, which helped drive leverage of about 40 basis
points in the quarter. The year-on-year growth was driven by higher-than-expected volumes in our paid channels.
We spent $86 million on brand marketing in the quarter, which represented a decline of 31% versus Q4 last year,
and computed about 130 basis points of leverage. This decrease is in part driven by a ramp-up in spend in the
second half of 2018. We remain committed to investing in brand marketing in a disciplined manner going forward.
Sales and other expense decreased 1% versus Q4 last year and contributed about 30 basis points of leverage
due to reduced chargeback expenses as well as a reclassification of certain sales and other expenses incurred

during 2019 into contra-revenue in Q4, both of which offset the increase in expenses related to the continued
growth of our payments platform of Booking.com.
Personnel expense was in line with our forecast, growing 16% year-on-year and contributing about 175 basis
points of deleverage in the quarter, as expected, driven in part by lower year-end reversal of bonus accruals than
we experienced in Q4 2018.
G&A expenses increased 16% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes a $21 million travel
transaction tax charge in Q4 of 2018. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 60 basis points of deleverage
in the quarter. This year-over-year increase in G&A was driven largely by higher indirect taxes including the
French DST. Finally, information technology expenses increased 42% year-over-year driven by several items
supporting the growth of the business including payments to contractors, software license fees, outsourced data
center and cloud costs.
Our non-GAAP EPS was $23.30, up 4% on a reported and constant-currency basis versus the prior year. NonGAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.7% in Q4, which is significantly higher than Q4 last year due
to a one-time adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018 related to a provision of the Tax Act that was
clarified by revenue guidance issued in Q4 2018. Our Q4 tax rate was about 1 percentage point lower than our
guidance due to some discrete items. Our 9% lower share count in Q4 benefited EPS growth in the quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating income increased by 3% and GAAP operating margin decreased by about 50 basis
points compared to Q4 last year. Q4 GAAP net income amounted to $1.2 billion or $27.75 per share, up 81%
from Q4 2018. Our Q4 GAAP net income includes $326 million of pre-tax unrealized gains on our equity
investments in Meituan and Ctrip and $47 million of FX re-measurement losses on our euro bonds. We excluded
these unrealized losses and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results.
We had a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the quarter, which increased significantly from the prior year due to the tax
impacts of the items excluded from non-GAAP results as well as the factors I mentioned that impacted the nonGAAP tax rate. In Q4, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, which declined 1% compared to Q4 last
year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was about $1 billion, which decreased by 1% compared to last year,
mainly due to timing of the payments, which reduced year growth by 15 percentage points.
We repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q4, bringing the total repurchase to the year to over $8 billion. As of
the end of the year, we had about $11.5 billion remaining under our $15 billion repurchase authorization. We
ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and investments, and $8.7 billion of outstanding debt. Looking back at
2019, we're quite pleased with our performance during the year. As we produced steady room night growth in the
10% to 12% range, we delivered a very healthy 39% EBITDA margin, while investing in the business and
absorbing unplanned DST expenses, and we grew our non-GAAP EPS by 11%, or around 15% on a constantcurrency basis, which exceeded our annual guidance of low-double digit growth.
Turning to 2020, our initial outlook reflected a continuation of this operating model, i.e., to gain share in
accommodations with some deceleration in room night growth, to invest in payments, merchandising, and the
Connected Trip for any modest pressure on operating margins, and for EPS growth to benefit from our share
repurchases. Due to a few mechanical factors including the lapping of ADR declines and the phasing of personnel
and G&A expenses during the year, we expect that our earnings growth to be weighted largely to the second half
of the year.

Now, turning to more recent events, the coronavirus has had an impact across our business since it made news
headlines on January 21. The early impacts were [ph] in areas in (21:37) China, but we also saw these impacts
across Asia and to a lesser extent in other regions outside of Asia as well. To help with context, the APAC region
represents a little over 20% of our room nights, with no single country accounting for more than a mid-single digit
share of total room nights. In APAC, we've seen an increase in cancellations, reduction in new bookings, and
pressure on ADRs.
As you all know, it's not possible to predict where and to what degree outbreaks of the coronavirus will disrupt
travel patterns. While the incidents of infections have slowed in China, in the last week alone, new outbreaks have
occurred in South Korea, Iran and Italy. We've been able to measure the impacts on our business so far in Asia,
and we've seen a recent impact of room night bookings in Europe, following the outbreak in Italy. As a result,
we're providing only a near-term outlook with a wider guidance range to account for the possibility there will be a
growing travel disruption in Europe.
Based on where we are in the quarter and considering the continued impact of the coronavirus, we're forecasting
Q1 booked room nights to be down 5% to 10% versus the prior year. Clearly, we're dealing with a very fluid
situation and it's extremely difficult to predict where Q1 will come out, but this is our best estimate based upon the
data we have available now. We forecast total gross bookings to decline 8% to 13% on a constant-currency basis
and about 200 basis points more in US dollars. Our Q1 forecast assumes that constant-currency ADRs for the
company will be down about 4%.
We forecast Q1 non-GAAP revenue to decline 3% to 7% on a constant-currency basis and decline 200 basis
points more in US dollars. Q1 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $560 million and $590 million,
which is down 16% to 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis and about 200 basis points more in US
dollars. We're forecasting Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $9.05 to $9.65, which is 14% to 19% below Q1
2019. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate Q1 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year-on-year by approximately
12% to 17%.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q1 includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 18.5%. Our Q1 nonGAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of about 41.6 million shares, which is 9% below Q1 of
last year. We forecast GAAP EPS to be between $7.95 and $8.55 for Q1. Our GAAP EPS guidance for Q1
assumes a tax rate of approximately 18.5%. We use a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.10 when setting our Q1
guidance. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA and net income from
any further fluctuation in currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but the hedges do
not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations.
Finally, a housekeeping item. Starting with our Q1 results and going forward, we plan on reporting our
performance and brand marketing expenses on a combined basis as we view our overall marketing spend as
investment in customer acquisition and retention.
We'll now take your questions. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Presenters, our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lloyd Walmsley
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Thanks. I guess just the first question, a bit of a clarification. I think, David, you said something about expecting
some share gain with deceleration in room nights. I wasn't sure if I heard that correctly, is that kind of before the
impact of the virus or including the impact of the virus? Anything you can kind of share there? And along the same
lines, ex the virus, are you seeing anything in particular changing with marketing ROIs as some competitors pull
back in certain brands and certain geographies? And then I guess a second question, if I can, would just be
anything particular changing with regard to some of the SEO channel impacts from last quarter. Are you seeing
that spread to either new geographies or change in intensity? Anything you could share there would be great.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Sure, Lloyd. Yeah. Thank you. Let me start off answering the first question. So, yes, to clarify, what I said was
when we turn to 2020, we talked about our initial outlook, which is our outlook at the start of the year obviously
around the times we're putting our plans together for the year. We talked about that reflected continuation of the
same operating model we delivered in 2019, so my comments about gaining share in accommodations with some
deceleration of room nights, some modest pressure on operating margins, and for EPS to benefit from our share
buybacks was to give you a flavor of the shape of our profile for the year coming into the year before the
coronavirus.
Yeah, and then on the SEO challenges, to pick up your second, I just want to kind of remind people that as we
said, the SEO channel is a relatively small part of our business, and it has been for a period of time. The SEO
channel continues to be under pressure as the primary provider of that channel focuses more upon their paid
search rather than free search, but we continue to do well in that channel. We have teams dedicated to it. We are
pleased with our share in that channel. As a channel, it is under continued pressure, but as we said before, really
contributes a very minor part of our overall business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lloyd Walmsley
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Okay. And then anything on just marketing ROIs outside of the impact of the virus given competitive dynamics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, let me start, and then maybe Glenn can add. Again, I'll talk about Q4 because obviously, Q4 was a very
clean quarter relative to not having a virus and it's only a few weeks behind us, so I think it's a good time to still
talk about Q4. We were pleased with our ROIs in the channels in Q4. We didn't see any major shifts.
We mentioned we saw a continued leverage in our performance marketing spend because our performance
marketing channels continued to grow less rapidly than the overall business so the leverage that we

demonstrated was kind of a mix-driven leverage, a mathematical leverage. ROIs didn't really change very much in
Q4, nothing to really note. We're pleased with where they were, and I think – does this answers all of your
question, or were you also asking about current quarter as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lloyd Walmsley
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
That's great. I'll assume that the virus is making things pretty messy, but – unless you want to add something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
No, I just wanted to stop there. I think that's the right place to stop.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lloyd Walmsley
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We do have another question from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark S. F. Mahaney
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Thanks. I want to ask about two things. Just kind of attach rate with the Connected Trip and how far along do you
think you are in tapping into that opportunity? I noticed that both rental car days and airline ticket growth, unit
growth rates nicely accelerated in the December quarter. It looks like that's much easier comp in airline tickets,
but you called out some kind of greater cross-selling opportunities you're getting with rental cars, so just talk about
where you are in the process of doing that, is it a small percentage that you've even attempted this at so we can
get a sense of how much better the results could be in rental cars?
And then, Glenn, when you were talking about the outlook, you seemed to emphasize a little bit more streamlining
costs in 2020. I don't think that was related to coronavirus. I think it's – or maybe it was, but I don't think it was. It
sounded like you want to be a little bit more careful about costs or something like that. Could you just explain the
why behind that, why get a little bit more focused on streamlining costs this year versus last year, unless it was all
coronavirus, but I didn't get that impression. Thanks, Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Hi, Mark. Yeah, let me take the first one, the attach rates, et cetera. And I think you called it out correctly. The
rental car business has shown some good numbers. If you look in the supplemental statistics at the end of our
press release and you can see some nice growth there, and part of that growth is coming from that cross-sell part
of our Connected Trip that we're building out, and you're also correct in your statement about the air business. Air
business is so early we're just really are getting that up and running. That's why you're not really seeing any of the
increase there from that, or not enough to matter right now. It's very, very low attach rates. When I look at those
numbers, I believe over time, we should increase those significantly, and it's going to take some time as we
continue to optimize, figure out what's the best way to present it, where to show it.
One of the things I'm very proud about is the center we've built in Tel Aviv that is filled with a bunch of machine
learning experts, AI geniuses who really look at all of the different parts of the way we present things, and they're

trying to come up with what is the best way to present an offer to a traveler at the right time and putting in what is
the right merchandising benefit that we should do it to get the right conversion and the right bottom-line. It's
something that the more data we get, the better we'll know what the right thing to do, but it's something that's
going to take time. So, that's the answer to that one.
Regarding costs, you're also absolutely correct on that. One of the things when I took the job over in Amsterdam
as CEO of Booking.com, and I've been there now a little more than six months, is looking at what are we
spending on, where are we spending, what projects are we on, which ones are the right ones, which ones should
we not be doing right now, and then taking that throughout our entire organization. Always believe that you should
be a cost-effective company, and I believe it's also very natural, as companies grow very rapidly and achieve
great success on the bottom-line, sometimes discipline lightens up a little bit. So certainly before the coronavirus,
I was already thinking that we need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to spend the money
correctly.
One of the things I've mentioned in the calls over the last couple of quarters is us bringing all of our companies
together better, and one of the benefits of that is to get some efficiencies in our spend, a real cost procurementtype project. And in the past, we've run all these companies independently, and that was the right thing to do at
the time, but while doing that, you do lose out on some cost efficiencies. Now, the state of the company where it's
at, now it's time to start bringing that in, and that's what we're going to be doing.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Kopelman
Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC Q
Great. Thanks a lot. Could you give us more color on the latest trends in Europe travel bookings that you've seen
over the last few days following the outbreak of the coronavirus in Italy? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, Kevin, this is David. Let me take that. Let me just kind of maybe frame it in the way that the quarter shapes
up and our projections do take into account what we've seen in the last few days. So, let me kind of give you a lay
of the land first of all by region. Not surprisingly, we already mentioned that China is the worst impacted. Asia,
excluding China, has also been impacted for some time. The rest of world, which obviously includes Europe and
Europe is a big piece of that for us, was growing through February, but we also expected to be impacted to the
negative in March as well.
To give you a bit more color in terms of just how it plays across the quarter, on a consolidated basis, we saw – we
[ph] crossed (34:15) all room night growth in January even though we saw some tapering off at the end with the
virus hitting the news on the 21st. Expect February to be approximately flat from a growth rate point of view, and
therefore to get to our guidance for the quarter, expect to see declines in March.

days?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yes. I mean, we really obviously as I mentioned, we're dealing with a very fluid situation, very difficult to predict
what's going on, because we're responding to something that we have no control over. We've given you kind of
our best view of it, so when we built what we expect to happen in March and created the guidance range, we're
looking very specifically at what has happened over the last few days after the outbreak in Italy, and the response
we've seen in Europe in response to that, which is not surprising, has been negative. So, yes, we are expecting
and we're seeing even though we're going to get room night growth through rest of world in February towards the
end of February that is already in decline and we expect it to continue to decline into March.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Justin Post
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Great. Thank you, a couple questions. I guess it would be helpful if you could give us a view on past behavior
when you've had travel disruptions and people cancel their trips or your most loyal customers don't book. How
long does it take before they start going on trips again, or do you see a timeframe where people cancel and then
rebook? I know you can't be too specific, but any thoughts on that?
And then second, it's interesting your main competitor pulling back spending. You're talking about some cost
savings. Do you think there's inefficiencies in marketing or other channels in travel and maybe the industry as a
whole could benefit as people take a deeper look at their costs? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Hi, Justin. I think it would not be wise to draw and use past experience as an analogy for what will happen in the
future. The situation now is very different. Say, I've now been in this business, in fact this week, it'll be 20 years
I've been at this company. My anniversary is Friday, 20 years, and so I've seen a lot of exogenous factors I
mentioned, impacting travel, some extremely severe, and I won't go through all of them because we'll use up the
entire time for the call.
That being said, they all have different effects and different rebound time periods. So, it's not going to be helpful
for me to tell you what took after 9/11 or after the GFC, or after swine flu or after the volcano in Iceland. I mean, I
could go on and on and on, which I'll stop there. So, I really can't be that helpful and you'll just have to make your
own best guesstimates, which will be as good as anybody else's guesstimates.
Regarding spending, we have very high margins compared to anybody else in the industry, but that does not give
us a license to waste money, and I want to continue to always be looking, are we spending correctly in every
single part of this company, so we can then spend the money in the right place at the right time.

In terms of marketing, there probably is a lot of waste in the industry, probably and I think we can see that. Some
people who are probably going to be pulling back in certain of their marketing. We like to think that we've been
efficient and effective, but I think there's always room everywhere to do better, and we're going to continue to do
so. That's the only right way to try and have a long-term successful company. I am confident though that
regardless of what the – towards your first question, I am confident the business will be coming back. It's
something that we've seen over and over and over again. As I said many, many times here, travel is a basic need
for people. They have been doing it for a very, very long time, and as soon as the air clears, so to speak, you'll
see people will be coming back to travel.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Nowak
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, please. David, just I appreciate the month-over-month
commentary for the first quarter, but maybe just so we can all sort of better understand the underlying durability of
growth, how big of a room night and EBITDA headwind have you put into the guide to factor in corona for the first
quarter? And then the second one, Glenn, just to sort of talk about opportunities and sort of untapped
geographies. Talk to us about how you think about the importance and the opportunity to focus more on the US
from a branding and a performance marketing perspective this year to perhaps take more share in that area.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first part of it. I'm going to try to avoid getting into specific growth rates by
month. I'll give you a flavor. I think you can do some back-of-the-envelope math to kind of figure out what March
has to look like in terms of getting to a minus 5% to minus 10% range. The way that we've looked at this is that we
have, as I mentioned in my answer to Kevin, kind of looked at very much so what's happened to the last few days
and anticipating at the lower end of the range that the travel environment in Europe may get worse because we
would be surprised if there's only one outbreak in Europe over the course of the rest of the quarter.
So, we've taken into account what we saw happening over the last week, which of course is led by a lot of
cancellations, so over time, it may not be quite as bad as we're seeing in the last week because you see
obviously the different growth rate on underlying bookings, vis-à-vis cancellations, the early reactions to these
news patterns because usually you get spike in cancellations and things can moderate out.
But we've taken into account what we've seen happening over the course of the last week. We projected that for
the rest of the quarter, and recognize that in fact it may get worse if there are additional outbreaks in Europe or
further slowdowns in the rest of the world. So, that's how we've tried to intelligently give you some guidance data
points from obviously data that we're getting is moving very rapidly but it is the best data that we have as of until
this morning.

In regards to our opportunities around the world, the US is without doubt our biggest opportunity. It is an
enormous market that we under-index significantly. Now, the reason for why we have not achieved what we'd like
to yet and historical as you know, Booking.com was always a hotel-only company, and we didn't have an air
product there for example. Many Americans like to start their travel business using air, so now, we're going to be
bringing out an air product over time, so that will be one.
Second thing is, extremely price competitive, price-sensitive consumer in the US. Booking.com historically an
agency player, meaning the price was set by the hotels, or by the non-hotel accommodations. We believe that we
have to be able to merchandise, meaning adjusting what that value to the consumer is going to be. But to do that,
you've got to have a payment product. It was only last quarter that we got up running the domestic payment
product for our US consumers. That's another one.
Another big issue, packages. Many Americans like to use a package product, or like to do some sort of
combination that will get them more value. Well, we're just starting that now and one of the things I'm very proud
about is working between priceline.com and Booking.com to come up with a package product for the US
consumers that we're just getting that out.
The other thing is we have other assets to help bring consumers to our sites and make them aware of the great
things we have. One of them for example, OpenTable. A lot of people are using OpenTable every month. In the
past, we have never done anything to really bring together the power of the OpenTable platform and the
Booking.com platform in a way that will provide more value to the consumers. So, lots of things that we're working
on because I do believe the US is a great opportunity for us to help build out our business.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Justin Patterson
Analyst, Raymond James Financial Inc. Q
Great. Thanks so much. One on Connected Trip first, how should we think about scaling supply through your own
assets and third-party partners on the attractions and dining side? With partners in there, is there anything you
need to control to ensure an optimal customer experience? And then the second question's on marketing, as your
direct channel mix grows and your payments business grows, how do you think about that incremental ROI of
using coupons to drive conversion versus say attracting customers via branded performance marketing? Thanks
so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
I wanted to take the first one, and I'll let David, being our CFO, he can talk about how we're going to optimize in
terms of the coupons. You're right in terms that in an ideal world, you would like to have all of your supply directly
connect to us and you prefer in an ideal world not to be using third-party suppliers. That being said, that's a
balance against speed to market and making sure you have the supply necessary to create a good offer to the
consumers. So, in the interest of speed, we have gone with third-party providers to provide inventory that we don't
have.

I mentioned OpenTable a little while ago. Well, OpenTable has a great product and they do a lot of business in a
lot of different cities, but there are also a lot of cities around the world that they don't do business, and we want to
provide that dining opportunity to our consumers in as many cities as we can. So, we will partner with others.
Attractions, the same thing. We had our own contracts with the supply, but there are a lot of places in the world
where people are traveling, so to make sure that we have the supply, we're going to third parties. Over time, we
believe that in the long run, having your own supply helps you in terms of creating that truly seamless Connected
Trip, but speed matters in this market, so we're going to do that too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, and Justin, on the different marketing channels, first of all, we're very pleased to build our direct business.
That's very important for the future in the Connected Trip and the app and all things kind of driving that direction,
but the performance marketing channels are also really important sources of acquisition of new customers for us
and sometimes some existing customers can come back to that net as well. But to answer your question, we look
at all of these on a very measured incremental ROI basis. We can really measure our different activities and
compare them on a very comparable basis, so when it comes to things like coupons or other attractions, we may
only offer through one of our channels, we just look at the ROI on that vis-à-vis other channels and decide where
we lean in or don't as the case may be.
So, we have pretty good metrics on all things like that because we are able to measure the short-term return on
those investments. Again, longer-term, we're looking to drive people towards the direct channel particularly
towards the app, and Glenn mentioned how well downloaded that is and how it's becoming very much a powerful
app in the travel space. And as the Connected Trip becomes a bigger piece of the business and the app becomes
a way to experience the Connected Trip in during the trip, it's either more strategic, but tactically, we can look at
all these different things including things like couponing on a very measured basis and decide to lean in based
upon which ones give us both the short-term returns and also create the highest level of repeat or return to direct
activity after that initial offer.

Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, last year, you talked about achieving double-digits earnings growth
and then exceeded it pretty nicely [indiscernible] (47:12). Understand that situation is a little bit more fluid right
now, and the color you provided on the operating model was helpful. How should we think about those things kind
of translate into earnings growth for this year? And then how are you thinking about using the balance sheet for
share repurchases in the near-term when there is like a disruption currently going on? Thank you.

Sure, Deepak. Thanks for the question. Let me take the first part of it. So, yes, we talked about our operating
model expectations pre-coronavirus as a continuation of the model I think was quite successful for us in 2019,
and I don't want to get to specific targets for 2020 because there's not a lot of point in putting out a hypothetical

forecast for the year, which we could never measure against and bridge against because obviously the year is
going to come out very different from what we expected it only a few weeks ago. But we were pleased with the
way that 2019 came out. If you kind of look back at Q4, look at 2019, understand the underlying health of the
business, and we believe that there's no reason why that model can't continue in normal times. And then, Glenn,
do you want to talk about the second part, balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah. So, we are very pleased to have a very strong balance sheet. Significant amount of free cash. We have a
very good credit rating, and the question really is, as we've always had, is how should we best use our capital?
One of the things has always been share repurchases. Another thing that we always do is we're always looking at
other companies that could potentially help add to our Connected Trip strategic vision, and we're going to
continue to look at that. Certainly, valuations have changed significantly in the recent past and that may provide
an opportunity for us in both areas. But, as David says, it's a very fluid situation right now and we're not going to
box ourselves into anything right this second. I will say though, however, we do look at this very, very carefully
because we do want to be agile.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric J. Sheridan
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, if I can, a few around cost structure and how you're thinking about
investing in the business in sort of a relatively uncertain environment. Is there a way to tease out what are some
of the investments you plan on making, just because they fit with the strategic vision that are going to be made for
the long-term, irrespective of how the environment arcs up or down over the next sort of couple of quarters, and
how much of it is more variable in nature where you might tune up or down investments we could better
understand the variable, they'll probably more likely track with how room nights either get better or worse from the
excellent results in Q4 versus the cautionary results or guide for Q1. Thanks so much, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Sure. So I've been talking about our long-term strategic vision for some time now since I became CEO of the
Holding Company a little more than three years ago, and how important it is to create and continue to create
value for all sides of this marketplace, and we're going to continue to do that and that requires investing in people,
in terms of code, making sure we are providing something that is a differentiator from is out there right now, and
there is no reason to slow that down, stop that, or hold back on that.
The sooner we get out the truly superior travel service, the better we will be, and I want to be in that position when
we come out of this current environment, which is something that is unexpected, but will end. I want to come out
of that as soon as possible with the best services that we have, so we're going to continue on that. We are not
changing that at all.

Now in terms of investments, in terms of marketing and things like that, naturally you always want to make
adjustments based on what the environment is so far, as I mentioned, about brand marketing. Well, we are not
going to be making brand marketing to people who are not listening to that message at all. If you're not thinking
about travel, you're not listening to a travel ad, it's foolish for us to invest money in a brand marketing campaign,
and that's an example of extreme on the other side.
And in between – there are always different things in between that we're going to be making adjustments as we
go throughout the year and we've always been doing that. That's no different.
Do you have anything to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, Eric, I'd just maybe put a little bit of a framework around what Glenn talked about. So if you think of
operating expenses and just kind of look at 2019 for a second, it's about $9.5 billion. A little over half of our OpEx
is really variable with volume. Obviously, our performance marketing change with volume up and down, our brand
marketing is really not volume-related but obviously as Glenn just said, no point spending a lot on branding if
people are not primarily thinking about travel.
And a large piece of our sales and other expenses is also relates to volume as well because that ties back to the
merchant processing costs on our payment platform. So a little over half of our OpEx really is directly tied to the
volume within the business.
Now obviously there are volume-related aspects in the other areas which are mainly in our personnel, G&A, IT, et
cetera, and obviously, there's some fixed and some variable expenses there. But if you think about our cost
structure, it really is quite variable with the large expense items being tied to volume quite directly. And of course
in the areas that are not tied directly, there are things we can continue to do to refine and optimize, as Glenn
talked about.

payments processed through your own payment platform going to 25%. What are the levers that you control to
kind of get that from 15% in 2019 to 25% this year?

Grab partnership, how that might be working for you?

Well, so let me start off with the payments platform. Actually, Glenn was the one who gave the numbers out, but
let me just kind of talk to you about how we see it's developing and the impact it'll have on our income statement.
So as you see, we basically had a growth from 10% in 2018, 15% in 2019, 25% in 2020 we expect obviously to
exit 2020 with the higher than 25% payments, that's the average for the year. Might be helpful just to understand
a little bit about what that's doing to our income statement because there's always been questions about that in
prior calls.
In 2020, we expect payments actually to contribute to both revenue growth as it has been, but also to start
contributing to EBITDA growth as well, with very little impact at all upon our EBITDA rate in 2020 will contribute
towards EBITDA growth as we recover an ever-increasing percentage of our payment costs. So that's how I think
about payments rolling through our business.
Obviously, there's still a very attractive nature in our agency model as well, so one is not going to completely
replace the other, but as Glenn said, for all sorts of reasons including the ability to participate in merchandising
and also to be able to package and control things together via the Connected Trip, our payments will be become
an ever-increasing part of business, and we're pleased with how it is progressing and we're on track to get it to a
stage where it starts to contribute towards EBITDA growth which we'll start doing this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
And regarding the Grab relationship, I'm very pleased about how that's been progressing, and some people will
remember we invested in Grab for three reasons. One reason was Grab has a significant number of customers
and we want to find all different ways that we can get exposed our hotel accommodation, all of our travel services,
to customers in different ways, and that certainly was a great way to do it. One.
The other thing is that our travelers when they arrive in a place that they're not familiar with, they want to know
how are we going to get around? And many people sometimes mistakenly assume that whatever ride sharing
capability they have in their home country is going to be in the place they go visit and it's not going to be there,
and they are not going to know what they're going to do. And then they figure out what am I going to do, and one
of the great things is we said that we would come up with Grab in a way that a person can use the Booking.com
app in a seamless way can get a ride sharing without having to download another app, without having to put a
credit card into something that they're not familiar with, and it will be seamless and a great experience. And I
mentioned last quarter how we've gotten that up and running in Singapore. And the third thing of course is that
we'd like to have a financial return on the money we invested.
One of the things I mentioned in the last quarter was how by the end of the year I expected us to be able to have
that Grab app operational in the Booking.com app by the end of the year for Indonesia and Thailand, and I'm very
pleased that we are now actually operational in every single territory that Grab operates on the iOS platform. So
it's just a great shout-out to the team who has been working on that, and thank you, guys, for getting that done
ahead of schedule and really pushing that through.
We'll be operational for Android I think in two to four weeks I've been told, and we're talking about it's now beyond
Singapore, it's Malaysia, it's Indonesia, it's Thailand, it's Vietnam, it's Cambodia, it's Philippines, it's Myanmar,
everywhere the Grab is, and I tell you, I've seen this used and it really is something that makes it so easy. You get
off that plane in that airport and you just go to that Booking.com app and right away, you can get that car to take
you to a hotel. It's a wonderful experience, and we're also on the other side being able to show our hotel
accommodations to more and more Grab customers. So good in all areas.

Okay. Thanks very much. So Glenn, I guess out of adversity can come opportunity, so in an environment in which
folks are going to be really starved for business, are there any silver linings we should be thinking about in terms
of Booking becoming a more important partner for your suppliers or being able to onboard more supply for the
future?
And I guess for the integrated travel experience as well as the rollout of your own payment rails, you are talking
about transforming what the Booking.com experience has meant for the consumer for some time now. So do you
feel like you have to retrain them to look for non-hotel products or pay upfront, and do you think you need to incur
some cost to bring up that awareness? Thank you.

So nobody wants their business to succeed because of unfortunate events. Nobody hopes for that. But
sometimes the events happen anyway and you do end up being a beneficiary of those events. Companies that
are stronger when they enter into a bad period emerge even stronger, and in this industry, I've seen it happen
over and over again.
No doubt I've talked in the past about potential recessions and what would happen in a recession, and why I
believe that would make us more valuable to suppliers, so that they would use us more to get demand because
they needed it more, and you have pointed out what could be a very unfortunate thing for many players in our
industry.
So yes, silver lining is one way to describe it. I do believe that in the long run we will emerge from this in a much
better position, a stronger competitor, and we will end up even better off, though of course, no one would ever
hope for that to happen under that way.
In regards to the consumer, consumers are amazing how they – they learn very rapidly how to save money, get
value, when they see a new – and it's interesting, you don't even see announcements of them in different
products many times. It's just – you're playing around with it and you see it. Now we of course will be using all
sorts of marketing methods to get and make sure our customers are aware of the better way to do your travel
planning, your travel execution, but I am not concerned at all that when we have that better product, I'm not
concerned that people won't know about it. People will know about it.

Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask two. First, you talked about the 15% of Booking.com bookings
using the payments platform. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of conversion
rates and speed to book and then other metrics that you may look at in payments?
And then secondly, Glenn, you mentioned wanting to expose flights ultimately to 50% of your customers. Just
curious why that's the number, kind of why you'd stop there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Well, we wouldn't actually stop there. That's just my target...

This year.

....for this year. We do intend to have 100% of the people eventually be exposed to it and we want 100% using it,
but this is – it takes time because of regulatory licensing things. It's not as though you can just immediately just
start selling airline tickets everywhere. That takes time to get your licenses in certain jurisdictions. And David...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, let me just characterize a little bit what we're seeing on the payment platform and why we think it's very
important both now and in the future.
So, the benefits come in different areas, and they're multiple and sometimes they are additive. So in some cases,
just offering people payments in different methodologies, payments in currency of their own choice or payment
processor of their own choice [indiscernible] (1:01:48), to offer a Chinese customer to pay in iPay, WeChat Pay or
something like that, just offering that payment choice even if the underlying hotel product is the same, we have
seen conversion increases even if people don't use our choice. It's a bit like offering something in the local
language, and of course, we offer our site in over 40 local languages. The fact that you offer something and
present it in somebody's native language or in this case you give them a payment choice that they recognize, is
actually something that by itself will help with conversion. We can demonstrate what that does ,albeit a small
amount, if they don't use payments, and then of course if they do use payments, it helps a little bit more.
So you do get some conversion benefits. But the other thing the payment platform will let us do as well is we can
also, as Glenn mentioned, we can start participating in the pricing process via merchandising more proactively.
So we can offer – basically Booking.com can get involved in that and offer Booking sponsor benefits or other
offers to the customer that you could only really do if you are participating as a merchant and you're taking the
payments on behalf of the property and passing it through.
So the other thing that the payment can do, the payment platform also will do is it'll help bridge a gap between a
customer and a property in terms of customers can pay in their payment platform or their payment currency of
choice, and we can pay out to the property partner in their payment currency of choice.

So for example, again, the hotel in Italy or in Paris may not take all the payment methods that we offer to our
Asian customers, and we can give them virtual credit cards, in for example, a MasterCard or a Visa format. So
there are all sorts of different benefits from the payments platform.
Another one I talked to you about that helps in the business as well is that the agency model, of course, leaves
the payment process open to the customer to deal with the property and vice versa, and we actually get a lot of
our customer service request calls are to do with things that go wrong somewhere or were not expected in that
equation between the property and the customer when we're not participating because we're just being agents
providing the booking. So we find that if we manage the payment process, we can reduce the number of customer
service incidents around the payment question, and actually increase the overall satisfaction and experience of
both the customer and the property partner.
So there are many benefits of the payment platform. As I said, I mentioned a few. In some cases, you get all of
them in one transaction. In some cases, you only get one. But it's something that we are developing rapidly inside
of Booking.com. Of course, we've got a lot of experience in payments in both Agoda and in Priceline, so we're
taking leverage of that capability where we've already seen those benefits occur.

Heath P. Terry
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you. You called out specifically the January 21 date as the one where you've sort of started to see
the headlines for coronavirus. Wondering if you could share with us sort of where your expectations were then for
bookings growth in the quarter just to get a better sense of sort of where the magnitude of the shift between then
and where we are now?
And then also on the – as we think about sort of where you're seeing the divergence in bookings growth and room
night growth continuing and spreading, I know in the past, you've talked about obviously that being a function of
cheaper ADRs. So I was wondering if maybe you could get a little bit more into detail with us on that as far as how
much of that is geographic, how much of that is you believe customers continuing to downshift to cheaper rooms,
and how much of it might be an access to inventory issue as hotels look to retain more of their compression
nights for their own platforms?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Sure. Let me take those in reverse order. So the ADR question probably the best place to go is back to Q4
because we're operating obviously in a business-as-usual type environment, and without going through a long
explanation because we gave a fairly long explanation as to what's happening to ADRs and why we saw that ADR
reduction in the fourth quarter, bear in mind part of it is because we were lapping a rather unusual increase a year
ago, so the four really became a three, if you normalized that.

And then we saw basically half of that decline due to lower rates in the key countries which were like US, Japan,
Hong Kong, of course again, on a pre-virus model, and some of that was macro, and about half of the decline in
ADRs was due to a shift towards lower ADR countries. Again, some of that was also macro because some of the
higher ADR countries got very expensive from an FX point of view. So when we go back and look at Q4 and look
at Q3, we saw basically 2 points of normalized reduction in ADRs in Q3 and 3 points in Q4.
We believe about half of that was kind of macro and half of that was mix related going forward. So hopefully that
gives you a little bit of flavor as to kind of what's going on.
Going into 2020, we expect the ADR reductions to be down to a couple of points again on a pre-coronavirus basis
basically just assuming that the macro piece of that continued with a little bit more in the first half and a little bit
less in the second half due to the lapping effect of what we saw occurring last year.
And just to go back to your very first part of the question, just like we try not to give specific guidance for where
we were for the year pre the coronavirus, and we did give you a fairly good flavor as to how we thought the
business would operate during the year pre the coronavirus, we try not to get into a lot of bridging exercises
between where we were at Q1 before and afterwards.
For what it's worth, I can tell you that we were tracking nicely ahead of our internal expectations for the first three
weeks in January, but that's only a three-week period of time. So take it for what it's worth, but we were running
slightly in front of the expectation we had for the year, which I outlined relative to when we talked about 2019 and
when we expected things to continue into 2020.
But I don't want to get into a specific, we thought room night growth would be X and now it's Y, because we can
never really compare against a hypothetical growth.
We were comfortable with where the year was shaping up. We felt good about the profile of business we talked
about in 2020 relative to what we saw in 2019 and the business model continuing, and hopefully that gives you a
flavor you can kind of really come to your own conclusion as to what it was. But we are pleased with how things
were shaping up going into 2020 and the shape of 2020 as we looked at the full year.

So this concludes the remarks, and I just want to end by saying in summary our 2019 performance met some
important financial and strategic goals, and I'm very pleased about the steps that we've taken to-date to provide
more value to the customers and our supply partners, and we look forward to doing more so in the future. And
we're going to manage through the current travel environment and I am very confident in our long-term prospects.
And finally, I want to thank our supplier marketing partners, our more than 26,000 employees distributed across
more than 300 offices, and a very special thank you to a subset of those 26,000 over the last couple of months
have been working so hard in this environment, and I want to thank them very much. And most of all, I want to
thank our traveler customers who are out there, exploring the world. Good night.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may

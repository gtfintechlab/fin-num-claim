Peggy Pinkston
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to Seagen's third quarter 2021 
financial results conference call. This afternoon, we issued a press release with our results, and the press release 
and supporting slides are available on our website in the Investors section, Events & Presentations page. 
Speakers on today's call will be Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Simpson, Chief 
Financial Officer; Chip Romp, Executive Vice President, Commercial US; and Roger Dansey, Chief Medical 
Officer.
Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the line for questions. We aim to keep this call to one hour, and so I 
ask that you limit yourself to one question to give everyone an opportunity to participate in Q&A during our call 
today.
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future or anticipated events and results, 
including the company's 2021 financial outlook, anticipated product sales, revenues, costs, and expenses, and 
potential clinical and regulatory milestones, including data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals. 
Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking 
statements.
Factors that may cause such a difference include the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and expenses, 
impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical development 
and regulatory approval process. More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seagen is 
contained under the caption Risk Factors included in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended June 30, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the company's subsequent

We continue to demonstrate robust financial strength fueled by product sales, royalties and multiple strategic 
collaborations. Our strong balance sheet allows us to advance and expand our pipeline both internally and 
through external business development efforts that you will hear more about shortly.
Our first strategic priority is to maximize the global potential of our products through exceptional commercial 
execution, clinical development and strategic partnerships. We've expanded our commercial portfolio from one 
product to four in less than two years, which is a remarkable achievement by our team.
Last month, FDA granted accelerated approval to tisotumab vedotin or TIVDAK, a tissue factor-targeted antibodydrug conjugate which we are co-developing with our partner, Genmab. TIVDAK is the first and only FDAapproved ADC for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after 
chemotherapy. Upon its accelerated approval in September, TIVDAK became Seagen's fourth commercial 
product and marks an important milestone for women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.
We are focused on strong commercial execution and early launch feedback has been positive. We're also 
conducting a broad clinical development program intended to expand TIVDAK's future potential and support 
global regulatory applications. Although, the initial indication represents a modest market, we have already 
presented promising data investigating TIVDAK in combination with other therapies in earlier lines of cervical 
cancer, which may represent important clinical advancements and much larger market opportunities.
TUKYSA, our best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has become an important option for the treatment of 
second- and later-line HER2-positive breast cancer patients with and without brain metastasis. TUKYSA is 
approved in 36 countries, and in addition to the US, we have commercially launched in Germany, France, 
Switzerland, and Austria.
A year-and-a-half after US approval, we are pleased with TUKYSA's uptake, healthcare provider feedback and 
inclusion in key treatment guidelines. We continue to engage with European authorities to secure broader 
reimbursement for TUKYSA, which can take up to two years, depending on the country. Our strategic 
collaboration with Merck will help further accelerate TUKYSA's global reach in regions outside of the US, Canada 
and Europe. We believe TUKYSA has broad potential in HER2 cancers. And to that end, we recently completed 
enrollment in the phase 2 MOUNTAINEER trial in advanced HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer, which 
could potentially support registration under FDA's accelerated approval pathway. TUKYSA's broad clinical 
development program also includes evaluation in HER2-positive breast cancer, gastric cancer and other HER2-
amplified or mutant tumors.
PADCEV is a first-in-class ADC that has quickly become standard of care in previously treated metastatic 
urothelial cancer. Earlier this year, FDA granted PADCEV a second indication, making it the first and only FDAapproved therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have received 
immunotherapy and cannot receive cisplatin. PADCEV also received regular US approval, enabling us to promote 
to the impressive overall survival data, a key benefit we have also been able to leverage with ADCETRIS and 
TUKYSA.
Outside of the US, PADCEV recently received approval in Japan; and we and our partner, Astellas, continue to 
make progress with global regulatory submissions across Europe, Asia Pacific and the Americas. We've 
positioned PADCEV strategically to benefit from changing urothelial cancer market dynamics, and we're 
advancing a robust clinical development program.

Notably, we recently completed enrollment in Cohort K of the EV-103 trial evaluating PADCEV in combination 
with KEYTRUDA as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who are unable to receive 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The results of this cohort could potentially support registration under FDA's 
accelerated approval pathway.
Lastly, ADCETRIS, the foundation of care in multiple CD30 expressing lymphomas is commercially available in 76 
countries along with our partner Takeda and is a key part of our core business. A decade after approval, 
ADCETRIS maintains solid performance with record quarterly sales and will be featured in multiple abstracts at 
ASH in December. We continue to progress a comprehensive clinical development program to maximize 
ADCETRIS's potential to benefit patients.
Our second strategic priority is to advance our programs toward securing approvals for new products. In August, 
we added a late-stage asset to our pipeline through an important license agreement with RemeGen for disitamab 
vedotin or DV outside of RemeGen's territory of Asia excluding Japan and Singapore. DV is a novel ADC that is 
active across a broad range of HER2 expressing solid tumors and is being developed as monotherapy and in 
combination with PD-1 inhibitors.
DV has already received conditional approval in China for third-line gastric cancer and their National Medical 
Products Administration accepted the Supplemental Biologics License Application for second- and later-lines of 
metastatic urothelial cancer. The deal represents a strong strategic fit as it harnesses our ADC technology 
expertise, development experience and our expanded global infrastructure. These elements will help to maximize 
DV's potential value and global reach. We believe DV is an important and differentiated asset and Roger will go 
into further detail.
Our third strategic priority is to expand our deep and diverse early-stage pipeline through innovation 
encompassing ADCs, immuno-oncology agents, corporate development, and strategic partnerships. Importantly, 
we're submitting at least two INDs for additional ADCs, including those targeted – targeting B7-H4 and PD-L1, 
further bolstering our early-stage pipeline. Across our early- and late-stage pipeline, we're advancing 13 programs 
in a range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including four novel programs that are expected to enter 
the clinic next year.
Next, I'll turn the call over to Todd who'll discuss our financial results. Then, Chip will provide an update on our 
commercial performance. After that, Roger will provide further detail on our clinical development activities and 
pipeline. Todd?

Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thanks, Clay, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Our financial results reflect 
significant advances made across the business. Today, I'll summarize our financial results for the third quarter 
and year-to-date and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2021.
Total revenues were $424 million in the third quarter and $1.145 billion for the year-to-date in 2021. Product sales 
totaled $366 million in the third quarter, representing 37% growth over the third quarter of last year. This was 
driven by growth in product sales across our portfolio.
In addition, third quarter results for PADCEV included $7 million in sales to another company for a combination 
clinical trial that they're conducting. Given the growing interest in the use of our drugs in combination settings, 
we're pleased to see this and wanted to highlight the impact on PADCEV sales growth this quarter.

Lastly, TIVDAK was launched late in the quarter, bringing a fourth product to our commercial portfolio. Royalty 
revenues were $41 million in the third quarter and $105 million for the year-to-date in 2021. Growth over 2020 
reflected increasing sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda, as well as higher royalties on sales of Polivy by Roche and 
Blenrep by GSK.
Collaboration revenues were $17 million in the third quarter and $24 million for the year-to-date in 2021. Third 
quarter revenues reflect the achievement of a regulatory milestone under our ADC collaboration with GSK, as well 
as sale of products supplied to one of our collaboration partners. Cost of sales was $83 million in the third quarter 
and $225 million for the year-to-date in 2021. This included product cost of sales and royalties for each of our 
brands, the PADCEV gross profit share to Astellas and noncash amortization of acquired technology costs for 
TUKYSA.
R&D expenses were $459 million in the third quarter and $924 million for the year-to-date in 2021. These are 
increases over 2020, as third quarter expenses included the $200 million upfront payment due to RemeGen for 
the licensing of disitamab vedotin, as well as continued investment across our early- and late-stage pipeline. 
SG&A expenses were $180 million in the third quarter and $505 million for the year-to-date in 2021. These are 
increases over 2020, reflecting investments to support ongoing TUKYSA launches across Europe and more 
recently, the launch of TIVDAK in the US.
I'll now provide several updates to our financial outlook for the remainder of 2021, beginning with product sales. 
We are increasing our 2021 product sales guidance for all three brands. ADCETRIS sales are now expected to be 
in the range of $700 million to $710 million, PADCEV in the range of $330 million to $335 million, and TUKYSA in 
the range of $315 million to $325 million. Chip will provide more context on market dynamics later.
We're increasing our 2021 guidance for royalty revenues to a range of $140 million to $150 million, primarily 
reflecting stronger sales of its ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. And lastly, we're increasing our 2021 
collaboration revenue guidance to a range of $25 million to $30 million.
Turning now to expenses, we're increasing R&D expense guidance to $1.19 billion to $1.24 billion, primarily as 
the result of the $200 million upfront amount due under the RemeGen collaboration. We're also increasing our 
cost of sales guidance to a range of $295 million to $315 million, primarily reflecting higher sales of PADCEV. And 
lastly, we're narrowing our SG&A guidance to $675 million to $725 million. Noncash expense guidance remains 
unchanged.
We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and investments. This does not reflect the $200 million payment to 
RemeGen made in the fourth quarter. Our financial strength allows us to continue investing in our pipeline and 
business, and we're pleased with the progress so far this year.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Chip for an overview of our commercial performance.

Thank you, Todd. Performance across the commercial portfolio was strong in Q3. ADCETRIS, PADCEV and 
TUKYSA, all delivered growth in the quarter, and we're pleased with the approval and launch of TIVDAK, our 
fourth product. ADCETRIS' third quarter sales were $185 million, a 13% increase over Q3 2020. We continue to 
focus on the landmark five-year ECHELON-1 progression-free survival data in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.

These are meaningful data to physicians and patients, and solidify the ADCETRIS regimen as the best option for 
frontline stage 3 or 4 patients.
August marked the 10-year anniversary of the first ADCETRIS approval, and I would like to thank the dedicated 
commercial teams that work diligently to ensure this important product gets to appropriate patients.
Moving on to PADCEV, third quarter sales were $95 million, a 54% increase over the third quarter of 2020. 
Physician adoption of checkpoint inhibitors for post-platinum maintenance continues to increase and this has 
generated more addressable patients for PADCEV. We're also promoting to the additional indication for patients 
who are ineligible for cisplatin containing chemotherapy and continue to see incremental uptake.
Transitioning to TUKYSA, third quarter sales were $87 million, representing a 104% increase over the third 
quarter of 2020. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth with contributions from the US and 
Europe. In patients with brain mets, TUKYSA is the most utilized product in second and later lines in the US.
In Europe, we continue to be pleased with uptake, the demonstrated overall survival benefit from the HER2CLIMB 
trial, along with favorable clinical guidelines, gives us confidence as we seek reimbursement in additional 
European countries. Finally, we were excited that TIVDAK has launched and we were pleased with early reaction 
from oncologists and we look forward to continuing to work closely with our partner, Genmab.
We're utilizing our well-established support program, Seagen Secure, to help navigate TIVDAK's eye care 
requirements. TIVDAK provides an important new medicine for patients in the second- and third-line setting, 
where previous options have typically offered low-objective response rates and poor outcomes. I look forward to 
providing more details on TIVDAK as we get further into the launch.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Chip, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to share recent clinical development updates for our 
approved medicines and our pipeline. I'll begin my remarks with TIVDAK, which is approved for the treatment of 
adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy.
Approval was based upon data from the innovaTV 204 trial, as well as other supportive studies. A global phase 3 
trial in cervical cancer, innovaTV 301, is currently enrolling a similar population and is intended to serve as a 
confirmatory trial in the United States and to support global regulatory applications. Our next goal is to bring 
TIVDAK into earlier lines of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer. And for that purpose, we are conducting the 
innovaTV 205 trial in the first- and second-line setting. Combination data from innovaTV 205 were recently 
presented at ESMO.
The combination of TIVDAK and carboplatin in the first-line setting resulted in the confirmed overall response rate 
of 55%, with a complete response of 12% and the duration of response of 8.3 months. In the second-line setting, 
the combination of TIVDAK and KEYTRUDA resulted in an ORR of 38% with a median DOR of 13.8 months. We 
are encouraged by these data, which will inform a TIVDAK-based combination approach for frontline cervical 
cancer.
In addition, the recent accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA in the first-line setting further defines the treatment 
landscape in which a TIVDAK combination will need be tested.

Turning now to TUKYSA, in the evolving HER2 treatment landscape, we continue to progress our broad 
development program in breast and GI malignancies, as well as other solid tumors. In breast cancer, the phase 3 
trial, HER2CLIMB-02, is evaluating TUKYSA plus KADCYLA versus KADCYLA alone in the first- and second-line 
metastatic setting. As a reminder, this trial is enrolling patients with active brain metastases, with similar eligibility 
to HER2CLIMB. In high-risk adjuvant breast cancer, enrollment continues in the randomized CompassHER2 RD 
trial, which is being run by the Alliance Cooperative Group. This study is evaluating TUKYSA plus KADCYLA 
versus KADCYLA alone.
In GI cancers, as Clay mentioned, we have completed enrollment in MOUNTAINEER, which is assessing 
TUKYSA and Herceptin as treatment for patients with advanced HER2-positive colorectal cancer. We anticipate 
results next year. And if the data are compelling, MOUNTAINEER could potentially support accelerated approval 
in the United States. Additional studies are evaluating TUKYSA in combination with oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapy in first-line GI cancers, as well as in the basket trial for solid tumors with HER2 alterations.
Finally, we are conducting a study of TUKYSA in combination with ENHERTU for HER2-positive breast cancer.
I will turn now to PADCEV where we remain focused on moving into earlier lines of urothelial cancer. In the firstline metastatic setting, we've completed enrollment of EV-103 Cohort K, which is testing the combination of 
PADCEV and KEYTRUDA as treatment for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin therapy. This trial is intended to 
support an application for accelerated approval in the United States, and we expect to report top line results in 
2022. We are also enrolling patients into the phase 3 EV-302 global trial, which includes both cisplatin-eligible and 
ineligible patients, and is assessing PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA compared to platinum-containing chemotherapy. 
EV-302 is intended to be a confirmatory trial as well as supporting global marketing applications.
In muscle invasive bladder cancer, we, together with Astellas and Merck, are advancing to phase 3 trials, both of 
which are testing PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA. The KEYNOTE-B15 or EV-304 trial is enrolling 
cisplatin-eligible patients and the KEYNOTE-905 of EV-303 trial is enrolling cisplatin-ineligible patients.
Additionally, we have now opened the EV-104 trial of single-agent PADCEV in non-muscle invasive bladder 
cancer. In this study, PADCEV is administered intravesically in BCG non-responsive patients. NECTIN4 is highly 
expressed in this disease state and preclinical data support this as a potential opportunity for PADCEV.
We are also evaluating PADCEV in a basket trial of high NECTIN4 expressing solid tumors, including lung, 
breast, head and neck, gastric and esophageal cancer. This study is enrolling and we await initial data to inform 
our next steps.
Now onto ADCETRIS, at the upcoming ASH meeting in December, we expect to have several presentations. 
Notably, we plan to present data for the first time from an ongoing phase 2 study, assessing ADCETRIS in 
combination with nivolumab, Adriamycin and dacarbazine as frontline treatment for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. 
We continue to advance our clinical development program, including ECHELON-3, the phase 3 trial in relapsed 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which compares ADCETRIS plus REVLIMID and Rituxan to REVLIMID and 
Rituxan.
Our newest entry into late-stage development is disitamab vedotin which has already received conditional 
approval as monotherapy in China for gastric cancer. The antibody which has a high affinity for HER2 and block 
signaling also demonstrates enhanced internalization when compared with trastuzumab. This is an important

characteristic for an antibody-drug conjugate. The ADC also delivers our proprietary vedotin payload, the same as 
in our three commercial ADCs.
Initial data in metastatic urothelial cancer was impressive and has already garnered breakthrough therapy 
designation from the FDA. Additionally, PD-1 inhibitor combination data were presented at ASCO this year 
demonstrating high response rates and these will also inform our clinical development plans. We are in active 
discussions with FDA on our urothelial cancer development strategy.
With regard to breast cancer, our partner, RemeGen, has generated initial encouraging monotherapy data in 
HER2 lower breast cancer and we are evaluating the potential here for future development.
Turning now to ladiratuzumab vedotin or LV which is being developed with our partner Merck. At ESMO this year, 
we presented initial efficacy data with the weekly dosing regimen of LV in patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer.
Data demonstrated that weekly LV results in a confirmed ORR of 28% in the second- and third-line setting. We 
continue to evaluate the optimal dose and schedule of LV, both as monotherapy and in combination with 
KEYTRUDA to optimize efficacy and safety.
I'd like to now briefly mention our early-stage pipeline. We're advancing seven programs in phase 1 clinical trials 
across a range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including the ADCs SGN-CD228A, SGN-B6A and 
SGN-STMV. We expect IND submissions for at least two more novel ADC programs this year targeting B7-H4 
and PD-L1.
At SITC in November, we will present posters on these programs, which will highlight robust anti-tumor activity in 
preclinical models. We also have four effector function enhanced antibodies utilizing our SEA technology 
including a SEA-CD40, SEA-CD70, SEA-BCMA and TIGIT. Later this year at ASH, we will be disclosing initial 
results of SEA-BCMA in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
With regard to SEA-CD40, as previously discussed, we completed enrollment of a cohort of patients with 
pancreatic cancer. We expect to report clinical data from this cohort early next year. We have also initiated a 
basket trial to assess SEA-CD40 in other solid tumors including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.
In closing, we continue to reach important development milestones and make meaningful progress with our 
pipeline, and we look forward to providing you with further updates on future calls. I'll hand the call now back to 
Clay.

Q
Hey, guys. It's [indiscernible] (00:28:43) for Geoff. Thanks for the question. Maybe one for Clay and one for Chip. 
First off, Clay, now that you have like a fourth approved product in the portfolio, maybe talk about how you're 
thinking about the balance of investing and keeping that early pipeline engine running while also moving toward a 
sustained profitability? And then on the TUKYSA launch OUS, maybe just help us understand what the 
reimbursement pathway looks like over the next 3 to 6 months or maybe 12 months even as you guys picture 
different geographies in the EU. Thank you.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Thanks for the questions. Okay. First of all, we do have four products now. We've had three products approved in 
the last two years. We're very proud of the products we have that really make a difference in patients' lives. We 
continue to invest strongly in our late-stage, mid-stage and early-stage products. We just submitted two INDs 
recently that Roger mentioned. We'll continue to push forward there. We intend to be profitable. We're not giving 
guidance today on when we're profitable but it's something that's important to us.
And – but it's also important to us to continue to build our pipeline. We're working together with our board of 
directors on the future and – of SGEN and where we're going and also working with some of our biggest investors 
who continue to encourage us to make great medicines and move on and this is the time to do that. We are 
investing heavily in our pipeline. So, that is where it is now. But please note, we do intend to be profitable and we 
could be profitable now by basically not working on our pipeline, not expanding our products. But that we don't 
think is the right way to build a big, profitable, self-sustaining organization that makes a huge difference in 
patients' lives. So, we're pursuing that.
And as far as TIVDAK and reimbursement, Chip, do you want to talk a little bit about the initial...

Great. Hey. This is [indiscernible] (00:31:35) for Cory. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on the 
updated revenue guide here. The new numbers seem to imply a sequential downturn [indiscernible] (00:31:44) 
your end or are there other market dynamics that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to Q4 here? 
Thank you.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, thanks for the question. First of all, we are very pleased with our quarterly and year-to-date performance. Our 
net product sales were up 37% year-over-year in third quarter of 2021. So, that's great. We have great products 
that make a difference in patients' lives. We have increased not only the three – our three initial products, TIVDAK 
is too new for guidance right now, but we also increased our other revenue metrics, which is royalties in 
partnering.
So, all five of our revenue metrics, we increased. Our focus is on the long game, making a difference in patients' 
lives, expanding our labels, maximizing the potential and reach of our drugs, going worldwide. We're investing in 
going into a much bigger footprint globally to help more patients. And we believe that this is going to make the 
company stronger in the not too distant future. We're – but it takes some investment to do that. And we're really 
excited about that.
As far as thinking about the fourth quarter, Todd, do you want to give a little color to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. So, you mentioned, are we trying to be conservative, we're actually trying to just be as accurate as we can. 
We recognize that COVID continues to create a lot of just uncertainties. And our drug sales fluctuate quarter to 
quarter. So, with that in mind, what we've always tried to do is just do the best job we can on annual guidance and 
we look forward to giving our 2022 guidance on the next quarterly call. But as Clay mentioned, we're really

Salveen Richter
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you just comment on any granularity on the TIVDAK 
launch at this point? And then just timeline updates or what we should expect next on the TIGIT and LV 
programs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, we are really excited about getting TIVDAK on the market. And it's early, but really good feedback. 
Chip, would you like to talk a little bit about what's it like out there in the field and what commercial see?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seagen Inc. A
Sure. We're really pleased with the initial reactions we've had from oncologists and look forward to continuing to 
work closely with our partner, Genmab. Physicians are excited about having the option of TIVDAK. It represents 
the first and only FDA-approved ADC in the metastatic cervical cancer setting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
And then switching to your second question. So, let's start with one at a time. So, TIGIT is a product we're really 
excited about. It's in clinical trials. We think it's differentiated from the other TIGITs out there because of our SEA 
technology, and that's in trials. And LV is also in a number of trials.
Roger, could you comment a little bit about TIGIT and where we are and what we're thinking and then about LV?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Clay. So, with regards to TIGIT, we understand the environment around us. There're lots of other 
companies working on the TIGIT program for good reason because the early proof of concept is there. So, we
understand that time is of the essence. We also need to essentially develop TIGIT in the way that we can if we 
are differentiated clinically, and be able to demonstrate that. So, I can just say we're working hard on the TIGIT 
program. We're not ready for prime time yet, but we are moving along expeditiously.
With regard to LV, as you know, we have presented multiple data sets now that LV is an active drug, both as a 
monotherapy and in combination. And we're continuing to work hard with our partners, Merck, to see if we can 
optimize dosing schedule and then move it into a pivotal trial. But we're not there yet; again stay tuned for more 
data as the program unfolds.

Yige Guo
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Hi. This is Yige Guo for Michael. Thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the impressive results of 
this quarter. We have a question on TUKYSA. Now that the ENHERTU reported positive results in the second-line 
breast cancer, do you think this will drive the HER2CLIMB-02 study towards enrolling more patients with brain 
mets? And what proportion of patients do you expect to have brain mets in that study? And perhaps a related 
question to this, on the phase 2 study of TUKYSA plus ENHERTU, what are you specifically looking at in that 
study and what could be the potential next step? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, thanks for the questions. Two good questions on TUKYSA. Roger, can you start with the brain mets question 
that – concerning HER2CLIMB...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. And then the next one on ENHERTU plus TUKYSA.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Right. So, with regard to our development program, as you know, we've demonstrated remarkable treatment 
effects in patients with brain metastases, such a high unmet need. And also, as we know, HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer does have a high frequency of brain mets, up to 50% of patients will develop brain mets 
through their disease course.
And so, it's expected that a program such as HER2CLIMB, HER2CLIMB-02, where we are allowing patients with 
active brain mets to enroll, will in fact enroll a decent proportion of patients with brain metastases. We can't share 
with you any of the information on HER2CLIMB-02 as it is, but just in principle, a drug like TUKYSA will be 
attractive for patients with brain metastases.
With regard to ENHERTU, from a sort of development perspective, the two most – the most interesting drugs in 
the HER2 breast cancer space right now are TUKYSA and ENHERTU. From a mechanistic perspective, 
combining an ADC like ENHERTU together with TUKYSA makes complete sense. As you can see in our 
development program, we've done that. We have that same approach with KADCYLA.

So, we're looking forward. We're still in the process of enrolling. We're looking forward to what those results may 
produce. And of course, if those results are compelling, we will need to think through what next steps there could 
be. But again, we wouldn't disclose any of that at this point. We're still in the process of data generation.

Kennen Mackay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the Q3 performance. I had another question on the guidance. 
Maybe for Todd, just on the increased guide for royalty revenues, I was wondering if you could help us with sort of 
where we should think about that coming from potentially. Is that coming from Polivy [ph] and the label (00:39:57) 
there or whether it's something else?
And then just maybe going back to the PADCEV guide, after really a quite impressive quarter of 15% quarterover-quarter growth, just wondering if you could help us understand what dynamics could be related to then be 
expecting a decline in Q4 here or whether there's any seasonality. Again, just trying to understand the dynamics. 
Thanks and congrats again on the Q3 performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Thanks, Kennen. So, good questions. Let me start with the royalty up-guide. As I think I mentioned earlier, the 
principal reason for that is related to Takeda sales of ADCETRIS, stronger than what we had thought of a year 
ago when we set our guidance. So, we're delighted to see that ADCETRIS is doing so well in Takeda's territories.
And then, you mentioned Polivy and Blenrep. Those two are starting to contribute to royalties. They're lower in 
amount than the Takeda royalties, but it's great to see the benefit that both these drugs probably Polivy in 
particular and the way that looks like it's moving forward now in the frontline. So, we're really happy with that.
And then on the PADCEV guide, I mentioned also that we had a clinical supply order from another company. I 
wanted to call that out in the remarks I made earlier because while it is $7 million and again not that significant to 
the overall picture, it nevertheless was a pretty meaningful driver of growth in Q3. We did see also commercial 
growth, so I wanted to point that out.
And as we look into Q4, it's a situation where PADCEV has rapidly become a standard of care. We've now got 
both the Cohort 1 and the Cohort 2 labels. We're super-happy with where we are. But there's uncertainty and 
quarterly fluctuations. So, we've just tried to do the best we can across the board actually with all of our guidance, 
but PADCEV as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Boris Peaker
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Great. My question is on the Daiichi litigation. I was just wondering if you could comment specifically maybe on 
the timing of the arbitration. But also second scenario is since there is a lawsuit and a trial starting next April, just 
curious what the – what would happen if you win the arbitration but then lose the lawsuit on the patent litigation? 
Would they still owe you royalties in ENHERTU in that scenario?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, Boris, thanks for the question on the Daiichi Sankyo legal issues. So, first of all, as per our guidance, we have 
said that we believe there'll be a – the arbitration and the retired federal judge in the arbitration will announce the 
findings from that before the end of the year. And so, that's something we have been public about. And you're 
right, there is a patent infringement case that we brought forward which is being heard in April. So, you are correct 
on both of those.
As far as really – one really on another, that's basically something we wouldn't comment on. It's inner workings of 
the legal system. And we have a great legal team. We think we have a great case in both regards, both with the 
arbitration, which is based on our contract that we had with Daiichi Sankyo and based on the patent infringement 
based on issued patent that we have on our technology. So, they're different cases, they're not the same, and we 
feel like we have a great case for both. So, we're looking forward.
The most important thing for us is to develop drugs and make a difference in cancer patients' lives, and so don't 
go away from that. But it's also – we work with a lot of other companies. And when we work with a company and 
we do deals with them, we expect to continue to – if they're using our technology, we expect to be their partner. 
And so, that's where this is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Boris Peaker
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Got it. And maybe let me ask a follow-up question not related to the litigation. But I'm just curious with the strong 
data that we recently saw for ENHERTU versus KADCYLA in breast cancer, how does that impact your 
development strategy for the – particularly the recently licensed HER2 ADC from RemeGen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, thanks for that. The product from RemeGen is really interesting. It internalizes very rapidly. Keep in mind that 
whether the original HER2 ADC KADCYLA or ENHERTU, they both use the same antibody component, which is 
trastuzumab, which we know as Herceptin. And that molecule internalizes, but it's kind of middle of the road 
internalization. The antibody used in RC48, which is what we licensed from RemeGen, that was a unique 
antibody and was selected based on incredibly rapid internalization. And one of the things that we've been able to 
see based on what RemeGen did with their data, which we did a lot of diligence on, was its impact on HER2-low 
patients. And that's a big area. In fact, that's a bigger area than HER2-high. And so, we think this rapid 
internalization could be something really exciting.
They have data. I mean, they're approved in gastric cancer in China. They have breakthrough designation for 
urothelial cancer in the US with the FDA. And certainly, the data they have in HER2-low breast cancer and other

HER2-low tumors is very interesting. They even have data in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, which is not 
surprising to us since with our other ADCs, they use vedotin, we see very nice activity with checkpoint inhibitors 
such as KEYTRUDA.
So, we think all-in-all, we have a very nice profile there. And yes, ENHERTU is a good drug, it's an important 
drug. And we – on behalf of cancer patients, we love when we see new drugs. This is great. That's our goal. It's 
been my passion and goal for my whole career. So, I think that there's a lot of room for cancer patients to have 
different types of therapies.
Roger, do you want to add anything to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. I think we're in a fortunate position in that we have a highly valuable and active small molecule TKI in 
TUKYSA, which is in the HER2 space. We now have a HER2 directed antibody with properties that we think is –
are very interesting. And we have the external environment, which includes drugs like KADCYLA which we're 
combining with and ENHERTU which we're exploring in combination with TUKYSA. So, there's lot of possibilities 
for us going forward. We are not changing TUKYSA development program as it is right now. But what are the next 
steps with regard to things like tisotumab vedotin in combination with TUKYSA or ENHERTU in combination with 
TUKYSA. I think all of those things are on the table for exploration going forward.

Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my questions. So, maybe just to follow the IP, the arbitration, just want to make sure, Clay, 
so would the timing still be 4Q and how would you share that information with investors. And then also another 
question regarding RemeGen's the DV compound, just wondering how's the data comparison, efficacy safety, 
especially say in HER2-low compared to, say, ENHERTU the ADC profile.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Well, I'll try to take the first part of the question about the arbitration and then I'll turn it over to Roger to talk
about his view of the differences in safety between RC48 and the vedotins versus ENHERTU. So, on the 
arbitration, we feel that we're confident based on where we sit and based on hearing from our internal and 
external counsel that there'll be a resolution of some type in the arbitration case, not in the patent infringement 
case which starts in April but in the arbitration case prior to the end of the year.
And that's something that I think would be shared with the investors. We'd probably put out some sort of press 
release or something like that on it. We look forward to that. Once again, we think we have a strong case. We've 
been going at this now for some time and look forward to getting it resolved.
Roger, on the safety?

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. With regard to the sort of the clinical profile, the data that RemeGen has generated to date looks pretty 
impressive. It's not that dissimilar from ENHERTU, and I think we obviously, Seagen, need to generate our own 
data with the population defined as a HER2-low and determine what our next steps are. But we see this as a 
meaningful – really meaningful opportunity and it may not necessarily be limited to breast cancer.
With regard to the efforts that the HER2-low program in China has generated, we will obviously also leverage as 
much as possible data from China to supplement whatever efforts we make in the United States.

Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the beat-and-raise quarter. I've a question about 
the EV-104 study that you kind of unveiled today. So, in terms of the intravesical administration of PADCEV, 
curious how you think about the dosing since we usually think about that in a systemic sense. And also for the 
maintenance phase, also curious about your thinking about stopping dosing at month 10 to 11 versus maybe a 
longer treatment duration. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Andy, thank you for those questions. Roger, do you want to take those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Andy. So, yeah, we're excited. The non-muscle invasive bladder cancer opportunity for PADCEV 
could be very meaningful. Just to remind you, at least in our hands preclinically, when we introduce PADCEV into 
the bladder and not expose it systemically, we really expect that the safety profile will look more favorable than 
systemic therapy. Obviously, we have to generate the data in humans, but the preclinical package supports that, 
so very little systemic exposure.
With regard to dose, it's a great question. The trial has just begun. We are using the current commercially 
available PADCEV image, and we're hoping that we will be able to define an efficacious dose using that current 
formulation. That's certainly in our plan.
With regard to beyond the initial sort of induction through to maintenance, Andy, I think when we share details of 
the trial itself to things like poster presentations, I think that would be a good time to address some of those 
points. But obviously, we're just beginning. So, understanding all the way through what our eventual plan may 
look like, it's a little difficult at this point to predict.

Oh, hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. Can you talk about your first-line 
combination strategy that you're planning for TIVDAK? And also, when should we expect to see some data for 
TIVDAK in other tumor types? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, thank you for the words about our quarter. We are really excited about TIVDAK. We presented some 
combination data two different ways at ESMO, and certainly going to earlier lines is very important for us.
Roger, do you want to talk a little bit about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. So, frontline cervical cancer, the standard of care is combination chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab. The recent reveal of KEYTRUDA as an addition to that combination, adds another layer of drug, 
but actually produces a much better outcome.
So, when you think about how to move into a frontline space and create a regimen that is competitive, that is 
potentially better than the various current standards of care, we see with TIVDAK as the, sort of, backbone of that 
regimen. We believe combining it with chemotherapy, certainly based on the carboplatin-TIVDAK combination 
we've seen will be an important element. We also believe that pembrolizumab will be an important element.
And we need – we've shown already the doublets. We need to go further. We need to put into the clinic and test 
what we would consider to be the final regimen that would be included in a frontline study, and that's exactly what 
we're doing now.

Zhiqiang Shu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter as well. I like to ask about the SEA-BCMA program that you're going 
to present at ASH. What are we going to see at this initial data presentation? And I guess, can you comment on 
the market opportunity for this drug? Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. So, first of all, on the market opportunity, this is in an area that is mainly targeted to multiple myeloma. It's a 
substitutive market. There's great drugs out there like REVLIMID and VELCADE and antibodies CD38 and other 
drugs. So, there really is good, different therapies out there. But the disease is certainly not cured where it sits. 
These are therapies that have extended the life of patients, but in MM, there really is still always room for a great 
drugs to come in, especially ones that have very low safety signals. And like what we would expect with SEABCMA.
Roger, could you talk a little bit about the drug and what are our thoughts on there? And obviously, as far as ASH 
goes, until we present, we're not going to – it's not appropriate to talk about the presentation. Roger, could give 
you give a little color on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, the clinical trial program with the SEA-BCMA has been running for a little while now and we've been 
evaluating it as a monotherapy and we've been looking at various ways of dosing it. We've been evaluating it in 
combination with dexamethasone, which is a – essentially a almost sort of mandatory combination drug in 
multiple myeloma. And so, it's that type of data in late-line myeloma patients that we will be presenting. And we 
obviously – at this point, we believe that the data is mature enough and meaningful enough but it's time for us to 
produce this in a public forum.
So, we're looking forward to presenting the BCMA initial data – it is initial data at ASH this year.

But clearly, we're looking at bladder cancer where there's already breakthrough designation. Clearly, we're 
looking at HER2-low breast cancer, where there's a big slug of data. And also, we can't look past gastric cancer. I 
mean, it's an important cancer that's already approved in China. So, there's a lot of different possibilities for this 
drug. And I think, we are very – we're just well-positioned to take this forward and make it into a real product that 
could get out on a global scale, not just in China right now, so.
Roger, do you want to comment more about the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. With regard to urothelial cancer, the data that's been generated by RemeGen is really impressive. Bear in 
mind that this was a HER2-defined population, which is something that will need some work in bladder cancer 
because it isn't a population that has sort of up to this point been readily identified, but a biomarker-driven 
population of HER2-high expressers and perhaps the HER2-low group in bladder cancer are – is the population 
we're interested in.
And as Clay mentioned, essentially as this drug comes into our hands, we'll look at all the opportunities in HER2 
disease, whether it's traditional over-amplification or overexpression or HER2-low. So, I think all possibilities are 
on the table, but our initial focus is on urothelial cancer and on HER2-low breast cancer.

And just as a follow-up, Roger, do you have a sense as to the potential overlap between that expression – the 
HER2 expression in NECTIN4, or are they kind of maybe a little bit exclusive?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. NECTIN4 expression we see as sort of near ubiquitous.

Reni J. Benjamin
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Q
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
HER2 expression is obviously more limited. I think the epidemiology of urothelial cancer is less well-defined, and 
that's something that we need to work on. And I think when we have a clear and accurate view of the distribution

of traditional HER2-high versus HER2-low in bladder cancer or urothelial cancer, we'll bring that forward. But it is 
not the whole population. Obviously, it is a biomarker-defined group of patients.

Joseph M. Catanzaro
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and taking my question here. Just maybe one quick one from 
me. So, Roger, you had mentioned a new basket combination trial for SEA-CD40. Wondering if you could 
elaborate a little bit on that and maybe how your experience in pancreatic cancer and the combination you're 
looking at there informed your decision to start this trial. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. It's a great question. I think we believe strongly in the scientific hypothesis, which is the combination of an 
agonist – a CD40 agonist, together with agents that injure and kill cancer cells and potentially also as well 
together with PD-1 inhibitors that relieve the exhausted T cell population. That as a scientific construct test, we 
think, is really interesting. Obviously, pancreatic cancer is our first foray into that. Pancreatic cancer, as you well 
know, is not an easy disease to treat. It is, I guess, traditionally considered to be less immune responsive than 
other tumors. And that's why we're taking the basket trial further into diseases where, in fact, immunotherapy is 
already proven to work. So, we think it makes sense to continue to test this approach in other tumors as well. So, 
that's why we're opening up this basket trial which will include diseases like non-small cell lung cancer and 
melanoma.

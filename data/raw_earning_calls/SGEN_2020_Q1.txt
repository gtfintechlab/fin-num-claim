Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thank you, Peggy, and good afternoon, everyone.
Seattle Genetics has made remarkable progress over the past few months. I've been extremely proud of our 
accomplishments and the focus and creativity of our team during a period of significant global and individual 
impact. We broadened our commercial portfolio, which now includes three first-in-class or best-in-class medicines 
for cancer patients. ADCETRIS is an important global brand for lymphoma and we are investing in future growth 
opportunities. PADCEV was approved in late December for metastatic urothelial cancer. And today, we are 
pleased to announce a strong first full quarter of sales. And earlier this month, we received approval of TUKYSA 
for metastatic breast cancer, four months ahead of the PDUFA date. These are significant milestones and we

remain excited with the expansion opportunities across these three programs as well as our emerging earlierstage pipeline.
I'll begin today with some comments on each of our approved programs, starting with ADCETRIS. We're pleased 
to report ADCETRIS net sales of $164 million in the first quarter of 2020, up 22% over the first quarter of 2019. 
We are maintaining our guidance of full year 2020 ADCETRIS net sales in the range of $675 million to $700 
million. Our ADCETRIS partner, Takeda, continues to make global regulatory progress. Most recently, CHMP 
adopted a positive opinion recommending extension of the marketing authorization for ADCETRIS plus 
chemotherapy for frontline systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma based on results from the ECHELON-2 trial. 
We look forward to additional frontline Hodgkin and PTCL approvals in Takeda's territory over time.
We believe there are several additional opportunities for ADCETRIS and are advancing ongoing and planned 
clinical trials in a range of settings. These include retreatment use in patients who are unfit for combination 
chemotherapy, novel frontline Hodgkin lymphoma combinations and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma. We also expect to report five-year progression-free survival results later this year from both the 
ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials. These data could further establish the positive long-term benefit of the 
approved ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy regimen in frontline Stage 3 and 4 Hodgkin lymphoma and in frontline 
CD30-expressing PTCL.
I'll move on now to PADCEV, which we're developing and commercialization in collaboration with Astellas. 
PADCEV was approved in late December 2019, three months ahead of the PDUFA date. In its first full quarter on 
the market, PADCEV net sales in US were $34 million. We're pleased by the initial physician and patient 
reception to PADCEV as well as our commercial team's ability to shift mid-quarter to a virtual engagement. There 
are additional opportunities for PADCEV in earlier lines and stages of bladder cancer. A primary focus of this work 
is evaluating PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA. In the past month, we've made important progress with 
both first-line metastatic urothelial cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer that Roger will describe in more 
detail. Looking beyond bladder cancer, the first patient was recently dosed an EV-202 basket trial evaluating 
single-agent PADCEV in a range of solid tumors.
Our third and newest commercial product is TUKYSA, the brand name for tucatinib. We're very pleased with the 
strong label granted by FDA. TUKYSA is approved for use in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for 
patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases who have received 
one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. This positions the regimen as an option for 
second-line treatment. We're almost two weeks into the launch of TUKYSA, which we're conducting through 
virtual communication channels. We've been pleased by the reception from the breast cancer community to this 
new treatment option for patients. To maximize the potential of TUKYSA, we're investing in a broad development 
program across HER2-positive cancers. In addition, we're preparing for European commercial operations and 
have hired general managers in major European markets ahead of potential ex-US approvals of TUKYSA.
Turning now to our pipeline, on the horizon with the clinical trial readout is tisotumab vedotin, or TV, which we're 
developing in collaboration with Genmab. We're conducting a pivotal Phase 2 single-arm single-agent trial in 
women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer where there is no standard of care and outcomes are poor. 
We expect to report top line results late this quarter or into the third quarter.
Our early-stage clinical pipeline is robust. It includes ADCs such as ladiratuzumab vedotin, SGN-CD228 and [ph] 
SGN-B6A (00:07:40) for which an IND had just been submitted. These three ADCs are all targeted to receptors 
that are widely expressed in solid tumors. To expand upon our deep knowledge of CD30-expressing malignancies 
and our expertise in CD30-directed ADCs, we are advancing another IND candidate this year called SGN-CD30C.

This is a novel anti-CD30 ADC that has the potential for enhanced activity and improved tolerability compared to 
ADCETRIS. Preclinical data on SGN-CD30C will be presented along with several other abstracts on our research 
at the AACR Virtual Annual Meeting in June. In addition to ADCs, we've made progress with novel 
immunotherapy agents in our early-stage clinical pipeline. These include SEA-CD40 and SGN-TGT.
Lastly, I wanted to provide an update on our dispute with Daiichi Sankyo regarding ownership of certain 
technology used in the breast cancer drug and HER2 and other product candidates. According to our agreement, 
this type of dispute should be resolved through arbitration. Daiichi Sankyo has been trying to prevent our dispute 
from going to arbitration through actions in Federal Court. On April 27, it was ruled that the dispute should be 
resolved in arbitration and that the arbitration process should move forward. We view this as a positive 
development.
With our diverse commercial portfolio, growing revenues and multiple programs that provide significant 
opportunities in a range of cancer types, we are well-positioned for the future.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Chip to discuss our commercial activities. Then Todd will comment on our 
financial results. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities. Chip?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles (Chip) Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Clay. I am excited to update you on our commercial activities.
ADCETRIS net sales growth in the US and Canada in the first quarter was driven by our frontline indications in 
Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL. As Clay mentioned, we look forward to the five-year PFS data later this year from 
the ECHELON-1 trial. Five-year data are an established standard that we believe will resonate with some
physicians who have been slow to adopt ADCETRIS plus AVD in the frontline setting. In PTCL, ADCETRIS has 
become the standard of care for patients with ALCL. One of our areas for focus in 2020 is to increase use in 
additional CD30-expressing subtypes.
Now I'd like to transition to PADCEV. In the first full quarter since launch, net sales were $34 million. We are very 
pleased with these early results and with the strong uptick, particularly in the community setting. We are still early 
into the launch and our goal with PADCEV is to maintain our strong momentum. Along with our Astellas 
colleagues, we're working hard to support our customers and to drive awareness and understanding of this 
important new treatment option for metastatic urothelial patients seeking treatment after platinum and PD-1 or 
PD-L1 therapy.
And finally, our third product is TUKYSA. The commercial team was ready for the rapid approval, marketing 
materials were complete, physician and patient websites were up the day of approval and the dedicated TUKYSA 
sales force comprised of breast cancer [ph] specialist (00:11:16) was trained and ready. Interest in the product is 
very high and our field sales teams are reporting good virtual access to customers. TUKYSA is available in our 
distribution networks and accounts are beginning to order. I look forward to updating you on our progress in future 
calls.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Todd.

Thanks, Chip, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Our financial results for the first 
quarter reflects significant progress across the business, including a strong first quarter of PADCEV sales. Today, 
I'll summarize our results for the first quarter and then comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2020.
Total revenues were $235 million in the first quarter of 2020. This included ADCETRIS net sales of $164 million 
and PADCEV net sales of $34 million. As a reminder, we record 100% of PADCEV sales in the US under our copromote with Astellas. Royalty revenues in the first quarter of 2020 increased to $20 million compared to $16 
million in the first quarter of 2019. This growth primarily reflects sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda and to a lesser 
degree now royalties on sales of Polivy by Roche. Collaboration revenues were $16 million in the first quarter of 
2020 compared to $45 million in the first quarter of last year. The decrease in collaboration revenues is the result 
of a $30 million milestone from Takeda earned last year that was triggered by the approval of ADCETRIS in the 
EU for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.
Positive sales for the first quarter of 2020 increased to $29 million and now reflects both ADCETRIS and 
PADCEV, including the PADCEV profit share to Astellas that was $16 million in the first quarter. Beginning in the 
second quarter, cost of sales will also reflect TUKYSA and will also include the non-cash amortization of acquired 
in-process R&D that was part of the Cascadian acquisition. We plan to provide further guidance on cost of sales 
on future calls.
R&D expenses were $195 million in the first quarter of 2020. Growth over 2019 reflects higher investment across 
our pipeline. SG&A expenses were $122 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase over 2019 reflects 
commercialization efforts related to the launches of PADCEV and TUKYSA.
We ended the first quarter with $800 million in cash and investments. In addition, we held approximately $104 
million in Immunomedics common stock at the end of the quarter. These shares are marked to market, which 
resulted in a non-cash loss that contributed to an overall investment loss of $56 million for the first quarter. We 
monetized the remaining portion of our investment in April, which generated cash of $175 million. We acquired 
this investment back in 2017 and our total gain, when also including prior-year sales, was $210 million.
Regarding our financial outlook for 2020, product sales will now include all three brands. At this point, we're not 
providing guidance for PADCEV or TUKYSA and our ADCETRIS guidance is unchanged from our expectations 
provided in February.
We expect R&D expenses to increase as trials of PADCEV and TUKYSA ramp up. SG&A expense growth in 
2020 is primarily driven by the US launches of both PADCEV and TUKYSA. Our guidance for R&D and SG&A 
expenses remains unchanged.
Lastly, we continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We have implemented a number 
of measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, patients and healthcare professionals while also 
taking steps to advance our operations. These include efforts to mitigate disruptions to our supply chain and 
continue clinical trial and commercial activities. To-date, we're pleased with the continuity of our business and in 
our ability to support the critical need of cancer patients for treatment. However, COVID-19 has created a 
dynamic environment that may impact the company over time. We will keep investors updated as appropriate 
going forward.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Roger.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to update you today on our clinical development and 
regulatory activities and the work we're undertaking to maximize the therapeutic potential of our programs.
I'll start with PADCEV, our ADC directed against nectin-4, which is ubiquitously expressed in bladder cancer. As 
you know, data from the first cohort of the EV-201 trial supported approval of PADCEV in metastatic urothelial 
cancer patients following treatment with a platinum-containing regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Earlier this 
month, we completed enrollment in the second cohort, which is evaluating patients who received the PD-1 or PDL1 inhibitor but who are not eligible for treatment with cisplatin. We believe data from the second cohort of EV-201 
could potentially support a second indication for PADCEV.
Our other key activity of PADCEV monotherapy is the ongoing randomized Phase 3 EV-301 trial in advanced 
urothelial cancer. Enrollment of 608 patients was completed early this year and we are following patients for the 
primary endpoint of overall survival. EV-301 is intended to serve as a confirmatory study for EV-201 and support 
global regulatory applications for approval.
PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer is another key effort. At the 
ASCO GU meeting in February, we reported updated results from the EV-103 trial of 45 metastatic urothelial 
cancer patients who were previously untreated and ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The objective 
response rate was 73% and median duration of response had not been reached. Median progression-free 
survival was 12 months and median overall survival was not reached. The safety profile appeared consistent with 
individual components of the combination, including rash, hypoglycemia, peripheral neuropathy and immunemediated events. These data supported breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for PADCEV in 
combination with KEYTRUDA in this setting. This is our second PADCEV [ph] BDD (00:18:22).
Based on discussion with the FDA, we are pleased that EV-103 now has the potential to support an accelerated 
approval for PADCEV in first-line cisplatin-ineligible metastatic disease. In January, we added cohort K to the trial 
which will enroll 150 patients randomized to receive either PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA or PADCEV alone. The 
primary endpoint is objective response rate supported by duration of response. This accelerated pathway would 
be complementary to the randomized Phase 3 EV-302 trial that is intended to support global registration and now 
also serves as a potential confirmatory trial.
Today, we are announcing that we have treated the first patient in EV-302. In this trial together with Astellas and 
Merck, we are evaluating the PADCEV and KEYTRUDA combination with or without chemotherapy compared to 
chemotherapy alone. Target enrollment is 1,095 patients and importantly includes all patients whether they are
cisplatin-eligible or ineligible and irrespective of PD-L1 expression. The trial is evaluating dual primary endpoints 
of progression=free and overall survival. In early bladder cancer, Seattle Genetics, Astellas and Merck recently 
completed a clinical trial agreement under which we will evaluate PADCEV and KEYTRUDA in muscle invasive 
bladder cancer by adding an arm to an ongoing Merck Phase 3 registrational trial. Under this agreement, we are 
providing PADCEV and Merck will continue to fund and operationalize the study. This expedites the development 
of the PADCEV-KEYTRUDA combination in this setting.
I'll now move on to TUKYSA, our recently approved oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. We're very 
pleased by the FDA label and the speed at which we received approval and the FDA's real-time oncology review. 
We believe that the activities seen in HER2CLIMB trial establishes TUKYSA as a best-in-class HER2 TKI. At the 
ASCO Virtual Scientific Program in late May, we will present analyses on patients with brain metastases in 
HER2CLIMB to further demonstrate the treatment effects of TUKYSA observed in the brain. The data which was

selected for an oral presentation will provide more insights into this aspect of the trial. Our ongoing regulatory 
efforts with HER2CLIMB includes marketing applications that are currently under review in Switzerland, 
Singapore, Australia and Canada as part of Project Orbis and also in the EU.
We are also evaluating TUKYSA in a randomized Phase 3 trial called HER2CLIMB-02 in combination with T-DM1 
versus T-DM1 alone in metastatic breast cancer including patients with brain metastases. In this trial, patients 
must have previously received a taxane and trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting and 
thus represents a population receiving first or second-line treatment.
HER2CLIMB-02 remains a key part of our TUKYSA development program. Both TUKYSA and T-DM1 are 
important drugs for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers. And if HER2CLIMB-02 is successful, it will 
support use of the combination in the first-line metastatic setting thus expanding beyond the current label. In 
addition, given the demonstrated activity of TUKYSA in patients with brain mets, the combination may also 
improve outcomes for these patients. Enrollment in HER2CLIMB-02 is ongoing with a target of 460 patients. The 
primary endpoint is progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints are overall survival and PFS in 
patients with brain mets.
Lastly on TUKYSA, we previously outlined our plans in neoadjuvant breast cancer and metastatic colorectal 
cancer, and those efforts are continuing. Trials in adjuvant breast cancer, gastric cancer and HER2-mutant or 
amplified cancers are in the planning phase.
Next I'll turn to ADCETRIS. We recently expanded our clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to further 
evaluate the combination of ADCETRIS and OPDIVO in an ongoing clinical trial. The focus of this new effort will 
be to assess the combination plus chemotherapy in Stage 1 and 2 Hodgkin lymphoma. This approach brings 
together two of the most active agents in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma. Our goal is to improve efficacy while 
reducing toxicity by limiting the chemotherapy components of the regimen.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Clay.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Roger. Before we open the line for questions, I want to recap key upcoming activities across our 
oncology portfolio. They include, first, continue to establish ADCETRIS as standard of care in frontline Hodgkin 
lymphoma and frontline PTCL and initiate additional clinical trials. Second, continue our strong PADCEV launch in 
the US with Astellas and advance the broad development program including trials in first-line metastatic and 
muscle invasive bladder cancer. Third, continue to launch TUKYSA following the recent FDA approval and 
advance its robust clinical development program. And fourth, report top line results from the TV pivotal trial in 
cervical cancer. We look forward to continuing our momentum into the remainder of the year.
At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Salveen Richter with 
Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Salveen Richter
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Thank you and congratulations on the PADCEV launch. What has been the key drivers for the rapid uptake here 
for PADCEV and how should we think about the launch trajectory [ph] on the forward (00:24:51) and maybe you 
can just comment on that part as to whether there was a bolus of patients in 1Q? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yes. Salveen, thank you very much for the question. We are delighted with our first full quarter of PADCEV sales 
at $34 million. And as I previously had mentioned on other calls that along the way that was exceeding our 
expectations early on. We mentioned that the uptake was good, including in the community setting. But at this 
point, it's hard to really look and see whether sites and we can't really see that sites are accumulating inventory or 
that there is pent-up demand or things like that. So, it's very hard to see that right now. This is important drug for a 
disease that didn't really have a lot of good therapy. And so, I think we're there and helping patients in a big way.
Chip, do you want to add anything to PADCEV that I didn't mention?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles (Chip) Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure, Clay. We generally don't see sites include significant inventory or accumulate significant inventory. This is 
kind of a just-in-time delivery model. So, generally when they're ordering, they have a patient. I think you're right 
in saying that this just represents an advancement I think for bladder cancer and that [ph] there wasn't (00:26:19) 
good treatment alternatives out in the marketplace.

Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question. And let me offer my congrats on the very incredible PADCEV 
launch as well, beating even a very bullish estimate despite a global pandemic ongoing, so huge, huge congrats 
there. So, as PADCEV has been discussed a little bit, so I was going to ask elsewhere. Was wondering what 
you're seeing around impact of ADCETRIS use due to the COVID pandemic. It seems like you might have been a 
little bit impacted in Q1 and maybe in March. And then also it seems like the tisotumab vedotin readout maybe got 
pushed back a little bit. Given this trial was fully enrolled, I'm wondering if we should be thinking that maybe that's

suggesting a longer progression-free survival response [indiscernible] (00:27:16) collection from some of these 
patients that are in that trial. Thanks so much and congrats again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thank you. So, with ADCETRIS, we're really excited about ADCETRIS and it's a great drug. It's helped tens of 
thousands of patients and continues to. The first time that this drug ever hit $1 billion in sales globally was last 
year. Sales have doubled over the past two years and [indiscernible] (00:27:45) from 2019, it was 22% up. And 
the first quarter is always a little bit light with ADCETRIS and has been year in and year out. So, I'd look at the 
quarter [ph] over last year's (00:27:58) first quarter.
Now having said that, you did bring up COVID-19 and certainly it's something to look at, whether there's a small 
number of patients that are unable to come in and get therapies for lymphoma, it's something that very well could 
be happening. It's really hard to know exactly. But we're really excited about our five-year data coming out later 
this year. And it's something that we haven't changed our guidance for the year. So I think that that's really 
something important to look at.
Now you briefly snuck in a second question on TV about timing. The most important thing with our data with TV is 
this is potentially registrable. And we need to follow the data and follow the duration of the data and work with a 
third-party that puts these type of blinded data together and before we can present this and reveal the data. So, 
that's something that's ongoing. We're working hard at. If they may very well come this quarter, okay, we're 
working toward trying to make that happen. We just put out that it may slip a little bit into the third quarter, just in 
case it does, but we're working hard to get this done in the soonest timeframe possible. So, I wouldn't read too 
much into it and you'll hear about it soon.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hey. Thanks for taking my question. This is [ph] Turner (00:29:49) on for Cory. On TUKYSA, we've heard from a 
few docs that pharmacy copays could be a barrier to access for some patients just based on experience from 
other early administered products. What are your thoughts on this? And can you comment on some of the 
programs you're undertaking right now on this front? And then also on EV, I'm curious when we could expect data 
from the EV-103 study for patients that are [ph] platinum-eligible (00:30:12)? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A

Yeah I did. I did and thank you for the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Can you do that first and then we'll go back to the TUKYSA question with Chip.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. I can do that. So, the question was when will we expect data from the EV-103 trial that would lead to a 
potential approval in cisplatin-eligible frontline metastatic bladder cancer. And the answer is, we started the cohort 
in January, the total number enrolled is 150, it's a randomization versus PADCEV monotherapy to PADCEV plus 
KEYTRUDA. The enrollment is going as we expect. We can't reveal the timing of that. But just to point out, the 
response rate and duration of response are the two endpoints that we need. So, we understand once we're fully 
enrolled what that timing will look like, but we just can't reveal that at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. And Chip, can you comment on what [ph] Turner (00:31:30) had heard about TUKYSA and copay and any 
potential barrier? We work very hard to make that not happen. So, Chip, can you talk about our systems for doing 
that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles (Chip) Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure, Clay. Through our already established SeaGen Secure program, we will provide copay assistance for 
eligible commercially insured patients to help with in order to minimize out-of-pocket cost associated with the 
product.

Hey, all. This is Connor Meehan on for Matthew. Thanks for taking the question. So, just on PADCEV, can you 
elaborate a bit on your discussions with the FDA and the accelerated approval in the frontline? And I guess, how 
those conversations have been going and how they may impact the timeline there? And then just quickly on 
COVID and on the launch, what sort of penetration have you guys been seeing thus far? Thank you.

Connor Meehan
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Sure. Yeah. Sorry. It might be mine as well. So, could you just elaborate briefly on your discussions with the FDA 
regarding frontline accelerated approval for PADCEV? And I guess, just how those have been going and 
potentially timelines, if available? And then, could you just provide some comments around COVID and the impact 
that it had to the PADCEV launch and then what sort of penetration that you guys have seen during the first 
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. So, first of all, Roger just gave an update on the frontline work we're doing in the 150 patients for the 
accelerated PADCEV approach. And so, he explained the two arms in his prepared remarks, 75 patients each, it's 
150 patients. We started the enrollment in January. It's going well. We have not provided set timelines at this
point, but our interaction with the FDA was strong and we put out a press release on it. I think at the end of the 
day, we've done this a lot with different drugs. We have eight different approvals with drugs and labels. And I think 
we're pretty good at this and we know what we need to bring to the FDA. But at the end of the day, it's always a 
review decision. The FDA looks into data and makes a decision based on the data. So, we will work forward fast, 
we'll be prepared and we'll bring it to the FDA. And as we get further into the trial, we usually provide timelines, 
but not yet.
As far as COVID-19 and PADCEV, we can't rule out that there wasn't an impact on COVID-19. It's impossible to 
rule that out. We had two months in the field and then COVID-19 hit and our sales people switched to a virtual 
sales force, which actually helped train us to be fully ready for TUKYSA. We had two drugs getting approval four 
months apart. But the second drug, TUKYSA, is purely virtual as far as communications with doctors, et cetera, 
and caregivers. But with PADCEV, while we can't rule it out that it had impacts, we're very pleased with the $34 
million in net sales. It means we've gone out there and we've really got to a lot of patients. Doctors are using the 
drug. We hear really good things about it. We're certainly bullish on PADCEV going forward, not only in the 
relapsed setting like we have, but also in first-line and other settings. And we have not provided a market 
penetration number on this as of yet. These are things that we would decide in the future whether or not we would 
provide this type of guidance.

Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the TUKYSA launch here as well as PADCEV. Maybe 
just a couple for Roger on additional labeling opportunities. The EV-201 Cohort 2, can you just help us 
understand how big that incremental additional opportunity might be in bladder cancer? And then you mentioned 
the Merck collaboration for muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Can you just help us here what the potential 
path to market could look like?

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Roger, go on ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So, thanks for the question. So, as we've indicated, we've enrolled Cohort 2. Cohort 2 is this group of 
patients on the EV-201 trial who have not cisplatin-eligible, but have seen a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. That's a 
smaller population than the broader population, which are platinum-eligible and have seen a PD-1. Nevertheless, 
it's a high unmet need, it's a meaningful population. So, we are hopeful as the data matures and we're able to give 
you a little bit more guidance from timing, we've completed enrollment. This is, as is Cohort 1, as well as Cohort 1, 
it's an overall response followed by duration of response evaluation. So, we're hoping we'll get the results 
potentially later this year. But I think as we get more clarity on the timing, we'll give you more guidance.
With regard to muscle invasive bladder cancer, we're very pleased. As you know, we have two cohorts running in 
EV-103 – one looking at PADCEV monotherapy and the other looking at PADCEV together with KEYTRUDA in 
cisplatin-ineligible patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. And essentially by being able to join the Merck 
registrational trial, we've sort of leapfrogged our potential to get an approval in this very important group of 
patients. The endpoints are as defined by original negotiations between Merck and the FDA, focused on things 
like a pathologic complete response and event-free survival. I think the details of how that trial has been altered to 
accommodate PADCEV and KEYTRUDA will become available through CT.gov or some other means. And once 
they're available publicly, I think we'll go into more detail for you. But that is an ongoing trial which we are joining.

Q
Hi. This is [ph] Greg Harrison (38:54) on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question. Just to dig into the guidance a 
little more. The fact that you maintained it across the board definitely showed some confidence. So, just 
wondering what impact from COVID-19 is implied in your decision to maintain the guidance. And what sort of 
factors are in play, negative or positive, that give you confidence in that outlook both in terms of ADCETRIS as 
well as expenses and your other guidance items?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Well, I'll address the ADCETRIS and I'll let Todd address the expenses. So, ADCETRIS is a great product. 
It's been out there approved in 2011, we have six labels and helps patients in many different ways. So, doctors 
rely on it, depend on it and patients benefit from it. And I think that when we – COVID first comes out and came 
out on to the scene, it was really hard I think for some docs and patients to really know exactly what to do. We 
were all a little bit stunned by the changes that happened so rapidly. And so, I think that initially it was not as 
clear, but it is really important for these patients to continue getting therapy and when they need therapy for 
cancer getting therapy, it is really, really important. So I think that over time we've learned a little bit more and

learned how to stay safe and wear masks and do other things. And so, I think that right now cancer patients are 
getting therapy, which is really important for cancer patients with life-threatening disease. And we see that 
strengthening and improving through the year. So I think staying with our guidance makes a lot of sense for us 
because there are patients that need therapy and we think that largely they're going to be getting their therapy.
Todd, do you want to talk about expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. I'll first maybe start off by saying that we have really as a management team tried to focus on this and keep 
business interruption to an absolute minimum. Clay is right. When you look at what we're doing commercially, 
what we're looking at from a clinical trial perspective, our trials to cancer patients are important, and we have 
really done the best we can to keep the level of disruption on our trials down. Now when you look at our R&D 
expenses in the first quarter, if you annualize that, we're a little bit below our annual guidance. But I would point 
out that we've got a whole bunch of trials that are sort of in ramp-up mode now and we're trying to keep that going 
as best we can. This includes the EV-301, the EV-302 and the EV-103 trials for EV, the TUKYSA combination trial 
with T-DM1, the MOUNTAINEER trial, the TV pivotal study. We've got a lot of potentially registration studies 
underway and we've really done the best we can to keep moving forward as fast as we can and still doing it 
responsibly.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chad Messer
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question and let me add my congratulations on a really strong first full quarter for 
PADCEV. I don't think we expected you to get to this run rate for another few quarters at least. My question is on 
nectin-4 expression. So, in urothelial cancer, you're not enrolling any of these studies based on that presumably 
because it's so ubiquitous. But are you collecting information on nectin-4 expression and looking to see how it 
correlates to response in any of the studies? And sort of where I'm going is maybe that becomes more important 
as you look outside of urothelial cancer to just some other indications where it's not quite so ubiquitous and kind 
of wondering how you are handling that in your basket trial. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yes. I'll make a quick comment and turn it over to Roger to talk about a lot of other factors. But very early on, we 
were looking – when this product started years ago in Phase 1, we had looked at H scores, which tells you how 
much nectin-4 there is, and response rate. Now keep in mind that H scores is kind of a crude way to determine 
level of nectin-4, it's not 100% precise, but it's pretty good and it's quick and it's readily available and it is 
ubiquitous in bladder cancer. And so, we found pretty early on that it was very hard to see a correlation between 
the H score for the histology to the response. So, in that regard, we do not need a diagnostic tool for it in the 
metastatic setting. And I'll let Roger speak from there about any other thing in the basket trial, et cetera.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. It's a great question. So, really for all of our ADCs, we look obviously for the highest expressing tumors and 
so the basket trial EV-202 has a group of cancers – breast, lung, head and neck, gastric cancer and so on, which 
has high nectin-4 expression. But we're always prepared. So, nectin-4 expression is always measured. And if it 
turned out that actually a biomarker was relevant potentially in selecting patients who would respond, I think we 
would be ready for that. Our supposition is that that will not be the case. There are components, for example, 
vedotin ADCs have bystander effect, so the drug can leak into a cell next door that doesn't mark with a particular 
biomarker. So, our going in premises, we will not need it, but we will be prepared if we do.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my questions. [indiscernible] (00:45:40) two parts of the question. First one is regarding the 
PADCEV. Just wondering the strong revenue for the first quarter, was the script mainly driven by academic 
doctors or was that by the community doctors? And my second question is regarding the IP arbitration process. 
Just wondering how long it will usually take and would there be multiple rounds of the process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, to first concerning PADCEV, we are not at this point planning to outline what percentage is in academic 
settings and what percentage is in community settings. I think in the prepared remark, Chip mentioned that a fair 
amount of the use is coming from community settings, which we're delighted with. So, right now, we see script 
coming out of both academic and community settings and we're very pleased with the uptake. And we look 
forward to having a great year of providing PADCEV to patients in need and to the doctors and supporting the 
doctors as they use PADCEV in patients that can really benefit from this exciting drug. So, that's something we're 
going to continue. Maybe in the future, we'll be in a position to discuss the academic and community settings, but 
it's entirely too soon to really speculate and think about that.
As far as the litigation, you believe you asked a question about what we meant, what we discussed with Daiichi 
Sankyo. Is that correct, Gena? Did you ask that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Yes. So, the arbitration process, just wondering how long will that take and also would that be multiple rounds. I 
know it's not the court process, but I'm just wondering would that be – is there like a certain timeframe should we 
expect the final results will be read out?

Okay. So, we are not guiding to any specific timeframe for that. I appreciate the question very much. We're 
pleased that the ruling was to go forward in arbitration. Keep in mind that the deal we did basically said that if 
there was an issue, like what has come up, that the correct approach and the right legal pathway forward based 
on the deal that we had with Daiichi Sankyo was to go through arbitration. And we believe that our case is very 
strong. We've mentioned this publicly before. We believe that they used our technology and they made 
improvements, which was completely spelled out in the agreement to the products they have. And we believe we 
are correct in bringing this case forward and protecting our IP as appropriate. So, we feel very strong about that. 
Going forward, in arbitration, it's a more efficient and rapid path forward to a resolution rather than bringing it to a 
court case and so we're very pleased that it is going through arbitration and that's now started. But other than 
that, it's a pending legal matter and we really can't make comments.

Joseph M. Catanzaro
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here and congrats on this nice PADCEV quarter. Just one question 
around it and maybe just to try and give us a sense of the trajectory moving forward. One thing we had heard 
even prior to COVID is that with PADCEV in the real world setting some physicians felt they had flexibility in how 
they dosed it, given it's dosed every three weeks out of four to balance efficacy with the tolerability. Just 
wondering if you're sort of seeing that and whether you expect that to maybe pick up in light of the current 
environment to sort of maybe minimize patient visits. Thanks. And any sense around duration of treatment, 
though, I realize it's early here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, Joe, we haven't really seen what you're talking about. I could turn it over to Roger to comment on this. But we 
haven't seen doctors flexing to some other schedule. I mean, we have our schedules three weeks on and one 
week of drug holiday, and that's our schedule. The duration also, we presented that with all of our data and so we 
have some firm data on duration that we're very proud of it and it's an exciting great drug. I mean, Roger, is there 
anything you want to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah, sure. So I think when you get into cancer medicine and a disease like bladder cancer, which is devastating, 
patients are very symptomatic, the demand to get the treatment per the plan is high. With the initial sort of 
onslaught of COVID, it may have taken some time for oncology clinics to work out how to manage through what a 
new schedule could look like and how to get patients treatment. So, most of the focus that I think we're aware of is 
that the clinic's focus on giving treatment, they may struggle with off-treatment visits and so on, but getting the 
treatment is paramount.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Thanks. And let me add my congrats on the strong launch. You guys beat the [ph] nHER2 (00:51:30) number and 
we thought that was a great launch yesterday. Just wanted to get some more color on PADCEV uses and it's 
really, I guess, one question to three parts. Should we think of the beat as being driven by more advanced 
patients than you'll eventually get? I mean, we've seen other launches that kind of [ph] roar (00:51:50) out of the 
gate and then the duration of usage for the early patients drops off because they're more advanced. Just trying to 
see if that can be the case here. And then, can you guys give us any color, are you seeing usage of PADCEV 
with KEYTRUDA. And then the last part is, are you getting patients that have the FGFR biomarker?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. So, thank you for your questions. And congratulations to you, I'm putting three questions into one, that's 
very innovative. So, as far as the advanced patients go, your comment on whether we see a lot of advanced 
patients and we'll see a falloff and all that stuff, that is not where we feel we are. We feel this is being used 
broadly and will continue to be used broadly. There is a lot of excitement for this drug going forward. And I think 
for anybody that has metastatic bladder cancer according to the label, and this treats anybody, whether you're 
advanced, more advanced or less advanced, keep in mind that most patients with bladder cancer to some extent 
are advanced. It's a bad disease. But whether they're earlier in that cycle or later in the cycle, all of them can 
benefit. And I really can't make comments that we're just seeing one type of patient. I don't think that's happening.
As far as the combination with KEYTRUDA, we loved our data. Our data was spectacular with that, which is why 
we started a global trial to look for frontline, which is also why we went to FDA early to say, is there an expedited 
pathway to get first-line in combination with KEYTRUDA. So we're doing both the full global trial as well as doing 
the expedited trial with PADCEV and as far as whether anybody is using PADCEV in combination with 
KEYTRUDA. We can't make any comments on. That's certainly not something that we're out there promoting for. 
We have clinical trials open right now I think that we're encouraging people to sign up for trials to do that.
And as far as the last question, FGF biomarker, we're very aware of that. It's not something that we're focused on, 
though. I mean, that's a small subsection of bladder cancer. There's no diagnostic tool. We can use everybody or 
we could treat everyone, I should say. And so, we're looking at really just helping out as many patients as we 
possibly can and working with the doctors that make their therapy decisions.

Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the PADCEV launch. Just a couple of quick ones. Was 
wondering maybe if you can just talk a little bit about [ph] CD30B (00:55:04) and in terms of what's being used 
there to drive the improved tolerability that was referenced in the opening remarks. Is that a more stable linker? Is 
that a different payload? And then just curious regarding your publication plans, if there's any in the works for the 
EV-103 data in terms of the preliminary results we've seen thus far. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. I'll answer the CD30C question and then Roger can opine on the EV-103 plans for publications, 
presentations, whatever. With CD30C, well, we decided that it was important to try to continue to innovate and 
continue to make as best of drugs as we can for cancer patients. And CD30 is a target we know a heck of a lot 
about. This is something that we have studied for years. I think we're one of the top companies if not the top 
company in the world thinking about CD30 and CD30 therapy. And so, I think that it's really important to think 
about, can you continue to get better and treat patients better. ADCETRIS is a phenomenal drug. But to try to 
improve outcomes for patients with CD30 malignancies is important for us.
So, we set out a few years ago to try to say, how can we make a drug that can even give patients even better 
outcomes than what's already a really good drug in ADCETRIS. And it was hard. I mean, we made a lot of 
different versions and just couldn't get any better than ADCETRIS for years, which tells you a lot about 
ADCETRIS and how good of a drug it is. So, with CD30C, what I would say is it's different. It has different linkers, 
different payloads, different ways it's going to work, different ways it could combine with things. So, in the 
laboratory setting and animal models of cancer we are really excited with it. In the clinic, whether this will prove to 
be better than ADCETRIS or different than ADCETRIS with different characteristics, we don't know yet, but we're 
excited to bring this forward and see how much we can work toward helping patients. So, that's really what that's 
about.
Roger, do you want to talk about EV-103 and plans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Yeah. So, it's a great question and it's under consideration because, as you know, the results were really 
quite remarkable and we think that it could potentially be worthy of a publication. But I don't think a final decision 
has been made, but obviously we'll update you if we make that call.

Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on PADCEV. It's fantastic to see. I actually have a question about 
ADCETRIS. And Clay, you mentioned that there's going to be some five-year follow-up data coming. Do you 
expect that's going to move the needle with practitioners? And if so, how do you see that?

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thank you for the question, George. It's a good question. When we started and got our first approval in frontline 
Hodgkin lymphoma, a lot of docs saw the data and they saw – it was two years' worth of data, and the data were 
strong. But they said, this is a disease we know how to treat for decades. They were using ABVD and they had a 
lot of data. And the docs remarked to us that the five-year data was the gold standard for this. And they really 
wanted to see the five-year data and really know what's the durable long-term and they called it cure rate. Now 
cure, I mean, we all die some day of something. But if you're five years out and you have no evidence of disease, 
doctors will talk to their patients and they say, you are disease-free, you are technically cured of your cancer 
because we have no evidence five years out. So, this is defined cure, for sure. But they've always said to us that 
the five-year number was a gold standard. And I think that for anybody that is still on the fence or not considering 
it, I think that the five-year data absolutely could be interesting, whether it will be a mad rush or something, we're 
not guiding to that, George. But I think it certainly could be important.
The other thing is especially during the COVID era we're living in, having a five-year data with a regimen without 
bleomycin, it's important. Bleomycin causes lung scarring and gives you respiratory distress. And for somebody to 
have Hodgkin lymphoma, which is in many circumstances a curable disease by the definition I said, to give them 
some pretty severe lung toxicity, I would not want the patient to have that and then be exposed to COVID 
because it could be much, much worse because of the lung scarring that you get and respiratory distress you get 
with bleomycin. So, having this alternative that not only is better, you have a higher rate of – we represented the 
four-year data – in the four-year data so far a higher rate of disease-free survival by around 6% to 7% over ABVD 
and without the lung scarring of bleomycin I think is an important thing to think about in this COVID era that we 
are working through. And having the five-year data would even be better.

George Farmer
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. (Broker) Q
Yeah. That makes sense. And then finally, can you talk a little bit about what the TUKYSA presentation will be 
discussing at ASCO in any more detail?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Well, we can't tell you the whole presentation because that's through the ASCO Virtual Meeting. But Roger, can 
you give a little foreshadowing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So, as the HER2CLIMB was designed and as it was presented, we focused on the main endpoints, which 
were progression-free survival and the overall survival and then progression-free survival in patients with brain 
metastases. But important questions – and that's the framework under which you understand the value and the 
benefit to patients. But important questions can still be answered by interrogating the data and focusing really on 
the outcome in the brain itself. And so, we've done those analyses and we've put together what we think is a 
coherent story to explain more clearly what the brain specific outcomes will look like, and that's what we hope will 
be a value to everyone when it gets presented at ASCO.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Andy Hsieh with William Blair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I hope everybody is staying safe and healthy and congratulations on a 
spectacular quarter. So, my question has to do with kind of the concurrent enrollment of the EV-103 cohort K and 
the pivotal EV-302, very similar patient population. Now, do you see kind of the enrollment tilt towards the cohort 
K, just given that you have both options which are chemotherapy-free versus EV-302 and therefore we should 
expect a really rapid enrollment timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, thanks for the question on the cohort K and the pivotal trial. Roger, can you explain what we're thinking of and 
looking there and geographies, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. And it's a great question. And so, to some degree, yes, cohort K would overlap with EV-302. But bear in 
mind, EV-302 is a very large trial that is we'll have a global footprint. EV-103 is more focused in places like the 
United States and there are more than enough patients to enroll both of those trials. So, it's what we do all day, 
which is to manage trial recruitment and to make sure that trials are adequately supported for both of them. So I 
don't have any concerns that we'll be able to enroll both trials expeditiously and that's what we plan to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Got it. Okay. And then, so it goes without saying that the company has executed to perfection in the past two 
years. And so, it's welcoming to see in the presentation you have some early-stage assets highlighted. Just 
curious, Clay, any assets heading into ASCO that you are particularly excited. And just curious on your thoughts 
on the progress made in the SEA, sugar-engineered platform and the CD40 asset that could be immunepotentiating.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So, thank you very much for your remarks on how well the company has done over the last few years. 
We're focused on cancer patients and we've been working really hard to help cancer patients, get drugs 
approved. Even during the COVID time, we have kind of rearranged the company for efficiency and people that 
can work from home are working from home and we have even started to reopen under very strict guidelines our 
laboratories where we have social distancing and people with masks and gloves. But they're back in the 
laboratories working and our goal is to really work hard and execute well to make a difference in cancer patients' 
lives. And so, we're trying to make the right decisions and focusing on that.
Now to your question on early-stage assets, you bring up the SEA40 program, that is a very exciting drug that 
we're developing and you'll hear more data about that in the future. Right now, I don't want to disclose any data. 
It's not ready to be disclosed. We'll disclose it at the right time. But it's an exciting program. It's a non-ADC. We're 
doing more and more with non-ADCs plus adding more ADCs. I think we mentioned that in the prepared remarks 
that there's both ADCs and non-ADCs and certainly our last approval in TUKYSA is a non-ADC – it's our first non-

ADC approved. And so, we're excited to make a difference to cancer patients in any way. We work on targeted 
therapies, whether they're targeted to cell surface or inside the cell. I think that our early-stage assets are very 
exciting. We have quite a lot of assets and we don't talk about them too much until we have some real data to 
show. But I think over the next year or two, you're going to hear a lot about our early assets, and I'm excited about 
them.

Operator: We will take our next question from Silvan Tuerkcan with Oppenheimer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Silvan Tuerkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thanks. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I have a question on the PADCEV 
development and muscle invasive setting. Since your clinical development moves so fast, I just want to make sure 
I don't lose track here. So, first, would EV-103 and the amended Phase 3 now be enough to file? And second of 
all, I think there is a pretty big deal that Merck amends an ongoing Phase 3 to include PADCEV even prior to 
seeing the EV-103 data. Could you give a little bit more color on how did this happen and does it mean that Merck 
will use the combo as potentially a new standard of care in the setting here [indiscernible] (01:07:58)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Well, first of all, thank you for your very insightful question about this and we really can't comment on Merck and 
what their thoughts are and whatever. We can tell you what the trial is and what we're doing and we're attempting 
to do and why we're going after this. And Roger, maybe you could give a little color on muscle invasive bladder 
cancer and why this is important. But I'm sorry, I just can't comment and we can't comment on what Merck or any 
company is thinking at this time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. Sure. So, again, it's a great question. And I think the excitement around combining an ADC with a vedotin 
warhead, which has been shown to not only kill cancer cells and kill them well in bladder cancer, but also set up 
an immunogenic cell death environment that is potentially – that could help a PD-1 inhibitor with an improved 
immune response. So, combining those two and the data that we generated out of EV-103 with the cis-ineligible 
frontline, I think, gives us conviction that we should take this combination forward as appropriate. And of course, 
we are still executing a small cohort in EV-103. But the opportunity to join an already established registrational 
trial and taking this combination together into a muscle invasive setting we think is really opportune for us.
And nectin-4 expression is consistent across all of the stages of bladder cancer, all the way from advanced 
metastatic disease back into the non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and in muscle invasive bladder cancer. So, 
there's no reason to believe that somehow PADCEV will behave differently in this disease setting. Merck has 
already generated data with pembrolizumab which – with KEYTRUDA, which is pretty exciting. But taking these 
two active agents and combining them in this population for which really there is no therapy apart from 
cystectomy we think is an important potential step forward.

OCTOBER 02, 2018 / 11:45AM, PEP - Q3 2018 PepsiCo Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
This conference call includes forward-looking statements, including statements regarding 2018 guidance based on currently available information.
Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted.
Statements made on this conference call should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's
earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
When discussing our financial results on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items such as the impact
of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other tax-related items, foreign exchange translation and acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other
changes from our reported results. You should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors
section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.
Now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us.
As most of you know, we announced in August that I'm stepping down as CEO of PepsiCo after 12 years in the role effective tomorrow. And so
today will be my final conference call with you, actually my 75th and final if you also include the calls I participated in as CFO.
After we complete the primary business at hand, reviewing the results and outlook and taking your questions, I'd like to ask for your patience and
allow me to make a few concluding remarks at the end of the call.
So moving on to business.
For the quarter, we generated $16.5 billion of net revenue, driven by 4.9% organic revenue growth, and delivered core earnings per share of $1.59,
a 9% increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter.
The organic revenue growth represents another quarter of sequential acceleration and the highest rate of organic revenue growth in 12 quarters.
The majority of our businesses again performed well, with particularly strong performances by our international sectors and solid performance by
Frito-Lay North America. And while North American Beverages profit performance was impacted by inflation and a double-digit increase in
advertising expense, the sector posted 2.5% organic revenue growth with a good balance between volume growth and net price realization.
Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization, driven by strong innovation and brand marketing. For example,
in June, we launched Stacy's Cheese Petites. Inspired by French cheese puffs, these bite-sized cheese snacks have real cheese baked inside, creating
a sophisticated snacking experience. In fact, cheese is the primary ingredient. Petites are a good source of calcium and have 6 grams of protein per
serving. And they come in a resealable pouch, making them great for a convenient on-the-go experience.
Over the summer, Doritos and Mountain Dew partnered on our Worlds Collide program to appeal to our Gen Z consumers who thrive on exhilarating
experiences. The program highlighted the brand's recent innovations, Doritos Blaze and Dew Ice, and rewarded consumers who purchased both
products with merchandise and experiences. The 8-week media campaign supporting the program spanned social media channels. It was also
featured on Pandora to reach our consumers' distinctive music.
Tostitos' growth was fueled by new products such as Roasted Red Pepper and Black Bean & Garlic. To support the product launches, we created a
program to drive trial during the summer get-togethers. Our [Buy, Ride], Get Together Already program allowed consumers to scan a code of
specially marked bags to redeem a $5 Lyft credit, making it even easier for our consumers to get safety to and from summer parties.
And Cheetos benefited from the launch of Cheetos FLAMIN' HOT Chipotle Ranch earlier this year, appealing to consumers' growing desire for
intense flavors. Cheetos further benefited from a Cheetos Museum Win What You See campaign, with our first-ever Cheetos promotion supported
by TV commercials directing consumers to WinWhatYouSee.com, where we invited our fans to find and submit unique Cheeto shapes to have a

chance to win what they see. We garnered more than 80,000 submissions, and the program has now been localized and rolled across 7 additional
countries and counting.
Turning to North American Beverages. While the marketplace remains highly competitive, we are encouraged by improving overall category growth
trends and a generally rational pricing environment. We had another quarter of sequential organic revenue performance improvement. Organic
revenue growth of 2.5% is the best we have seen at NAB in 8 quarters and was driven by retail sales growth in Starbucks Ready-to-Drink coffee,
Lipton ready-to-drink tea, Gatorade, our water portfolio, Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Certainly, strong innovation across the portfolio is contributing
to the improving performance. For example, LIFEWTR continues its journey advancing and showcasing sources of creativity with the launch of our
Series 6 bottles themed Diversity in Design. LIFEWTR achieved more than $150 million in measured retail sales in 2017, which was its introductory
year. And it's on pace to achieve more than $200 million in measured retail sales in 2018.
bubly, our new flavored sparkling water that has no artificial flavors, colors or calories, which we launched in February of this year, continues to
perform exceedingly well and is projected to exceed $100 million in measured retail sales in its first year.
Mountain Dew's performance is benefiting from the launch of Mountain Dew Ice, another launch which should surpass $100 million of retail in its
first year from launch, and from the return of Mountain Dew Baja Blast as our summer limited-time offering.
And in June, we launched Gatorade Zero. With zero sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade Thirst Quencher, Gatorade Zero is providing hydration
options for more athletes in more locations and is off to a strong start. And we believe our stepped-up advertising and marketing, particularly on
trademarks Pepsi and Mountain Dew, are also starting to contribute to improved performance as we saw sequential net revenue acceleration in
both trademarks in the third quarter.
Commodity inflation, operating cost inflation, particularly in transportation costs, product mix and a stepped-up advertising expense each pressured
our profit performance in the quarter. However, we expect that our recently implemented pricing actions will improve profit performance in the
coming quarter.
At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fifth consecutive quarter of market share gains, supported by a marketing
campaign highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal and innovation like SIMPLE & WHOLESOME organic hot cereal, a multigrain hot cereal
with no artificial colors or preservatives. In addition, Quaker lite snacks gained market share with high single-digit retail sales growth. And our Aunt
Jemima pancake business grew retail sales for the eighth consecutive quarter.
And to close out our conversation on North America, we are pleased to report that in the third quarter, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to food
and beverage growth at retail in the United States.
Turning to our sectors outside of North America. We are extremely pleased with the 10% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing and
emerging markets as a group, which is a continuation of the strength we experienced across many of these markets in the first half. Strong
marketplace execution led to continued solid growth across many of our key international markets.
Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 10%, driven by high single-digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina, Brazil and
Colombia. The LatAm team is doing an excellent job building our business and growing our market share in key countries in the region.
In our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa sector, Russia and South Africa each grew organic revenue high single digits, while Turkey and Poland had
double-digit organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the U.K.
and France, again continued good performance from this team.
And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, Saudi Arabia, India and Egypt, and high single-digit organic revenue
growth in Australia. Excellent results from our AMENA team. This strong top line performance translated into impressive bottom line results, with
core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our international divisions as a group.

The international results reflect our initiatives to continue to expand distribution of our big global brands and to innovate in locally relevant ways.
For example, we continue to drive international growth of our Zero Sugar Pepsi Black and Pepsi Max trademarks with introductions of lime and
cherry flavors across Eastern Europe, lime in the Nordics and lime and vanilla flavors in the Philippines.
We're driving growth in Doritos internationally, whether through expansion to new markets like China, where the brand just celebrated its first
anniversary since launch, to innovation in existing markets like India, where we launched Doritos Heat Wave.
And the Quaker trademark continues its global expansion, from the launch of Quaker super foods in Mexico to our launches of Quaker Kids and
Quaker multigrain instant oatmeal platforms in China.
Finally, during the quarter, we reached an agreement to acquire SodaStream. As we said on the day of the initial announcement, we believe PepsiCo
SodaStream are an inspired match. Daniel Birnbaum and the rest of the SodaStream team have built an extraordinary company that is offering
consumers the ability to make great-tasting beverages while reducing the amount of waste generated. That focus is well aligned with Performance
with Purpose, our philosophy of making more nutritious products while limiting our environmental footprint. Together, we can advance our shared
vision of a healthier, more sustainable planet. SodaStream will also add to our growing water portfolio while accelerating our ability to offer
personalized in-home beverage solutions around the world. From breakthrough innovations like Drinkfinity to beverage dispensers like Spire for
foodservice and Aquafina water stations for colleges and universities, we are finding new ways to reach consumers beyond the bottle, and the
SodaStream acquisition is fully in line with that strategy.
As we previously announced, the acquisition was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The transaction is subject to a SodaStream
shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and consummation of the transaction is expected by January of
2019.
Net, we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of our international markets. In North America, Frito-Lay continues to perform
well, North American Beverages is making steady improvement, and our recently implemented pricing actions will help improve profit performance
in North America. And finally, we are excited about the new opportunities that the pending SodaStream acquisition represents.
With that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll just provide a quick update on the outlook, and then we'll move to your questions.
After considering our year-to-date performance and other factors, we have updated our guidance for 2018. Specifically, we now expect at least
3% organic revenue growth for the full year. We now expect our core effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. We continue to expect core
constant currency EPS growth of 9%. However, we now expect core earnings per share in U.S. dollar terms of $5.65, which reflects a 1-point headwind
from current exchange translation based on current market consensus rates due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This is an 8% increase
compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.
We continue to expect strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For 2018, we
continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations, including a
$1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, and we now expect net capital spending of approximately $3.3 billion.
We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15%
increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following items to consider for the fourth quarter. Frito-Lay North America is lapping
5% organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect operating profit to decline in our AMENA division as we lap strong results
and a refranchising gain in Jordan from the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic,

Hungary and Slovakia business operations to benefit ESSA operating profit in the fourth quarter. And finally, based on market consensus forecast,
we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating profit by approximately 3 percentage points in the
fourth quarter.
With that, operator, we're ready to take the first question.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
Congratulations, Indra, on an illustrious career at Pepsi, and best wishes for you in the future.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thank you.
Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
So the quarter itself clearly saw a large acceleration of your organic sales in emerging and developing markets. That's in contrast to some of the
fears out there over slowing macros. So I was just hoping you could give us more detail there on what drove the sequential improvement. Do you
think it's more category growth accelerating or Pepsi market share picking up? Maybe some of the key countries behind that. And then most
importantly, just are those drivers sustainable as you look going forward beyond Q3 as you think about the strength in the business in the quarter?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Dara. So from an international perspective, I think we saw remarkably broad-based results. The list of countries that had a strong quarter is
probably too long to enumerate on the call. We'll use up our entire time doing that. Maybe most notably, I think we saw strong volume growth
both in snacks and in beverages. Snacks were somewhere between 4% and 5% volume growth, beverages between 3% and 4%. And I think it really
does sort of demonstrate the -- both the power of the portfolio and then, in addition to that, the relatively broad-based strength of economic
performance around the world. So I think we do expect international to continue to perform very well. I think the portfolio is sturdy and well
insulated. Look, at any given time, as countries are disrupted, we always have some exposure to those disruptions. But by and large, I think we
have a remarkably powerful international business.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
And our execution also picked up quite a bit.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jeffries.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
And I want to extend my congratulations as well. Can we start on the North America Beverages business? Results improving, so congratulations
on that. But coming at a cost when we look at the margin pressure year-over-year and understanding that freight and commodities are pulling
apart. But you're also picking up your advertising and marketing spending. So maybe you could touch on the ROI on the spend, if you're satisfied
at this point. And then, two, maybe touch on the necessity to maintain higher levels here into Q4 and even next year, particularly behind CSDs and
sports drinks as we look at some of the market share trends we see in the Nielsen data, in order to maintain this level of growth.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, it's Hugh Johnston. A couple of things on that. You're right, the P&L was negatively impacted by 2 things. Number one was cost pressure. Both
transport costs and aluminum were up. Number two was the increase in advertising and marketing spend across a number of our businesses.
Maybe just we'll step back a little bit in terms of the way that we think about advertising and spending levels. Our intention, generally speaking, is
to be competitive on advertising and spending levels but not to accelerate beyond competition. Our goal is to win based on the quality of our
advertising and the execution that follows that advertising rather than the level itself. So I think we will maintain levels of spending that are
competitive but not beyond competitive. Regarding the input cost inflation, whether it's transport or whether it's aluminum, our history has always
been to price through inflation in our developed markets. We'll look to do that here. We did that post Q3. It's fairly unusual to take pricing in the
middle of the summer. So despite the fact that we felt some of that pressure in the summer, we didn't take pricing until September. I think you will
see the profit picture improve in Q4 as a result of that pricing.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
And Indra, really I just want to wish you the best going forward. It's been a pleasure the last 20 years covering you.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
I guess the bigger question I would have is just as you're looking at the business today or in this year, right, we've seen some increase in investment
for advertising and marketing. We've also seen SodaStream as a, relative to some of the acquisitions you've done in the past, a little bit bigger,
which sort of suggests that there's just more of a need to sort of invest to continue to drive the top line. So I guess, Indra, if you could just sort of

address this. Are we at a point now where there's just a need to spend more, whether it's operating expense or M&A, to sort of drive the top line?
Or was this year sort of more of an anomaly?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, it's Hugh. Those are 2 fairly different points, so let me address them separately. In terms of capital allocation broadly, no change in policy here.
We've talked about $500 million a year in tuck-ins, that, that continues to be our stated policy. SodaStream, in a lot of ways, is a unique asset in
that it gets into a completely different market that we really weren't touching at all, which are consumers who prefer to prepare beverages at home,
whether they be just sparkling water or whether they be flavored beverages. So I would view that one as a unique opportunity that -- than trend.
Regarding is the cost of doing business going up more broadly, particularly in terms of driving top line, I actually don't think so. I wouldn't interpret
our increase in advertising and marketing in the beverage business as anything more than a response to a competitive increase. And that's a
competitive increase that remains to be seen as to where it goes in the future. I think our expectation, as we've said before, is we want to compete
on execution, we want to compete on the quality of innovation and we want to compete on the quality of our marketing. And we think we're well
positioned to do that, particularly with our integrated system.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - SVP and Senior Analyst
First, Indra, very sorry to see you go. You've really transformed the company and, frankly, the whole industry, so you feel very good about yourself.
Would love to hear what made you decide to go after 12 great years. And maybe that'll be in the closing remarks, but we'd love to hear that an
hour later. And then more specifically about the quarter, clearly top line has been very good. The margin has seen a little bit of pressure, and we
understand both the advertising increases as well as some of the commodity and other costs that are in there. But historically, you've been able
to insulate a lot of that through the $1 billion-a-year cost savings plan that we've seen here. Where do you think you are on that? Are you towards
the end of that and that's why we're seeing a little bit more pressure on the margins? Or do you think that has legs to continue for many more years
and continue to insulate you guys from what we're seeing, for example, this quarter and the most recent quarters on margin pressure?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Ali, why don't I handle your second question first? In terms of productivity going forward, the bucket which we drive productivity we call operating
expense is about a $28 billion bucket. It's got a natural rate of inflation of about 3% to 4% partly because the bucket is more tilted internationally
where inflation rates are higher. So I do think we've got years and years of productivity to come in the future. I'm not here to announce a specific
new program right now beyond what we've announced, but I do we think have lots of opportunity out there for further productivity. Regarding
your question on whether we can continue to drive growth through the P&L funded by productivity, I think broadly, the answer to that is yes. In a
lot of ways, I think that the third quarter was reflective of the timing of our pricing decisions, where we decided to take those post Q3 rather during
the quarter, which obviously pressured margins a little bit. And it was also reflective of continued investments that we're making in top line growth
initiatives, whether it's advertising and marketing, which was up about 6% in the quarter, R&D spending was up about 22% in the quarter, e-commerce
spending was roughly double in the quarter. So I think in many ways, what you saw was a timing issue in terms of the timing of commodity increases
versus the pricing increase and continued investment in the business while delivering the short-term performance that, frankly, in many ways, has
been emblematic of Indra's entire 12 years running the company and -- or posture in doing so over the last 20 or more years with the company.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Ali, and I'll answer your first question in my closing comments for sure.

And so I guess, first, on the guidance, Hugh. So the FX obviously came down by about 1%. The core EPS didn't change. The revenue went up. The
tax rate came down. So maybe there's a little bit of a additional pressure kind of between those lines, so maybe a little bit color there. And then
just follow-up on NAB pricing. So Q3 -- post Q3, the price increase. Can you just give us a little bit color, just the magnitude of the price increases
and the categories that you announced the price increases and what you think the elasticity might be in terms of the pricing impact?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So in terms of the point that you made regarding the P&L, we've said all along to the degree that we have upsides from tax and things like
that, we intend to deliver our guidance and invest back in the business. You just heard me articulate a few of the areas that we've been investing
in. Regarding pricing in the marketplace, the -- what we said broadly is the pricing will be somewhere in the low to mid-single digits, and that
pricing is basically in right now in the beverage business.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Indra, I was hoping to just take this opportunity to ask you kind of as you look forward and you think about what are the biggest opportunities you
think that are still ahead for PepsiCo, what do you think some of the biggest challenges are? There's a lot that has been built under your watch, the
continued development, for example, of DSD in the U.S., and yet we've got the dramatic changes in retail. So if you can just give us some thoughts
on kind of opportunities but then also some of the challenges and adjustments that might need to be made in the business model going forward
as you set to your retirement from the company.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thanks, Lauren. And I think PepsiCo has the scale and scope to remain one of the most successful food and beverage companies well into the
future. I think over the years, we've assembled a portfolio that is very synergistic, has tremendous growth potential. And more importantly, we
built out a geographic footprint which is quite impressive. Going forward, I think there's still tremendous amount of growth available in emerging
markets. I think there's growth available in rethinking some of our businesses as platforms rather than just products. For example, we still haven't
fully exploited how snacks can be mini meals and what we can do with the combination of our snacks and dips. And that's something our teams
are looking at very seriously. How do we look at sports beverages more as a holistic sports -- nutritional sports fuel platform? And our teams are
looking at that. And so our growth prospects, whether it's the developed markets or the developing markets and emerging markets, is actually
what we imagine it to be, not necessarily what the reported numbers are. So that's the first top line opportunity. I think the wonderful thing about
PepsiCo is that we reinvent ourselves constantly, whether it's rethinking innovation and top line, new capabilities we need to invest behind or if
it's rethinking the cost structure. As I've said to many of you, I think there's lots of technology-driven disruptions that are coming down the pike
that are going to force us to rethink many, many parts of our cost structure. But we started that work several years ago. And I think over the next

year or so, you'll start seeing a lot of these taking root. And how we implement these in the company and reshape our cost structure for the new
realities is really going to separate the great companies from the not-so-great companies. And I'm confident PepsiCo is among the great companies,
and we will reshape our cost structure using technology as a big driver. And I think we'll also use data analytics and insights to think about innovation
a whole lot differently. So I feel good about where we are. We've made a lot of the investments. The trick now is to keep investing in the company
judiciously so that we deliver a good balance of short-term results and make investments to keep this engine going into the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Lee Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Beverage & Tobacco Analyst
And congratulations anew, Indra. We all wish you really the very best in the future. I had a quick question on your guidance. Your outlook for organic
sales is now slightly higher for the year, but it implies a sequential deceleration in Q4. So could you guys first reconcile that for us? And then whether
you're being conservative or is there something else going on? And then I was also hoping you'd share an update on your current thinking on the
strategic options you're exploring for your beverage business in North America. Guess I'm wondering if you guys have made any more progress
in determining the right path for this business. And really what your latest thoughts are on potential benefits of refranchising.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, happy to jump in on that. Number one, I would remind you that the Q4 lap on revenue is more difficult than Q3 was. So while the guidance
does imply a sequential slowdown in Q4, some of our thinking is driven by that. And frankly, the guidance we've laid out there is at least 3%, so
we'll see how the quarter comes in. Regarding North America Beverages and refranchising, nothing new to report on that. We've said we look at
it as we always do. The one thing that I would say generally is, we do think the integrated system does make us more innovative. It does make us
faster to respond to customer needs. And it does make us more cost competitive. So those are the hurdles that we have to overcome if we were
to see some benefit through refranchising in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Caroline Shan Levy - Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst
Indra, congratulations. I really can't wait to see what you're up to next. And you've been a great role model for many women, so congratulations.
I just -- my question is on Frito-Lay North America, where the margin growth hasn't been as robust this year as it has historically. And I'm wondering
how you're thinking about the fourth quarter, which has a very difficult lap. I know you had some onetime payments in the first quarter on bonuses.
But is -- Frito has always been such a great driver of growth for the total company, Frito-Lay North America. Is there a point at which the margin
expansion story, thinking longer term, maybe needs to slow as you invest in new opportunities?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Caroline, it's Hugh. I think the answer to your question is no because we think that, that business is so strong in its ability to leverage new ideas
and new technology and to scale them relatively quickly to provide increased margin over time. In terms of the short-term numbers that you're
speaking to, one of the factors affecting Frito-Lay this year is transport cost. Now transport in Frito is more heavily internal relative to beverages,
which uses more common carrier. So beverages has been more exposed to the driver shortage and the impact in terms of transport cost. But
Frito-Lay is not immune to that as those use some common carrier. And there is some wage inflation in the driver pool as well. One of the things

and you'll see the margin performance return to a more normal margin improvement.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Faria Teixeira - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
And Indra, thank you for making history indeed. And best wishes for you and Ramon as well.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thank you.
Andrea Faria Teixeira - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
My question is related to NAB. Why are we encouraged to see the volumes return to positive, but the trends continue to decelerate on a 2-year
stack? So how should we think about volume performance on a sequential basis as you move through the fourth quarter? I'm assuming that you're
going to have some of the results of your increased investments and also execution at the trade.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Andrea, I'm not going to -- I don't want to go into guidance on a division through a specific perspective and -- on a division-specific quarterly
perspective, particularly not. I would view it as the business is both improving, but it's improving in a broad-based way. So watching volume alone
may not be as meaningful as watching the combination of volume and revenue, particularly in light of the fact that where we're seeing the best
growth is oftentimes in non-carbs and premium products, which are obviously, they move the needle less on volume but they move the needle
on revenue in a substantive way. So again, I think the message here in terms of North America Beverages is continued sequential improvement in
the overall business. The pricing will obviously help in Q4 as well. And we think we're getting that business back on track with the investments
behind advertising and the innovation that we have.

I guess I had a question on, I guess, the question that Bryan asked earlier on, SodaStream, but from a different perspective. If we step back and look
at what's happened over the course of this summer with the official creation of KDP with the alliance between Nestlé and Starbucks, with Coke
purchasing BODYARMOR and then Costa coffee and your own action with SodaStream. It just -- it feels like there's a tremendous amount of activity
and change all across beverages right now. I just -- I'd love your thoughts as to why there's so much activity right now. And what does it say about
the future of the LRB category and PepsiCo's role in it amidst all this change.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Go ahead.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Steve, I agree with you there is a large amount of activity right now, and you just cited a couple of competitors coming at it from a couple of
different angles. I don't want to speculate on their strategies. Now those are questions probably best asked of them. I do think you have people
using different approaches to reach for growth and to reconstruct their portfolios to some degree. From PepsiCo's perspective, by and large, we
like the construction of our portfolio right now. It's been built over the better part of the last 2 decades. And we think it's well positioned to compete,
well positioned to innovate on as we build on the platforms that have existed here for a long time. SodaStream, I wouldn't compare to the other
things that you cited. I think it's an exception to the rule because it actually gets into a market that we weren't playing in at all up until now and,
frankly, I don't think any of the other people that you mentioned are playing in, in a substantive way at all either. So I wouldn't compare our move
in SodaStream with some of the other competitive moves because I think it's driven by a new opportunity for us as opposed to getting into
categories that some of those folks already in, they just weren't scaled up at.

to nonalcoholic drinks?

I mean, really, I don't have anything to say. Now Hugh, I don't know if you want to add something there.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, I mean, obviously, we -- I think it's fair to say we look at everything. But I think the difficulties in investing in that category, particularly in the
U.S. where federally these things are still not legal, are quite a considerable challenge. So we look at everything but certainly no plans at this point
to do anything.

And very best wishes for you after the time in here. Two questions, if I may. One, Hugh, to your response on the NAB franchising and perfectly take
a (inaudible) there, I just want to look at it from when you look at your potential partners from a bottling side, is that also a consideration in your
decision to keep the current structure intact? And then second, as we look to the end of this year or next year, there is a ton of contribution from
below the line in terms of EPS. As you look at next year, how much room do you have in that below the lines in terms of flexibility? Or should we
expect operating profit to be generally in line with earnings growth next year?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Amit, happy to answer both of those. In terms of the potential bottling partners, we have a lot of high-quality bottlers in our business. So that's
not a factor in the decision. The factors are the ones that I mentioned earlier. Regarding your question on 2019, we're always quite disciplined

Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Pablo Ernesto Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst
All the best, Indra, all the best. Two quick questions, if I can. A bit forward thinking in terms of snacks. It seems to me that, yes, Frito is very strong
in salty. But a lot of innovation is more on the savory side, I would argue. We have seen a lot of the food companies coming into snacks. So just
help us frame how Pepsi fits in there. Because from my perspective, the company obviously protects its very strong salty franchise, and they're
obviously into adjacencies very lightly maybe perhaps not to dilute the core. But the market seems to be moving and shifting away from salty into
those other categories. So is that a concern? How should we think about that? And the second, very, very, very brief. Is there room for a closer
collaboration with Starbucks in the guise of coffee? I mean, obviously, Starbucks now is doing things with Nestlé overseas and in the U.S. Is there
room for Pepsi to do something with NESCAFÉ, for example? If you can comment on that.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, it's Hugh. Regarding Frito-Lay, I think we've continued to inch out of salty into savory really over the course of the past decade or more, whether
it's our Sabra joint venture or whether it's Stacy's. There's a lot of examples where we've gotten beyond salty and into savory. I think the good news
is the combination of our consumer insights, which are broad based around how people consume snacks, I think leads us into savory in a fairly
effective way. The reality of it is consumers don't think in these industrial terms like salty or savory. They think about occasions, and they think
about what they feel like eating. Frito-Lay's insights, I think, are extremely well positioned to pick the right areas to go and to develop the right
products to take advantage of those consumer opportunities. And then in addition to that, the scale of the Frito-Lay operation, once a decision is
made to enter a new subcategory, I think, allows us to be very, very successful very, very quickly, the scale being from the perspective of brands,
from the production systems, from the distribution systems. So I think you'll see Frito-Lay continue to be very successful in the savory area. Regarding
your second question around Starbucks, look, we've had the Starbucks partnership now for the better part of 20 years. It's been remarkably successful
for both of us. I think you'll continue to see us expand and build on the relationship with Starbucks.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.
Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Head of Global Beverages Research
Two questions, Indra. A little bit more big picture. First, a few years ago, you described -- and I think you were talking more about that the U.S.
consumer is somewhat confused on health and wellness issues in terms of how they were viewing sugar and artificial sweeteners. I think it was
probably 3 years ago. So I'd love to get an update in terms of your thinking about how the U.S. consumer is looking at the health and wellness
space and particularly with regards to sugar and artificial sweeteners. And then the other question is perhaps maybe give us a little bit more insight
into your successor. Obviously, he has done a fantastic job on the international front. But maybe a little bit of thought of kind of the things that he
has done in his past that could be very helpful with the rest of the organization.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Yes. So I'll just speak to the U.S. consumer. What we have been seeing over the past 3 years is that even though there's occasional confusion on
artificial sweeteners, Good-for-You or not, why not real sugar, what's wrong with high-fructose corn syrup, those kinds of questions, there is a
general trend towards health and wellness. Whether it's consumption of more 0-calorie flavored waters or drinking diet products or lower-calorie
products, there's definitely a trend towards whole grains, closer to nature. So that trend might vary in speed year-over-year, but the trend is there.
And as the millennials age, I think they're driving this trend more and more. And the availability of more healthy products, whether it's really ready,
prepared meals or home delivery of anything that's healthy, is actually taking away any barriers to buying a healthier product, whether it's Better
for You or Good-for-You products. So I think you're going to see an acceleration towards that trend as the years go by. Now Ramon is just an
outstanding executive, and you'll get a chance to get to know him over the next few weeks and months. The good thing is a lot of the trends we
are seeing in the U.S. have already happened in Europe, whether it's retail consolidation, whether it's trends towards health and wellness, competition
amongst all the European food and beverage companies, where warehouse-delivered products are really -- have to negotiate [hard] with the
retailers, all of those trends, Ramon is a veteran of. And he's going to bring all those skills to the United States. Second, as you know, over the last
year as President, Ramon has been leading the productivity program for the company, been leading innovation. So I think he's uniquely suited to
bring a fresh pair of eyes to everything we do here in North America while preserving his knowledge of the international markets. Finally, he's just
a good guy. I think you'll find his mix of operating expertise plus his ability to think about customers, consumers and bring the 2 together to be
refreshing. So get to know him. I think you will be very happy with what you see.

So maybe something you will occur in your closing remarks what will you have done differently should you have the opportunity to rewind time.
And then more in the business right now. I mean, your campaign, Pepsi Generations and increased A&M behind the brand are probably enough
to stabilize the brand Pepsi this year. Now good thing that the campaign was probably pleasing to boomers with some nostalgia retro back, but
I'm not sure it's attracting new consumer into the franchise. So could you please share with us, I mean, Pepsi-specific, I mean, brand KPIs, especially
as -- in regards to millennial consumers, please?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So as you might imagine, the KPIs on Pepsi are the ones that you would traditionally look at first at the highest-level market share performance
and velocities in the stores. From a consumer perspective, we tend to look at purchase intent regard relevance to consumers. A lot of this stuff is
done through survey work. And we have seen over time the metrics that we measure, while they may not be immediately responsive, they did
tend to prove out over time sales trends both positively and negatively. And the good news is what we are starting to see are, given the increases
in advertising, early green shoots of improvement in those performance metrics that, again, do over time tend to correlate with sales performance.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thank you all for your questions. Just let me make some closing comments.
After 12 years at the helm of the company, today is my final day as CEO. It ends my 24-year career as a PepsiCo Executive. I've been blessed to have
had the opportunity to lead such a great company and work with such incredible people, including our outstanding board, executives and other
associates, our customers and other partners, our shareholders and all our other stakeholders.
12 years is a long time as a CEO. And even though I have a lot of fuel still left in my tank, I wanted to do something different with my life, spend
more time with my family and give the next generation in PepsiCo a chance to lead this great company.
Throughout my tenure, however, we've strived to achieve a difficult balance between attending to short-term pressures while managing for the
long term. And I leave today proud of the work our team has done. We were pioneers in business sustainability and social responsibility and
embedded a sense of purpose in everything PepsiCo does, guided by our Performance with Purpose philosophy. We've transformed our product
portfolio by growing our Good-for-You and Better for You options from about 38% of revenue in 2006 to roughly 50% in 2017. We more than
doubled our investment in research and development to expand our more nutritious offerings and minimize our environmental impact. We became
an even more valued partner to our retail customers. We were selected as the #1 food and beverage supplier in the United States in the most recent
2017 Advantage Report and named Best-in-Class Manufacturer by Kantar for the second year in a row. We made positive contributions to communities

around the globe in which we operate through our support of access to clean drinking water, human rights, nutrition, agricultural programs and
many more initiatives. And we invested significantly in new capabilities in areas like design and e-commerce to better position our company for a
successful future.
In the midst of managing the business for the long term, we also delivered strong and consistent financial performance. Specifically, during the
period 2006 to 2017, net revenue grew more than 80%. We added a new billion-dollar brand almost every other year. We returned $79 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our market capitalization increased by $68 billion. Dividends per share nearly tripled from
$1.16 to $3.17. And we generated total shareholder return of 162%.
Finally and very importantly, we have been on Ethisphere's list of most ethical companies for the past 12 years.
For all of this, I'm grateful to my outstanding PepsiCo associates, who gave so much to PepsiCo and me over the past 12 years.
And now I'm handing the reins to Ramon Laguarta, who becomes PepsiCo's sixth CEO. Ramon is a terrific executive with a long and proven track
record of growing businesses. He has a deep understanding of the changing preferences of consumers and other critical trends unfolding around
the world, and he has demonstrated that he knows how to navigate them successfully. He has been a critical partner to me in running the company,
and I'm confident he will lead PepsiCo to new and greater heights in the years to come. The potential for PepsiCo is enormous.
Finally, I want to thank you, our investors and analysts. During my time as CEO and CFO, I've had a lot of spirited and fascinating conversations with
many of you. I've always valued your perspectives, even in those instances when we may have disagreed. You often challenged me, offered your
opinions and provide different perspectives. My interactions with you over the years helped make me a better executive and helped make PepsiCo
a better company. Thank you all for your time today and your engagement through the years, and thank you for the confidence you've placed in

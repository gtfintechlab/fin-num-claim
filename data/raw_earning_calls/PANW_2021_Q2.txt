Thank you, Karen. Hello, everyone. I know Walter Pritchard, you're listening in. Enjoy your last earnings call from 
the other side. Next quarter, Walter will join us at this end as our new Senior Vice President of Investor Relations 
and M&A Finance.
Well, moving on to the quarter, let me start with SolarStorm, which many of you are describing as one of the most 
serious and sophisticated cyber-attacks in history. The SolarStorm attack highlighted that enterprises need a 
comprehensive, up-to-date map of their full IT infrastructure environments, including understanding their own 
networks as well as external attack surfaces and supply chains.
In order for security teams to have an edge over the adverse adversaries, they need to embrace next-generation 
technologies that leverage AI, machine learning, and automation. To help our customers, we set up a Rapid 
Response Program. And when I say rapid, it was rapid. Our acquisitions of Expanse and Crypsis almost felt 
prescient. The teams swung into action. We updated XDR for all the new threat vectors. We offered free 
assessments from our Crypsis team. We also evaluated the attack surfaces from the outside in for Expanse and 
discovered that there were dozens of affected customers, including major government agencies and large 
companies, many of which were actively communicating with SolarStorm malware command and control 
infrastructure.
So far, we've received over 1,000 assessment requests and have completed over 500. We believe that the 
SolarStorm attack raises the mid and long-term criticality of the cybersecurity industry as a whole. This will result 
in more awareness and focus on cybersecurity, which in all candor, is the need of the hour given the complete 
reliance in technology in these times. We expect that this attack will be a wake-up call to all enterprises to 
modernize cybersecurity and will serve as a net incremental tailwind, not just for us but also for the industry.
Before I turn to our fiscal Q2 2021 results, I have an admission to make. Perhaps I was too cautious at the outset 
of the pandemic. The current sustained performance, resilience of our teams and execution has been turning 
more optimistic. We had a great second quarter with strong business momentum, as the organization executed 
across all platforms and strategies.
As a result, we beat Q2 guidance and consensus. Here are some highlights. We delivered billings of $1.2 billion, 
up 22% year-over-year, with strong growth across the board. Let me give you some additional context. Due to 
COVID, we have provided billing plans to a select number of impacted customers. When adjusting for these billing 
plans, our billings momentum would have been several percentage points stronger in Q2 than the reported 22% 
year-over-year growth. This trend has been in place and has been growing over the last few quarters. 
Consequently, our revenue growth is higher than billings growth and accelerated to 25%, reaching $1 billion for 
the first time ever, yes, our first $1 billion revenue quarter, with accelerating revenue growth. The strength has 
been across the board. And as we continue down the path of more and more of a subscription-based model, the 
revenue predictability will continue to rise.

Non-GAAP EPS was $1.55, up $0.36 from last year. The EPS expansion was driven by revenue growth and 
operating expense leverage. While there continues to be beneficial impacts due to lower travel due to COVID, we 
do continue to hire resources to support our product expansion, which we expect to continue.
Free cash flow margin for the quarter was 32.7%. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, we generated $838 million in 
free cash at a margin of 42.7%. We still expect free cash flow to normalize for the year around our full-year 
guidance due to some seasonality you see in the second half.
Last quarter, we started the dialogue around Network Security and Cloud & AI, and shared the P&L for both 
businesses. We received great feedback on the additional transparency, and we want to continue to drive more 
transparency to unlock shareholder value.
Let's first take a deep dive into the Network Security business, which we are calling NetSec. Our NetSec business 
is undergoing a transformation towards software and SaaS, making it more predictable and sustainable. Starting 
with our hardware firewall business and associated services, rather than building solutions only as hardware, we 
have chosen to offer security services and software subscriptions. Over the last two years, we have doubled our 
security subscriptions from four to eight, with the introduction of DNS, SD-WAN, IoT, and DLP. We're seeing great 
progress with DNS, which has acquired nearly 5,000 customers since launch.
These new subscriptions, along with the introduction of a higher tier support, Platinum Support, has allowed us to 
increase our next-generation firewall support and security subscription revenue as a percentage of nextgeneration firewall hardware revenue over the last few years. As you can see, we have sustained a 15% CAGR in 
hardware, subs and support. And our hardware contribution has gone from 39% to 29% in that time. To continue 
to drive software growth, we have made these subscriptions available across all form factors, Firewall FLEX and 
Prisma Access 2.0. We just recently completed the process of making it available on our product Prisma Access 
2.0, which is our firewall in the cloud.
Turning to our software firewalls, we continue to see a transformation to software form factors. With the 
introduction of advanced features, cloud-native integrations, and the development of the industry's first 
containerized next-generation firewall, we continue to see product/market fit. As a result, VM and CN-Series grew 
over 60% in the first half of FY 2021. We recently launched Firewall FLEX, another industry-first, a unique 
approach on how we offer virtual firewalls and CN Series to increase customer flexibility and enable a 
consumption model to drive additional growth. This new flexible consumption model features credit-based 
licensing that lets you consume VM and CN-Series firewalls, choose the number of CPUs needed, and add any or 
all of our eight security subscriptions, which is previously limited to five. We believe that by providing greater 
flexibility to our customers, we will continue to drive growth and achieve greater subscription attach rates.
To highlight how our software firewalls are transforming how customers approach security, we closed a deal with 
a leading telecommunications company to secure their 5G network. The transition to 5G is driving a number of 
very important architectural changes, including a highly distributed design, containers as a foundation, and 
security for enterprise customers as a critical business driver. We were first to deliver enterprise and service 
provider clouds 5G and container security. In doing so, we empower our customers to provide a secure 5G 
service to their customers and provide managed security offerings to their enterprise end customers.
Now let's talk about Prisma Access. When COVID dramatically changed how work gets done at companies 
across industries around the world, the needs for securing remote workforce have also changed. No longer is it 
sufficient to have partial access to applications, or what is sometimes called good-enough security. Overnight,

connectivity to every application was needed, security became business-critical, and user experience determined 
the difference between maintaining productivity or falling behind.
Even before COVID accelerated this change, we were already working on turning Prisma Access into an industryleading solution for enabling a secure remote workforce. What initially started as a GlobalProtect cloud service 
started to transform in 2019 with the launch of Prisma Access. In the last year and a half, we've built out industryleading capabilities. In that timeframe, Prisma Access has gone from less than 150 customers to now nearly 
1,000 customers and 30% of the Fortune 100.
Last week, we announced Prisma Access 2.0, the biggest update since introducing this service. Prisma Access is 
a full security platform in the cloud, with machine learning-based security, preventing unknown threats in line at 
light speed, a full firewall delivered as a service, and includes features like Zero Trust Network Access, Secure 
Web Gateway, CASB, DLP, and IoT security.
Prisma Access secures both web and non-web apps. As an example, conventional web security approach to 
cloud-delivered security misses 53% of all remote workforce threats that ride over non-web apps. Those threats 
cannot be ignored. And unlike alternative solutions in the market, we prevent them with Prisma Access. We have 
completely reimagined the way customers manage Prisma Access with an entirely new cloud-based UI that 
delivers better security outcomes through built-in security assessments. A new Digital Experience Management 
add-on provides native end-to-end visibility and insights to SASE and the ability to self-heal when digital 
experiences problems occur.
Prisma Access is built on a low latency and highly scalable infrastructure with Google Cloud as a backbone. 
Lastly, Prisma Access, along with the Prisma SD-WAN, our rebranded product from CloudGenix, delivers a 
complete SASE offering. With the recent addition of CloudBlades, we now have a SASE platform which allows for 
an API platform for seamless third-party service integration. Prisma Access securely enables access to all 
applications, delivers best-in-class security to meet enterprise security needs without compromise, and enables 
user experience that maintains or even improves worker productivity.
In Q2, we closed an eight-figure deal with a leading technology company with over 100,000 employees, with 
businesses in over 100 countries. As part of their digital transformation, the company was launching a new 
remote work initiative. In order to realize their vision, they needed a secure and optimized network that will 
support a flexible remote work environment. Palo Alto Networks was ultimately chosen ahead of several of our 
security peers, as the customer saw us as the only vendor that was offering a true SASE solution. Ultimately, 
Prisma Access was a key product given their goal to rapidly enable remote work, but the customer also 
purchased next-generation firewalls. VM-Series firewalls enhanced their SOAR capabilities through Cortex XDR 
and XSOAR. This was definitely a cross-platform deal to be proud of, and we look forward to a great partnership 
with the customer going forward.
Lastly, several of you have asked in the past about a software transition the associated economics. While the first 
phase of VM and Prisma Access purchases have mostly been incremental use cases, we've put together a few 
key examples on what we see in the market when a customer does choose to replace a hardware-based security 
solution with software or SaaS.
For use cases where VMs replace hardware firewalls, like this example of a local retail store running software 
firewalls and third-party hardware, along with other software applications, the estimate that the five-year revenue 
of this VM-Series deal is roughly equal with that of deals deploying a separate physical next-generation firewall.

For use cases where Prisma Access replaces hardware firewalls, we took a typical branch office use case and 
estimated that the five-year revenue of a Prisma Access deal is two times larger than a next-generation firewall 
deal. From a customer perspective, we estimate that the customer's total cost of ownership is generally reduced, 
as they move to virtual and cloud-delivered form factors. As you know, Prisma Access is only a year old, so our 
gross margins aren't as favorable as hardware, but we expect them to improve over time.
Now moving over and looking at our Cloud & AI business. We started this call by discussing SolarStorm, but didn't 
talk about our own experience with an attempted SolarStorm attack. Back in December, we shared with the 
broader security community that Cortex XDR instantly blocked a SolarStorm attempt on Palo Alto Networks, 
thanks to its behavioral threat protection capability. We continue to be bullish around the rapid pace of innovation 
that is going into our Cortex XDR product. In fact, Cortex XDR was recently recognized by AV-Comparatives as a 
strategic leader in their latest Endpoint Prevention and Response Evaluation, while still delivering lower total cost 
of ownership than several endpoint security peers.
Importantly last month, Cortex XDR and Data Lake achieved FedRAMP Moderate Authorization, which should 
make it a key piece of technology in the federal space. As further validation of our vision, we see more and more 
players in the endpoint security space rushing to jump on the XDR wave that we have established two years ago.
Overall, we continue to see the Cortex portfolio developing into the industry's first proactive security platform, and 
we see penetration into the largest companies continue to grow. 35% of Global 2000 and 66% of the Fortune 100 
are now Cortex customers, indicating that automation and advanced threat detection are top of mind for these 
customers.
In Q2, we closed a deal with a retailer. The company chose Cortex XDR to increase visibility, control and 
protection of the endpoints by adopting a more complete solution with XDR rather than using EDR. With Cortex 
XDR support for mobile, the customer is also able to easily extend Cortex XDR to additional devices leveraged 
on-site of their stores, signify the endpoint security policy across the entire enterprise. We then expanded the 
conversation to address their SOC's operational challenges by demonstrating how Cortex XSOAR's out-of-thebox preprocessing rules and alert deduping could reduce the alert volumes dramatically. With the combination of 
enhanced visibility, protection and control for their entire endpoint estate, coupled with automating and 
orchestrating alert volumes, the Cortex platform will have an immediate impact on this new customer.
Switching to Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud is building the most comprehensive and best-of-breed cloud-native 
security platform, and we continue to see strong customer interest. Prisma Cloud has now acquired over 2,000 
customers with 74% of the Fortune 100 and secures 2.5 billion cloud workloads. We also continue to see an 
increase in Prisma Cloud customers who are using both Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud 
Workload Protection for containers and services applications now at 50%.
Additionally, last month, Prisma Cloud also achieved FedRAMP Moderate Authorization along with Cortex XDR 
and Data Lake, as we said. This allows US government customers to leverage our visibility, compliance and 
governance capabilities for securing multi-cloud and GovCloud deployments.
The last deal I'd like to highlight is the largest Prisma Cloud deal that we've ever closed, an eight-figure deal with 
a leading SaaS company. Like many in the industry, they're moving from a private cloud environment to the public 
cloud. As part of this shift, they're moving to a containerized application architecture. The customer had unique 
scalability, availability, and vulnerability requirements for securing their containers across AWS, GCP and Azure 
clouds.

The maturity, the superior vulnerability detection of the container security capabilities, and the scalability of 
runtime protection of Prisma Cloud helped convince the customer to choose Prisma Cloud as their container 
security platform of choice. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Bridgecrew, an early pioneer of 
security for the development community.
The next big challenge we're taking on in cloud security is what is known as shift left security. Developers are 
playing an increasingly important role in cloud security, both in terms of what products are used and how they're 
operationalized.
Today, a single error in development can be replicated hundreds of times over, resulting in thousands of security 
alerts to be fixed. This drags down productivity and increases the likelihood of security issues in production 
applications. Shift left integrates security into the DevOps process to catch these issues upfront where they're 
easy and quick to fix. It's a win for developers and a win for security. Bridgecrew recognized the need for shift left 
security, and pioneered an approach to infrastructure as code designed for developers.
To engage the developer community, they released an open-source product called Checkov that was downloaded 
over 1 million times last year and have paid for product gaining early traction. When we bring Network Security 
and cloud AI together, we see tremendous synergies to power the platform of the Palo Alto Networks. When 
looking at our Global 2000 customers, we see that these customers are increasingly adopting Strata, Prisma and 
Cortex. 68% of our Global 2000 customers have purchased more than one platform, up from 62% a year ago and 
56% two years ago.
Given the momentum that we're seeing, we're raising guidance for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2021 and at the 
midpoint of guide, we expect total revenue growth of 22%, up 200 basis points from our prior guide. Total billings 
rose at 20%, up 100 basis points from our prior guide, slightly lower than our revenue raise due to the impact of 
billings plans as we discussed earlier.
We continue to expect next-generation security ARR at $1.15 billion, up 77% year-over-year. Product revenue flat 
year-over-year, unchanged from our prior guidance. Lastly, non-GAAP operating margin of 50 basis points. 
Adjusted free cash flow of 29%, unchanged from our prior guidance, as we continue to invest to capture the 
opportunities in the market.
Now, let's review our fiscal year projections for NetSec and ClaiSec. Overall, we are confirming our ClaiSec 
projections, while raising NetSec billing for 100 basis points and revenue by 200 basis points given the strong 
performance of SASE and VM-Series. Moving on to adjusted free cash flows, we expect Network Security will 
deliver a free cash flow margin of 41% in FY 2021, up from 38% in FY 2020. We expect Cloud and AI free cash 
flow margin of negative 43% in FY 2021, an improvement from negative 59% in 2020. As mentioned last quarter, 
for the next few years, we expect Cloud and AI to achieve gross, operating and free cash flow margins in line with 
industry benchmarks as we gain scale and our customer base matures and becomes more efficient.
As you can see, we have been able to dig deeper and align our resources further with our business areas of 
ClaiSec and NetSec. And as I noted earlier, there are tremendous synergies in the power of the platform at Palo 
Alto Networks. At the same time, we've also been increasing our focus on our software transformation and 
hardware firewalls, while building a new cloud and AI business. To continue this transformation and strengthen 
our financial profile, we feel that we can create more focus by aligning the teams around NetSec and ClaiSec. So, 
we're officially going from three speedboats of aligning our efforts around these two business areas with six 
focused efforts as speedboats in our next fiscal year.

NetSec. We're focused on driving this transformation from hardware to software, and delivering a best-of-breed 
hardware solution as required. As you saw, this transformation is actually financially neutral to net positive for us 
and always beneficial to our customers. The speedboats here will be firewalls, including virtual firewalls, SASE, 
and our growing security subscriptions.
ClaiSec, the business area where we drive cloud security, and our Cortex efforts have proven that with focus and 
an opportunistic, organic and inorganic strategy, we can create an industry-leading set of solutions for cloud 
security and solutions like XSOAR and XDR driven by AI and ML. Here, we need continued investment for us to 
drive customer scale and for us to continue to invest in both continued product development and customer 
adoption.
We'll do so by continuing our focus on Cortex, Prisma Cloud and Palo Alto Networks' Incident Response 
Services, a newly formed team combining Crypsis' Unit 42, which Wendi Whitmore has joined to help lead. We're 
also excited to announce that with the board's consent, we are finalizing the filing needed for an equity structure 
for the ClaiSec business. Our goal is to make sure the value of the ClaiSec business is more transparent.
In addition, the board approved the development of a vehicle for employees to invest in such ClaiSec equity, 
strengthening the alignment of shareholders and the interest of employees regarding the success for our ClaiSec 
business. Lastly, I'm also proud to say that Palo Alto Networks recently made a commitment to address climate 
change, which Luis will go over in more detail around how we will be carbon neutral by 2030.
With that, let me turn the call over to Luis.

Luis Visoso
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Nikesh. Climate change is an existential threat, and at Palo Alto Networks, we're all in to do our part to 
address this crisis. We have done some important work up to this point, including LEED certifications, recycling 
and community involvement. We plan to step up our efforts and contribute even more. I'm proud of our 
commitment to be carbon neutral by 2030. We have already activated renewable energy and high-quality carbon 
offset strategies. We will be reducing our emissions aligned to science-based targets, and we will work across our 
value chain to have lasting impact and advocate stewardship.
The Paris Agreement calls on all of us to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. We plan to reach 
our commitments by 2030. We will keep you informed of progress along the way. We will continue to participate in 
the Carbon Disclosure Project, and start sharing plans and progress using protocols set by the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
During the World Economic Forum's Davos Agenda last month, we committed to increase transparency by 
reporting on the International Business Council's Stakeholders Capitalism Metrics over time. It will take creativity, 
collaboration and visionary thinking to protect our planet, and we're up for the challenge. We call on others to join 
us, consider aligning to the Paris Agreement, and make your commitment to do your part.
Now turning to our financials. As Nikesh indicated, we had a great second quarter, and we continue to deliver 
winning innovation and adding new customers at a fast pace. This strength gives us confidence to raise our 
guidance for the year.
I would like to start with our performance in Firewall as a Platform, or FwaaP, which had a great quarter as we 
continue to grow faster than the market. FwaaP billings grew 21% in Q2, as we continue to transition from

hardware to software and SaaS form factors. As you can see, FwaaP billings declined 3% in Q2 2020. And over 
the last four quarters, we've been able to drive sustained execution and growth in this area to 21% in Q2 2021.
Next-Generation Security, or NGS, continues to expand and now represents a quarter of our total billings at $309 
million, growing 59% year-over-year. In Q2, we added over $120 million in new NGS ARR, reaching $840 million. 
Let me remind you, at our last Analyst Day in September of 2019, NGS was a gleam in our eye, and we called for 
$1.75 billion in billings by 2022. We're on track to beat those numbers.
In Q2, total revenue grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 27%, EMEA 
grew 24%, and APAC grew 14%. Q2 product revenue of $255 million increased 3% compared to the prior year. 
Q2 subscription revenue of $462 million increased 35%. Support revenue of $300 million increased 32%. In total, 
subscription and support revenue of $762 million increased 34% and accounted for 75% of total revenue. 
Excluding revenue from Crypsis and Expanse, subscription and support revenue increased 31%.
Turning to billings. Q2 total billings of $1.2 billion, net of acquired deferred revenue, increased 22%. Strength was 
broad-based as we continue to see strong execution across the company. The dollar-weighted contract duration 
for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter were slightly down year-over-year, but remained at 
approximately three years. For the first half of fiscal 2021, billings of $2.3 billion increased 21% year-over-year. 
Product billings were $495 million, up 3% and accounted for 22% of total billings. Subscription billings were $1.2 
billion, up 23%. Support billings were $733 million, up 34%.
Total deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $4.2 billion, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Remaining 
performance obligation or RPO was $4.6 billion, an increase of 41% year-over-year.
In addition to adding approximately 2,400 new customers in the quarter, we continue to increase our wallet share 
of existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of whom made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $59 
million in lifetime value through the end of fiscal Q2 2021, a 27% increase over the $46 million in the comparable 
prior year period.
Q2 gross margin was 75.3%, which was down 110 basis points compared to last year, mainly driven by a higher 
mix of our NGS products which are less mature. Q2 operating margin was 19.8%, an increase of 190 basis points 
year-over-year. The operating margin expansion is driven by operating expense leverage behind operational 
efficiencies, lower travel and event expenses due to COVID, which more than offset the incremental investment in 
headcounts. We ended the second quarter with 9,038 employees, including 176 from Expanse at the close of the 
acquisition.
On a GAAP basis, for the second quarter, net loss increased to $142 million, or $1.48 per basic and diluted share. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter increased 28% to $154 million, or $1.55 per diluted share. Our nonGAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 22%.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments 
of $4 billion. On December 4, 2020, our board of directors authorized an increase to our share repurchase 
program and extended the expiration date to December 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, $1 billion remained 
available for repurchases. Q2 cash flow from operations of $365 million increased by 19% year-over-year. Free 
cash flow was $332 million, up 29% at a margin of 32.7%. DSO was 60 days, an increase of three days from prior 
year period.

Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range 
of $1.22 to $1.24 billion, an increase of 20% to 22% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of 
$1.05 to $1.06 billion, an increase of 21% to 22% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 
$1.27 to $1.29, which incorporates net expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Bridgecrew, using 100 
million to 102 million shares.
Additionally, I'd like to provide some modeling points. We expect our Q3 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 
22%. CapEx in Q3 will be approximately $30 million to $35 million.
As Nikesh reviewed earlier, for the full fiscal year, we're again raising our guidance across most metrics. We 
expect billings to be in the range of $5.13 billion to $5.18 billion, an increase of 19% to 20% year-over-year. We 
expect Next-Generation Security ARR to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 77% year-over-year. We 
expect revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.20 billion, an increase of 22% to 23% year-over-year. We 
expect product revenue to be flat year-over-year. We expect operating margins to improve by 50 basis points 
year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.80 to $5.90, which incorporates net expenses 
related to the proposed acquisition of Bridgecrew using 99 million to 101 million shares. Regarding free cash flow 
for the full year, we expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 29%.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

In the interest of time, please limit Q&A to one question. Our first question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan 
Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And very nice quarter. I just wanted to dig in a little bit into 
SolarStorm and if you could talk to us about any impacts that you saw in this quarter. And more expansively, how 
do you expect the impacts of that event to play out as we go through the year? Is there more on the comm? And 
what parts of the product portfolio do you think are going to get most impacted by that event?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Hey, Keith. Thanks. Look, as we said in the call, we launched a series of initiatives to make sure that our 
customers are protected vis-à-vis SolarStorm. That was a sustained attack, which was planned over a series of 
quarters, if not years. And what we realized that once you get in the supply chain and start being able to spawn to 
18,000 customers, the impact is going to be far-reaching. What's happened is people were first reacting to that 
and starting to make sure, for an emergency basis, there's nothing in their infrastructure which is already infected 
and they have not effectively been compromised.
Now, with that slowly and steadily behind us, what's happening is we're noticing people doing cybersecurity 
assessment. Every board is out there saying, take a look at what we've got, make sure that there's no breaches, 
make sure that we won't be breached. First question was, are we breached? The answer was, no, we're fine.

Suddenly, [indiscernible] (00:33:37) wait a minute. Could we have been breached if we had SolarStorm? The 
answer is yes. So, what we're noticing is they're noticing a rethinking of the cybersecurity architectures.
In that context, our Crypsis acquisition was very helpful because that's where we had the field force to be able to 
go out and address these situations which kind of sort of came to light. And I don't know if you know Wendi 
Whitmore, ran IBM X-Force until now, and she's going to come join us. She's had a stint at CrowdStrike and 
FireEye and Mandiant as well. So, she's going to come drive that effort even more aggressively for us.
We also saw that in our own case, XDR protected us, which again becomes an important distinction for us 
because it was a zero-day attack and we found it because of behavior anomalies that were happening on the 
endpoint, which is effectively a key feature of XDR. So, we're seeing a lot more conversations around that. And 
Expanse's ability to be able to look at what assets are exposed to the outside which, in this case, with SolarStorm 
servers, were also useful, when Expanse went out and looked and saw that there were hundreds of customers 
with open SolarStorm server sitting on their network. So, it's generally been useful for us in the XDR part, the 
XSOAR part, the Crypsis part; but more importantly, from a board focused on cybersecurity hygiene, it's been 
critical.

Philip Winslow
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another fabulous quarter. Really want to focus in on 
Prisma Cloud and the VM and CN-Series. Obviously, you saw a massive uptick in the number of workloads that 
you protect in the cloud with Prisma Cloud and then obviously a massive uptake year-over-year, I think, more 
than 4x in terms of the number of firewall software customers. So, I guess kind of two related questions on here.
First, Nikesh, why are you hearing that customers are choosing Prisma Cloud? Obviously, signed the largest deal 
in that product's history this quarter. And then the follow-up to that, when we think about Prisma Cloud plus the 
success you're seeing in the VM and CN-Series, are those two combined kind of changing the customer dialogue 
that you're having as you're seeing these customers accelerate their shift to cloud?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Phil, thank you. Look, if you look at it, if you abstract yourself, we grew our firewall as a platform 21%, 
right? And we've been talking about trying to get that to the 15% range. You can see all that growth has come 
from firewall in the cloud, i.e. Prisma Access 2.0, and has come from our VM-Series, CN-Series firewalls. And it's 
kind of – it's hard to understand if you're not sitting with the customer. We have seen a few deals flip from

hardware to software in the last week, literally. Customers aim to buy a bunch of hardware and said, wait, hold on. 
You guys launched this Firewall FLEX, why don't we just go into this flexible credit program where we can spin up 
as many firewalls we want and spin them down if we don't need them, and they can carry those credits to the 
cloud? So, what do you – I think what is something very important to understand, we are going through a 
hardware-to-cloud transition now in the industry. It does not mean it's the demise of the hardware industry. It just 
means that the incremental shift is beginning to happen. It's gathering momentum. You can't keep posting tens of 
billions of dollars on billings for AWS, GCP and Azure and not see a decline in data center over time. It's going to 
happen.
So, if you look past the quarters, and in that transition, it becomes very important, how are you going to protect 
yourself in the future? So, we are beginning to see customers go from hardware to software. And honestly, we're 
encouraging it to the extent the customer wants our opinion. We have the ability to sell them hardware, the best in 
the industry, and the ability to sell them software firewalls, and the ability to sell them Prisma Access 2.0 in the 
cloud.
We're sitting now, as I'm saying, you pick the best architecture you want, we'll service it. You ask us, we'd rather 
you went down the software route. And that's when all of you guys start asking us, wait a minute, if you go to 
software, do you lose money? So, we put up a slide saying, look, we don't lose money. We make more money.
We want to say that not that loudly because that's not a good thing to say loudly. It's better security solution for 
the customer, reduce total cost of ownership, but we're seeing that transition. And I think that's the most important 
part of the story.
And as we highlighted, we did a big deal in the telecom space where suddenly security matters in 5G, right? 
Because in – no offense, when you and I walk around with our iPhones and Android devices, you got malware on 
them, tough luck, buddy. But if you're a car driving down the highway, and that can be infected malware, that's a 
problem. So, the 5G enterprise networks have to be secure. All 5G networks are being built in the cloud.

Honestly, there's no hidden meaning in there. We're not trying to tweak it in such a way that – look, we've seen 
strength in cloud firewall. We've seen phenomenal strength in Prisma Access. I have to tell you that this pandemic 
has forced the network conversation about how do I make sure Sterling can access every application at home, 
not just the ones that I let him access?
It's gone from a it's good to have remote access to you have to have remote access. And then the security 
suddenly start paying attention to network architecture. And then as – and Lee and his team have delivered this 
phenomenal next upgrade where we can look at both web-based and non-web-based apps. So, we're seeing 
phenomenal success. So, there's no tempering of our expectation and ambition on NGS. It's just how the math 
works right now.

Next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saket Kalia
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Okay. Great. Hey, thanks for taking my question here, guys. Nikesh, maybe for you. You touched on this in your 
prepared comments. Can you talk about the cloud and AI equity structure? What's the reason for setting up that 
structure now? And how is it going to work mechanically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief 
Executive Officer, Palo 
Alto Networks, Inc.
A
So, you know what, Saket, two-and-a-half years ago when I came here, we talked about building a cloud security 
business and we talked about building an AI-ML-based business. Last quarter, we started showing you the two 
pieces of NetSec and ClaiSec. You've seen that we're aspiring to get $735 million of ARR in cloud AI security. We 
also shared, on the left-hand side, our Network Security business actually has phenomenal cash flow margin, 
38% going to 41%. So, that's a cash-generative part of our business whilst we go through a hardware-to-software 
transformation.
On the right-hand side, we're competing with behemoths out there today, like the CrowdStrikes of the world and –
in the XDR space and a bunch of start-ups in the cloud space. That's an area for investment. We think that the 
market inherently values both those business fundamentally differently. It values the Network Security business 
and cash flow. It values the cloud AI business and ARR. So, we want to be able to create the opportunity for the 
market to value our businesses differently to create more transparency for the shareholders. And it also allows us 
to keep investing in the cloud AI business and in the interest of driving more ARR.
So, what we've done is, as you saw, we've separated our financials, showed you both NetSec and ClaiSec. Luis 
and team have worked hard to get them audited and make sure that we could keep reporting them on a more 
regular basis going into next fiscal year. And we are looking at various equity structures that allow us to create 
incentive plans, as well as potentially in the future monetize the ClaiSec business for a different set of investors 
compared to the old Palo Alto investor.

Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Fatima Boolani
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. My question is around the Firewall as a Platform business 
and the metrics there. Appreciate that deals sort of changed flavor in the eleventh hour, to your point, Nikesh. So, 
what are some of the core assumptions we should leave with around the installed base refresh opportunity as well 
as the R&D pipeline for hardware and appliance refreshes within the product portfolio on the Strata side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Well, Lee, do you want to talk about the hardware refresh plans? All I'm going to say is that we're not taking our 
pedal off the metal. We are going aggressively trying to continue to build the next generation of hardware and 
focus on refresh. I will tell you, in absolute dollars, we still sell the largest number of hardware firewalls in the 
industry. We get lost in percentages. It doesn't matter if other vendors are out there generating 18% growth, we 
still sell more absolute dollars of product in a quarter than everybody else. But Lee, can you talk about the 
hardware?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo 
Alto Networks, Inc.
A
Yeah. Yeah. Look, we're always working on the next generation of hardware since the beginning of the company 
until now. And we have some amazing new platforms coming. I won't tell you too much until they're out, but we're 
always working on that, really exciting stuff there, the software side as well with PAN-OS and new security 
capabilities, another set of amazing things we're working on.
One thing I'll point out in that, though, is the leverage we get across hardware, software and cloud delivered. Part 
of what really resonates with our customers is not that they get to pick which one they use from us, but their ability 
to actually use hardware where they need hardware, software form factors when they need software, cloud 
delivered where they need that with a set of consistent security capabilities, easy to manage and operationalize. 
That's something that only we can deliver to our customers.

rollout? How long has it been in market? And how much adoption is that in terms of the way it's impacting your 
model?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
I'll give you the preface of it, and Lee can jump in and give you the details. But look, when – we hadn't refreshed 
our VM pricing policy. It was set up more like a hardware business, where you had to tell us which particular 
model of software you wanted and you were basically stuck to that model. And if you think about software 
deployment, it's a key. I can give you a key with more capacity or key with lower capacity.
So, we just felt that we were being too pedantic in our approach and selling software in a very hardware-centric 
model, where you can only buy five subscriptions out of eight. So, we worked hard over the last 18 months to get 
this all done into a new credit-based model where you can right-size your requirements, so you can spin them up 
and spin them down. But if I say everything, then Lee doesn't get to say much.
So, Lee, explain [indiscernible] (00:44:17), Lee was saying, why do you say you're going to help – have me 
answer the second half of it when you don't stop. So, Lee, I've stopped.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo 
Alto Networks, Inc.
A
In my defense, like the – when we came up with the model, that was sort of, I call it, the normal model, and that's 
what others were doing. I'm actually – and our customers are very excited about this new Firewall FLEX model 
because it is the first of its kind in the industry, giving your customers the flexibilities, Nikesh was saying, to 
choose how many CPUs do they need, what subscriptions do they want, where they want to deploy it, cloud, onprem, et cetera? That level of flexibility and to do it in a credit model where each individual deployment can 
actually be different. So, we've actually – it's one of those unique cases where we've given the customer a lot 
more flexibility and options, yet made it simpler at the same time.
The last piece I'd address was in the old model, it was getting too cumbersome on how to offer all different 
security subscriptions. This model allowed us to easily scale up to all of the current security subs plus any future 
subscriptions we come out with.

Look, as I think all of you have seen and heard from us before, we used to set up this sort of either or approach; 
either it was next-gen firewall approach to security or is a proxy approach. And you've heard us talk a lot about 
the challenges associated with the proxy approach, limited application support, some of the challenges with 
applications and breakage and performance.
But at the same time, we recognized is there are certain use cases out there, where there is a right way to do it, 
and it is a – could be very complementary to what we do from a next-gen firewall perspective. And so with this 
release, we basically integrated that into Prisma Access, such that we can now give our customers the ultimate in 
flexibility on how they connect to the cloud through both a Secure Web Gateway model plus our next-gen firewall 
natively integrated, and provide all the great security capabilities we have.

So I think, Gray, what Lee is saying is we can [indiscernible] (00:47:27) proxies, now we also support proxies as 
part of our product. And we also support the app-based approach. So now you can go after web-based apps and 
non-web-based apps. And we said 53% of your breaches come from non-web-based apps, and proxies are used 
less than non-web-based apps. But we cover both – we cover both opportunities by doing it the proxy way or the

Patrick Colville
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Q
Hey there. Thank you for taking my question. Really appreciate it. Just want to ask about Bridgecrew. So, is that 
deployed on-prem, in the cloud? Who buys it? Is it the kind of developer buying it with the kind of credit card-type 
payment model? Or just help us understand that product better, please?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Look, again, I'll do the 1-2 punch here. But we've been making bets for the last 2.5 years where security is 
going in the cloud space especially, went from workflows, went to containers, went to microsegmentation, went to 
DLP, went to IAM. And what we kind of the realization is what's happening is there's a bunch of – so what 
happens is you do – you build an application as a developer and you give it to your IT team and they deploy it and 
say, hey, you silly guy, you've got a bunch of security bugs in it, go fix it, okay? So what's my security bugs? Why 
didn't you tell me before? They started going to open source and trying to find security monitoring software to see, 
let me just make sure I don't build stuff with security bugs in it.
So, what happens is what Bridgecrew has is such a – it's a open-source, free, no credit card needed, piece of 
software that starts tracking the security bugs in your development site, CI/CD site. So it tells the developer, 
you're making a mistake, fix it. Now what happens is you fix it, then you give it to the guy in security, the guy says, 
wait a minute, you still have bugs, so wait a minute. I checked it. So what we've done is we bought Bridgecrew. 
We'll take the open-source tools that they have. We'll look at the policies there. We'll map them with the policies in 
the enterprise side to make sure that if you need to find – if they're going to check for it in real time and in 
production, you get to check for it for free as a developer.
So, there's 26 million developers developing their seamless security structure. If we can get 26 million people to 
start checking it while they're building the application, building the software, then...

section, because you don't want it being checked against a different product set of policies. So we're going to 
merge that enterprise capability in Prisma Cloud because we already checked it, and we'll say, whatever your 
developers checked for free is what we're going to check in production, they're consistent, so if they didn't find a 
bug when they were writing the code, we're unlikely to find it when we're running it.

Tal Liani
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Hi, guys. I want to go back and ask about the legacy or the hardware piece. I'm trying to understand the 
competitive landscape now and trying to understand the customers' reaction to the fact the market is migrating 
somewhere else. Are there still competitive replacements, or is this a case where customers just keep the status 
quo, whatever they have today, because if they take a decision, it's going to be a decision to migrate out of 
hardware into more modern solutions? So, I'm trying to understand the dynamics, the underlying dynamics in the 
market, and from it to understand what's the competitive landscape like.

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, Tal, thanks for the question. Look, what's going to happen in my version of the world is you will still have 
40% to 50% of the customers who will still stick to a data center and a hardware-based strategy.
I think what the market has not fully embraced and understood is when you move to the cloud, the cloud can be 
expensive. And many companies will say, wait a minute, I don't need to do all this stuff in the cloud. I'm going to 
still keep a data center and do some of the less expensive stuff here, why do I want to take everything and make 
it real-time bleeding edge in the cloud? So you're going to end up in a hybrid world, where people are going to 
maintain data centers and maintain the cloud. So, I don't think every customer in the world is moving to the cloud, 
but I think that on the margin, yes, you're seeing a bigger shift to the cloud than you are [ph] people sticking out 
now (00:52:10).
So, with that fact in mind, we do see competitive replacements when customers have end-of-life for existing 
hardware installs, right? They're sitting there and saying, I'm coming to end-of-life for legacy vendor A, B, C, D, or 
E. Should I go replace this with new versions of legacy A, B, or C, or should I look at a new network architecture, 
which allows me flexibility of having hardware and software into more access. So the example we gave, we did a 
$20 million deal with a customer, who built – who bought Prisma Access for half of their employees, who bought 
hardware firewalls to the data centers, and who bought virtual firewalls to their cloud. And they make sure they 
were all consistent.
So, we do see customers end-of-life-ing legacy hardware, which is dead-ended, which doesn't have a software 
form factor or a firewall in the cloud capability, and we do see them transitioning to a hardware and software 
model. So it's not zero sum. It's not either or. It sometimes ends up being this and that.

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Thanks for the question. Look, it's not – first of all, we have spent the last six to eight months preparing for the 
financials visibility or transparency of ClaiSec and NetSec. It requires a lot of work on our accounting side, lots of 
rules to make sure how we do transfer pricing between the entities and how do we leverage our common sales 
force in Palo Alto Networks.
So – and again, we're not doing anything yet, all we'd have is we've presented to the board, and they have agreed 
that this is an area for us to go ahead and work further on, which means we are looking at seeing how can we 
make the ClaiSec equity more transparent, if we believe the market values that differently than Palo Alto equity. 
Now the market can say, this is great, we'll just love your Palo Alto equity, and we will help it achieve all the price 
targets, some of the more enthusiastic and optimistic ones that you have, in which case we may not have to do 
anything.
If not, we may actually go take a look at the ClaiSec equity and see how do we create more transparency, 
because fundamentally, if you look at it, you've got one business [indiscernible] (00:54:28) generating $1.5 billion 
of free cash flow, which is fantastic. We like it, 38% margin going to 41% whilst we're going through a hardware to 
software transition.
On the other hand, we have a $735 million ARR business growing at 77%. That business has negative cash 
flows. And the market looks at them together and values us one certain way, maybe the market will value us 
differently if we look at it differently. So we're just exploring the opportunity of being able to make that value more 
transparent. We're not going to change the operating structure of the company. We're going to still run it as one 
company with two basically agile business units, if that makes sense.

Hey. Good afternoon, everybody, and nice quarter. It was a really good quarter on firewall platform-as-a-service 
and you raised Network Security, but the product itself was just [indiscernible] (00:55:17) didn't raise it. So, what's 
the delta? What really raised that guidance on network for the year and drove the outperformance?

Access, VMs, and subscriptions. Not because subscriptions aren't doing well, it's just a very large number. So, 
sustaining a large number growing at 30% is a good thing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Turits
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets Q
Great. So it's really – Prisma Access was the big driver.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. I mean, look at Access, it's gone to a – when I joined, it was called GlobalProtect Cloud Service, we barely 
did $10 million in a quarter. Now it's going gangbusters. Now I just said we did $20 million deal across a 
customer's entire enterprise, which included Cortex and Prisma Access in there. So we can get to a 10-plus 
million dollar deals in Access in one deal, where we were doing $10 million in one quarter three years ago. So, 
that makes it interesting.

Next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Ho
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hi there. I just wanted to get some additional color in terms of the subscriptions that you've been, I guess, selling 
with the firewalls. Is there any way that you can maybe provide some additional perspective on maybe which ones 
are doing well, what the average number of subscriptions being taken are? And, yeah, that would be great. Thank 
you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, Jonathan, obviously, we had four when I joined, and they're all – had over 50% attach rates even before, 
the one which has gone from 0 to 500 is DNS Security in the last two years. As we just announced, we crossed 
the 5,000-customer mark. Many of the newer subscriptions were just launched as part of 10.0 with our software. 
So they're all very recent, which includes IoT, SD-WAN, DLP, those three...

Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
[indiscernible] (00:57:18), right. And, sorry, I got Lee sitting next to me socially distant, so I keep nodding, asking 
him if I forgot anything. But SD-WAN, you can see, is combined with our CloudGenix efforts, so we see SD-WAN 
traction between the two of them. We're seeing a lot of interest in DLP, which is very early. It's only a few weeks

old. And IoT, we see situations, but that's more of an architectural sale it's not just an add subscription, people 
want to look at the IoT architecture for the enterprise. But we launched healthcare IoT, so it's part of the IoT 
efforts.
So, I have expectations from DLP, I have expectations from SD-WAN obviously, with combination of CloudGenix 
and IoT, but I think we'll see different approaches and different sort of trajectories in terms of adoption. IoT is a 
bigger ticket when we sell it. DLP is a simple attach and is easy to deploy, like DNS Security is. So, they take 
different trajectories and different pricing.

Operator: Our last question comes from Andy Nowinski of D.A. Davidson.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew James Nowinski
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co. Q
Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, you mentioned a number of eight-figure deals for both Prisma Access 
and Prisma Cloud, which were record deals for the company. Just wondering if you could provide any more color 
with regard to your overall large deal activity for the quarter, was the activity up year-over-year? And if you did see 
an increase in the overall activity, kind of what drove the growth? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, Andy, I think purely math – I'm waiting for Luis to go look, but purely mathematically, we added the same 
number of customers we did this year than we did last year, and our billings grew 20%. So we got – definitely got 
to have more bigger deals in there. Hurry up, Luis, what are you doing? So yes, we are seeing strength. But I 
would say, it's kind of interesting. If you look at the landscape, the higher end of cloud sales see bigger deals, 
because you're comparing them to large GCP, AWS, Azure spend. So even if you get 2% to 5% of the GCP, 
Azure, AWS commitment, you end up with a large deal, which is typically the seven-plus figure range. And you 
see a similar activity in Prisma Access, because it ends up being a three-year TCV-style deal with – if you get the 
top end, like 100,000-plus users, you end up with a 7.5-figure deal.
XDR in the market typically ends up in the $1 million to $2 million range because of competitive pressures and 
competitive activity. So you just need to do a lot more XDR deals to get there. So, it's different depending 
obviously, firewall, again, depends on the installed base of the estate and the end of life. And ELAs have their 
own characteristics depending on, again, how much estate is there and how much people are re-upping and how 
much software they're buying. But Luis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luis Visoso
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So here is how I look at it. If you add up the billings of the last largest deals that we did this quarter and you 
compare that to a year ago, the total is 35% higher. So it just gives you a magnitude of how significant those large 
deals are for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

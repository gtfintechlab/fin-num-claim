MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Second Quarter Earnings 
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations at Cognizant. 
Please go ahead.

Katie Royce
Global Head, Investor Relations, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings 
release for the company's second quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, 
cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen 
McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the 
responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk 
and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide 
useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the 
corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.

Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining. Earlier today, we announced results for our 
second quarter. Q2 revenue grew 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.14 billion and non-GAAP EPS 
was $0.94. While we are pleased that we met our revenue and margin guidance, we are not satisfied with this 
level of performance. Our second quarter results do not reflect what Cognizant is capable of achieving in this 
market environment neither on revenue growth, nor margin rate. So, as we said about correcting these trends, I'm 
convinced that a large part of what we need to do is in our own control.
Softness in banking and Financial Services, which was up 1.7% year-over-year in constant currency, and 
Healthcare, which was down 1.5% in constant currency, impacted second quarter revenue growth. While certain 
market dynamics have impacted our results, I believe that much of our weakness in banking and in the non-life 
sciences portion of Healthcare is attributable to Cognizant-specific issues. My interaction with clients in both 
industries underline that they are committed to investing in innovation to help increase their competitiveness and 
growth.
Specific to our banking practice, we've recently implemented a new operating model, which includes a team solely 
focused on new logos, a team dedicated to the Platinum accounts which are a subset of our largest global clients, 
and a banking practice and solutions team to ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better

align with key partners. In Healthcare, factors such as the in-sourcing at a large Healthcare payer client and the 
spending pull-back by clients that are in the midst of merger integration impacted our performance in the quarter.
Fundamental market changes reshaping Healthcare, requiring our clients to do more with less and get ahead of 
regulatory compliance and complexity, while dealing with cyber threats and privacy concerns. We have a marketleading position in Healthcare and a position of considerable strength upon which to build. I believe industry 
specialization will be more important than ever with the shift to digital and hence expect to be spending a great 
deal of time with our Healthcare business and clients to ensure we turn around this prized asset.
Over the past three months, we changed out the leaders of both banking and Healthcare to get a fresh 
perspective, new energy and even greater customer focus. On a positive note, we delivered double-digit growth in 
Products and Resources and in Communications, Media and Technology. I continue to be pleased with our 
momentum in international markets. Our global growth markets region, which encompasses our non-North 
America operations, surpassed the $1 billion run rate for the first time in our history. We intend to invest in our 
international business, which should continue to be a growth driver for Cognizant. Later in the call, Karen will take 
you through the details of the quarter, including segment commentary.
As you know, I assumed the role of CEO on April 1. Since then, I have significantly deepened my knowledge of 
the company, whilst reviewing the market opportunity, structure and competitive dynamics. Over the last 18 
weeks, I've met with more than 100 clients and partners across three continents and conducted over 60 deep-dive 
strategic and operational reviews of the company. I've actively solicited client input on our strategy and the 
strength of our commercial and delivery teams. I've also spent a great deal of time considering customer needs 
and buying behavior, our brand position, our business strategy, the effectiveness of our organizational structure, 
our operating discipline, our portfolio of solutions, and indeed, our talent and culture.
It is clear to me that Cognizant has a prior heritage, significant customer loyalty, a broad portfolio of offerings, and 
engaged and talented associates throughout the world. However, we can position ourselves better to participate 
in the market opportunity, and this work includes refining our strategic posture and associated enablers to ensure 
we better participate in the categories that are most relevant to our clients' needs; developing greater thought 
leadership and an innovation agenda by industry vertical; accelerating investments in revenue growth, including 
increased sales and marketing, targeted innovation and enhanced partnerships; significantly lowering our cost 
structure to facilitate these investments in growth and to ensure we are more cost-competitive in deals; and 
ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture to make certain we execute with 
rigor and focus.
Our path to accelerated growth starts with customers, the lifeblood of every company. It is important that we ready 
ourselves to address the pricing demands of customers in our traditional areas of strength, whilst readying 
ourselves also for the changing dynamics in digital. Given advances in technology, customers regardless of their 
industry vertical are faced with an unprecedented pace of change and risk of disruption. Against this backdrop, 
they are focused on modernizing their environments, extracting value from data, better understanding their own 
customers, and accelerating innovation and cloud migration to increase their competitiveness, security and agility.
As investments are shifted to digital, budgets in the legacy are pressured with increased focus on cost reduction 
during renewals. Given our traditional business mix, Cognizant has been exposed to this headwind. We partially 
offset this via [indiscernible] (07:27) management, automation and other delivery efficiency levers. In addition, 
given our strong customer NPS, we have often been able to provide incremental savings to clients by 
consolidating the work of other vendors. While these strategies may be effective in the short-term, we need to 
significantly accelerate our shift to digital as we consider our intermediate and longer term future.

The pivot to digital requires us to rethink many aspects of our company, including our brand, skills, processes, 
systems and tools. Client engagements will become more project-oriented, meaning more contracts with lower 
TCV. Our account teams will need to build relationships with a broader C-suite, as budget owners, decisionmakers and influencers extend well beyond the CIO. We will need more consultative selling skills, more digital 
talents, more targeted sales compensation programs, and more intellectual property and thought leadership 
aligned by industry vertical.
Delivery will be increasingly agile with near and onshore delivery complementing offshore centers. The skills of 
our associates and our leadership team must further evolve. This is a multi-year transition that is essential to our 
future. Against this backdrop, customers are choosing their strategic partners. So, as we more readily embrace 
digital, we must ensure our client-facing resources and our branding represent our strategic ambition. Meanwhile, 
we need to be even more deliberate in our solution portfolio, which includes increasing our investment in areas 
that provide the greatest value to clients, while generating the best return for Cognizant.
This requires a rigorous capital framework to accelerate our position in emerging categories, whilst reducing our 
cost structure in mature and declining categories. We have a strong foundation to build from in some of the 
growth categories. One such example and one I'm extremely excited about is digital engineering. This is a large 
attractive market with 20%-plus growth rates. To accelerate our position in this market, we've recently decided to 
combine Cognizant's digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant Softvision.
Until now, our assets have been distributed across Cognizant, and our structure and operating model have been 
fragmented and inconsistent. This combined practice with over 11,000 associates and revenue of approximately 
$800 million will provide a powerful combination of software product development and application modernization 
services to clients across the globe. I believe that our focused efforts will ensure greater brand recognition in this 
important category and allow us to do more meaningful – more meaningfully participate in the market opportunity.
Our increased focus on digital engineering reflects the market opportunity before us and the growing needs from 
our clients to achieve top line growth, improved customer engagement through superior experience and boost 
productivity at an accelerated pace. With this combined practice, we will bring together current and emerging 
technologies, scale cross-functional teams, and innovate talent and delivery methods into a single product-centric 
operating model.
We are building the digital culture into our operating model that influences how our clients conceive, design, 
engineer and ship digital products at speed. At the same time, we are leveraging decades of experience and 
expertise in our clients' technology stack to produce a cloud-ready architecture. We will finalize our strategic 
positioning in the coming weeks. However, as we enable our customers to disrupt and innovate via modern, 
scalable, agile, data-enabled and future-proof architectures, it is clear that we should further accelerate our 
investments in digital engineering, cloud and IoT. And we must strengthen our partnerships with industry leaders 
to buttress our own capabilities.
That being said, this is not a strategic overhaul, but rather a refinement of the strategic positioning, our capital 
allocation and the enablers critical to execute our strategy. Against this strategic backdrop, we need to determine 
the necessary steps to be taken to unlock Cognizant's growth potential. For this reason, we have established a 
transformation office, which is charged with reviewing six areas of focus as follows.
Strategic choices, which include where we want to make strategic bets to better expose us to growth categories; 
organizational structure, which includes our operating model, our matrix, and roles and responsibilities within this;

talent, which includes attracting, developing and retaining talent; our culture, our compensation structures and our 
skills; delivery transformation, which includes optimizing our unit cost of delivery across a global delivery model; 
sales force transformation, which includes compensation plans, customer segmentation, increased partnerships, 
sales coverage ratios and consultative selling; and finally, fit for growth, which aims to ensure we have the cost 
structure, processes and tools to facilitate growth.
Each work stream is led by a member of our Executive Committee, is cross-functional in nature, and is set against 
a comprehensive change management and communications framework. We've made significant progress in a 
short period of time. I'm personally excited about the findings of the transformation office, which underlines to me 
that we can meaningfully change our competitiveness in this market.
We've identified opportunities to sharpen our strategic focus, simplify the organization, clarify roles and 
responsibilities, empower our teams closer to the customer, and free up investments in growth by significantly 
reducing our cost structure. But we have more work to do in the weeks ahead, including internal change 
management and communications to maximize associate engagement. We expect to outline the details of this 
program, including the execution plan and associated restructuring charges, on the third quarter earnings call.
Happy customers feed the first line of the income statement. So, as we aim to accelerate our revenue growth, I 
want to lead by example by striving to be in front of customers every single day. I've asked for greater innovation 
and growth focus from our executives. Hence, I've made some changes in the leadership team, both external 
hires and indeed internal promotions. Meanwhile, to ensure our senior leaders get closer to our customers and 
our front-line operations, we've initiated a process to optimize our spans and layers. This has the added benefit of 
speeding up decision-making, improving communication and reducing cost.
Growth also requires investments in sales coverage, targeted M&A and a competitive cost structure. Therefore, 
even ahead of the execution of the conclusions of the transformation office, we have moved on a number of 
things, including the acquisition of Zenith Technologies, which expands Cognizant's IoT portfolio and extends our 
life sciences domain expertise by enabling us to become a single-source provider of end-to-end smart factory 
capabilities, a key growth driver in Industry 4.0.
The separation of digital systems and technology, one of our three service lines, from our delivery organization to 
increase focus on that service line; the establishment under one leader of an end-to-end delivery organization 
aimed at dramatically reducing our unit cost of delivery, whilst optimizing delivery KPIs; and the approval to hire 
500-plus revenue-generating associates over the coming quarters, a combination of customer-facing and sales 
support professionals will help us expand existing accounts as we generate new ones.
Finally, we need to drive more of a performance culture in our client teams. Therefore, we will overhaul our sales 
commission plans for the new fiscal year, ensuring we can better attract, retain and reward top performers. The 
new plans will have a greater mix of variable compensation, ensuring greater meritocracy and better align our 
overall incentives with the company's strategic direction. The growth mandate is now starting to permeate the 
entire company, informing our big decisions and investments and beginning to reshape the critical behaviors of 
our employees.
As we focus on growth, we've also made some operational and cost structure decisions that Karen will address 
later in the call. This will help our cost structure in the second half, even ahead of the full conclusions of the 
transformation office. Cognizant is a vast organization brimming with talent. In the time of change, we must 
engage the winning spirit of our 290,000 associates to get back to the basics that resulted in our long record of 
success.

Leaders are key in transitions. For our most talented leaders who are at the director level and above, we recently 
implemented a retention program to let them know how valued they are and how committed we are to their 
continued career growth with us. Communication is more important than ever right now. So, in recent months, 
we've also greatly increased communication to our associates. We've stressed that growth is our number one 
priority and provided context on what is needed for us to return to growth. I personally am spending a lot of time 
meeting with associates, reminding them of our tremendous assets and great heritage that we're building on and 
the substantial market opportunity in front of us.
Let me wrap up by saying that I now have a much clearer understanding of the market opportunity, which is 
meaningful, and Cognizant's opportunities and challenges against this backdrop. While we've taken some tactical 
decisions in the last three months on cost and growth, the true potential of Cognizant and the extent of the work to 
be done on costs and transformation in the quarters ahead is becoming apparent via the transformation office. 
The opportunity teed up from the output of these work streams gives me reason to be optimistic. I see plenty of 
opportunities to take cost out of the business, to invest in growth and to improve our working capital. We will 
spend more time on this in the third quarter earnings call.
I've covered a lot of ground. So, let me quickly underscore the five focal points of our work: refining our strategic 
posture; developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry sector; accelerating 
investments in growth; significantly lowering our cost structure; and ensuring greater operational discipline and a 
more performance-based culture. While there is a lot of work to be done to ensure Cognizant returns to its 
historical levels of performance, I can assure you that our team is up for the challenge and looking forward to 
winning again.
With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on both our operational and 
financial performance, as well as the view on how we see the balance of the year. Karen?

Karen McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $4.14 billion was at the high-end of 
our guided range and represented growth of 3.4% year-over-year or 4.7% in constant currency. Digital revenue 
growth accelerated from previous quarters to the mid-20% range and now contributes approximately 35% of our 
total revenue.
Moving to the industry verticals, where overall company performance continues to be impacted by both Financial 
Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was up 1.7% in constant currency, driven by modest 
improvement in banking, primarily from the contribution of the previously announced partnership with three 
Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform. In insurance, growth 
continued to be sluggish, as delays in decision-making impacted the start of new work from projects in the 
pipeline. We anticipate some improvement in insurance in Q3 with the ramp-up of several of these projects.
In banking, we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients and a cautious approach to spend 
with several of our regional banking clients in North America that were impacted by M&A activity. Consistent with 
recent trends, two of our top five banking clients continue to show good growth, while spend at the other three 
clients remains under pressure. We anticipate some cautiousness in overall levels of spend in the banking sector 
in the second half of the year due to weakness in capital markets across banking, M&A activity with U.S. regional 
banks and weak macro factors.

Moving on to Healthcare, which declined 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare 
vertical, the decline with our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers, as 
well as the accelerated movement of some work to a captive at a large client. The continued ramp-down of an 
account, in which we were a subcontractor to a third-party, also continued to negatively impact revenue. While the 
ramp-down of the work is largely complete, we expect some continued year-over-year revenue impact in Q3 and 
a minimal impact in Q4.
For our payer clients moving work to a captive and those involved in mergers, we expect the second half of the 
year to stabilize near Q2 levels. We continue to expect that there will be meaningful future revenue opportunity 
associated with integration work that typically follows a merger. life sciences had another quarter of double-digit 
growth year-over-year. We are seeing good traction with digital operation services, managing pharmaco-vigilance 
cases globally, large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry-specific platforms such as 
the Shared Investigator portal for clinical trials. And as Brian mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Zenith 
Technologies earlier this week.
Products and Resources had another strong quarter, showing 12.3% growth year-over-year in constant currency. 
This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. We saw continued positive 
momentum in retail, where we have well above the company average mix of digital revenue in our largest clients. 
And we continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive, 
IoT and analytics solutions across clients.
Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 
14.1% in constant currency. Technology saw a double-digit growth, driven primarily by our digital content services 
and solutions. Through our acquisition of Softvision, we are also seeing good traction for digital engineering 
solutions with our technology clients.
Within communications and media, growth was negatively impacted by spending reductions at a few large clients. 
As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to see some slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate 
of the technology vertical, as we start to lap the significant ramp-up of the digital operations work with several 
large clients. We expect this to be partially offset by improvement in communications and media.
Now moving on to the geographies, Europe grew 14.2% year-over-year in constant currency. In both the UK and 
Continental Europe, we saw strength in life sciences. And while a few of our larger banking relationships in 
Europe remained under pressure, we did see good growth from several of our newer logos, including the 
partnership with the three Finnish financial institutions. Additionally, in the UK, we saw strength in Products and 
Resources.
The rest of the world grew 6.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continue to be 
negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. We saw double-digit growth with 
insurance, manufacturing and logistics, and life sciences clients in the region, as well as good traction with 
winning work with a number of new clients.
Shifting now to margins, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.9% and $0.90 respectively. 
Adjusted operating margin, which excludes realignment charges, was 16.1% and our adjusted diluted EPS was 
$0.94 in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations, but down approximately 
300 basis points year-over-year.

While year-over-year head count growth slowed from the prior two quarters, the year-over-year decline in 
operating margin was primarily due to cost related to the head count growth of 7% outpacing constant currency 
revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter and the impact of contract renegotiations with recently merged Healthcare 
clients, which negatively impacted operating margin by 320 basis points and 40 basis points respectively.
Revenue and head count in digital operations continues to grow above company average, and we saw a slight 
increase in the on-site mix at senior levels of the organization. This was partially offset by lower incentive and 
stock-based compensation. The lower segment operating margin in our Communications, Media and Technology 
segment reflects the growth of digital content services and solutions in this segment, which generate lower 
margins than other services in the portfolio.
For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to improve as we align our cost structure with our revenue 
expectations. While we expect to be in a better position to discuss our longer term view of margins in the coming 
quarters, there are several areas that we can and will address in the second half of the year to allow us to reduce 
costs to reinvest in areas to drive growth, including attracting and retaining the best talent and expanding our 
portfolio of digital solutions.
Even ahead of the conclusions of a broader benchmarking exercise, in the second quarter, we took targeted 
actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our organization structure. These actions are expected to 
result in $65 million of annualized savings, with approximately half of that to be realized in the remainder of 2019. 
In Q3 and Q4, we expect to further reduce overall cost through a number of actions, including aligning head count 
growth with revenue growth by further slowing the pace of hiring and being thoughtful on where we backfill 
attrition.
Headcount growth on a full-year basis will align to our full-year constant currency revenue guidance. We'll have 
greater discipline on capturing improved pricing levers, more closely aligning promotions and wage increases with 
bill rate adjustments; more rigor around redeploying unbilled resources in our accounts. We will continue to 
optimize our pyramid by adjusting our spans of control, and we will have enhanced oversight regarding our use of 
subcontractors and the balance between subcontractors and full-time associates.
We will also have significantly tighter control of areas within SG&A, such as disciplined hiring of non-billable 
resources, further rationalization of our real estate portfolio, tighter control over T&E, including significantly 
reduced travel for internal and other non-client-facing meetings; limiting business-class travel, relocation, et 
cetera; and only investing in marketing events that will provide an appropriate rate of return. These actions will 
help fund our continued investment in areas that support revenue growth. Additionally, the shift to higher value 
services such as digital will continue to support higher margins.
From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate of 23% was up from 19% in Q4, but flat versus 
the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management, such as the announced 
retention program to recognize and retain our best talent. We expect to incur an additional $48 million of 
compensation-related cost during the remainder of 2019 for this program.
Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and 
short-term investments, down $1.5 billion from December 31, 2018. This decrease was largely due to the $1.8 
billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date under our stock repurchase program, including over $1 billion 
of repurchases in the second quarter. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted shortterm investments of $429 million related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.

We generated $479 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Additionally, we had an uptick of DSO of three days 
compared to Q2 2018, which negatively impacted free cash flow by $135 million. Approximately half of the DSO 
increase was due to unbilled receivables related to the billing construct of certain long-term contracts. We believe 
that we have the opportunity to improve our cash conversion and are initiating a working capital program that we 
expect will improve free cash flow by several hundred million dollars in the coming quarters.
Our outstanding debt balance was $746 million at the end of the quarter. There was no outstanding balance on 
the revolver. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 18.7 million shares for 
approximately $1 billion, and our diluted share count decreased to 564 million shares for the quarter. On a yearto-date basis, we have repurchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. We have $738 million 
remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Through our cash generated from operations, 
remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access to plenty of 
liquidity to fund both capital return and acquisitions.
I'd now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full-year 2019. For the full-year 2019, we expect revenue to 
grow in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year or $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion in constant currency. Based on 
current exchange rates, this translates to growth within the range of 2.8% to 3.8% or $16.57 billion to $16.73 
billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year compared to 
an assumption of a negative 90 basis points in our prior guidance. This guidance continues to reflect the muted 
outlook for banking and healthcare.
For the third quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.8% to 4.8% year-over-year or 
$4.23 billion to $4.27 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in 
the range of 2.9% to 3.9% year-over-year or $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 
90 basis points for foreign exchange for the third quarter.
For the full-year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17%. Based on the actions 
taken in Q2 and prospective cost alignment actions for the remainder of the year, we anticipate adjusted 
operating margins of approximately 18% in both Q3 and Q4. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the 
range of $3.92 to $3.98, an increase from our previous guidance of $3.87 to $3.95, primarily reflecting a lower 
share count assumption based on the stepped-up repurchases completed in the second quarter and the 
contribution incentive.
This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 562 million shares and a tax rate in the range 
of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges and other unusual 
items if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification if any by the Indian 
government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India defined contribution obligation, 
and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the 
regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration and tax.
With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator?

Hi. Thank you for taking the question. And welcome again, Brian, your first quarter under ownership, so to speak. 
And my question is going to be directed towards you, is there's a lot of moving parts, it sounds like both on how I 
think about the offense of trying to chase revenues, while at the same time trying to balance cost. And so, we 
have your margin targets for the year. But just philosophically, how should we be thinking about these two goals 
of trying to really nurture the revenue line, while at the same time trying to optimize the cost structure? How 
should investors be thinking about this over the course of this longer journey?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Hi, Keith. Well, I mean the first thing I'll say is I do not believe they are mutually exclusive. But let me start first 
with revenue, and then I'll spend some time on cost. We grew, as you know, 4.7% this quarter in constant 
currency. Within that construct, I would say we had very muted performance in two of our larger segments, 
banking and Financial Services and indeed Healthcare, which represent 63% of the business. So, one of the first 
things we have to do to get back to a stronger growth performance is to actually help turn those businesses 
around, just the law of numbers becomes meaningful.
On top of that, I think we are at the stage now of investing more in growth, changing the dialogue internally 
prioritizing growth. As you've seen, we have approved at this moment in time, and I believe over time we will add 
to this number, over 500 revenue-generating resources or revenue support resources. So, the inclination is to get 
back to what we've always done, which has been to focus on client-centricity and revenue growth.
Now, cost is of course – and strategy is important to revenue growth. First of all, what are our strategic postures, 
how are we exposed to faster-growing categories of the market, which are both technology categories such as 
digital engineering, our way of working, IoT, cloud, as well as geographic categories. And that's why I'm pleased 
to see the continued momentum we have in the Global Growth Markets, which is our non-North America region. 
Costs, however, are important to growth, because you need to have a very efficient and disciplined cost base to 
be able to take pricing in the deals, to be able to absorb the renewals pricing pressure that we are seeing in our 
traditional business, as well as being able to invest in the future.
I talked in my prepared remarks around the importance of pivoting to digital and the associated parameters of 
that, smaller TCV contracts, more contracts, a different delivery model, et cetera. We also need to invest in 
people, in M&A, and indeed, in the brand to make sure that we are more associated not just with the area of the 
business where we are loved by customers, but also with the pivot to digital. Many of these areas, as you know, 
Keith, are constrained assets, both M&A targets as well as even just getting digital resources into the company. 
But I will say I'm four months in at this stage. Having interrogated the data for four months and having spent a 
great deal of time in the transformation office, I see huge opportunity here on revenue growth and indeed on cost. 
I'm not going to get into a guidance discussion today around next fiscal year or indeed a multi-year view. But at 
this moment in time, this from my perspective is something that I only see opportunity to improve our performance 
from today's performance.

question.

Tien-Tsin Huang
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Thank you so much. Glad to see a lot of heavy buybacks. Well done there. Just wanted to ask actually there on 
gross margins. It looks like it's the lowest level we've seen in some time. What's driving this? I heard the 
Healthcare renegotiation. I'm not sure if that was related there. Maybe any comments on pricing and contract 
execution, that kind of thing, and maybe any outlook on gross margin? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karen McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Sure. So, Tien-Tsin, it's Karen. It's really two factors, one of which is the Healthcare renegotiations, as you talked 
about. It's about a 40 basis point impact in the fall in gross margin. And then also the fact that head count 
continued to grow faster than revenue in the quarter. Part of that is our digital operations business, which is 
growing considerably faster than company revenue at this point. Headcount grew in line with the revenue growth 
in digital operations, but that does come at typically a lower gross margin than the IT business. But overall, head 
count for the rest of the business did grow faster than revenue and the vast majority of that cost is sitting in gross 
margin, and that is obviously one of the things that, as we continue to focus on tackling the cost of delivery for the 
organization, we will be looking to optimize in the coming months and quarters.

Lisa Ellis
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC Q
Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Hey, Brian, as you're thinking about your overall strategic plan, can you provide a 
little bit more color on how you believe you guys should be tackling the deterioration in Cognizant's traditional 
services, meaning shifting away from or reaccelerating or whatever the right answer is, those more traditional 
legacy pieces of the business, which just at an industry level may be flat or even in structural decline? That strikes 
me as one of the trickier aspects of things to navigate through here. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. It's a good question, because we have strength in our existing customer base, and if you look at 
[indiscernible] (39:06), we have very strong positions and are highly concentrated in a set of customers, but we 
need to pivot more to digital. As we are pivoting to digital, as I said, there are different characteristics of the deals, 
of the skill sets we need, of the delivery models, of the buying decision-makers, if you will, on behalf of the 
customers. And this is an area we definitely want to invest into the next S-curve and make sure we are, from a 
capital allocation point of view, really prioritizing that.
Now, on the more traditional businesses, some of them actually give us a foothold into the new. Application 
modernization will go hand-in-glove, as I said, with the digital engineering space, as we start thinking about cloudnative applications. But in a broader sense of the word, Lisa, I'm a big believer in drawing hard decisions across 
your portfolio and trying to understand where you need to be extremely disciplined from an investment and from a

cost structure point of view in terms of optimizing legacy, whilst investing in the new. And those are disciplines we 
need to obviously continue to drive here in Cognizant, as we're investing in some of these newer growth 
categories that should accelerate our CAGR growth.
You have seen in the last quarter, we have aggregated all of delivery under one leader. Previously, delivery was 
fragmented through a number of leaders in the company. And part of the task of that delivery leader is ultimately 
to drive a much more aggressive stance in terms of how we think about automation and tooling and putting 
ourselves in a position that we can be, what I would term, fit for growth in the legacy, as well as the broader 
company. So, optimizing the cost structure in particular for the legacy and freeing up capital to invest in the new 
categories, which should be the growth driver for Cognizant going forward.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your 
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward S. Caso
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q
Thank you. Welcome. Can you talk a little bit about your capital deployment strategies from this base? Obviously, 
you deployed a lot of capital for repurchase. Where does M&A fit into the equation sort of order of magnitude and 
is there more share repurchase to be done in the near-term? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Well, I'll touch upon this, and Karen can jump in as well. Look, we saw the opportunity to accelerate share 
repurchases in the last quarter as an opportunistic situation for us, and we took advantage of that. And I have no 
issues continuing to do so, if needed. From an M&A point of view, I have rejected some M&A and I have 
approved some M&A in the last four months. So, we will look at that as a means to execute our strategy. We are 
pleased to have acquired Zenith Technologies, which closed most recently.
And obviously, we're using M&A as a means to an end. It is not a strategy. It's a means to execute a strategy. Our 
priority right now is continuing to refine our strategic posture and making sure, to the prior question, we get our 
capital allocation correct. But we will look upon M&A as something that we will use to execute our strategy going 
forward. My emphasis at this moment in time continues to be tuck-in acquisitions that strategically align us to 
better our competitive position in the market that we deem most relevant to us going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karen McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
And I think, Ed – it's Karen – obviously, the guidance for the share count does not assume any more buybacks for 
the rest of the year. As Brian said, we will continue to look at that opportunistically. But as you know, we have far 
exceeded our initial expectations for this year, in line with the framework we outlined last year at Investor Day, 
where we said we expect to spend on average 25% of our global free cash flow towards buybacks, 25% towards 
dividends and 25% for acquisitions, with the rest going to India. At this point, there are no changes to that 
framework. If and when there are, we will obviously update accordingly.

Bryan C. Bergin
Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC Q
Hi. Thank you. Brian, can you give us a sense on just your view of the timeframe of what you think it's going to 
take for Cognizant to address the company-specific issues that you noted in the core verticals there? And then 
the transformation office work streams, has this already been set up and that's in progress or is this now to come 
in 3Q and 4Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
No, the transformation office was set up probably almost three months ago at this stage to be honest. It consists 
of six work streams. As I said, each is led by one of our Executive Committee members. Each one has a steering 
committee and indeed a working committee below that. We've been very clear in outlining suppositions that I want 
us to backfill to an expected outcome, and as part of that, some short-term wins along the way. So, we've been 
also very deliberate, Bryan, in terms of the composition of the teams, making sure we have people that are crossfunctional in nature, people who understand the markets both in North America and internationally, people that 
understand delivery as well as the market-facing commercial teams.
I really feel very, very enthused from the output of the work. We've been working extremely hard on that, but it 
gives me nothing but optimism that there is a huge opportunity for us to free up capital to invest in growth, to 
simplify the organizational structure, to clarify roles and responsibilities, and ultimately, to make us much more 
successful in the market by accelerating revenue growth and having better solutions to bring to bear to our clients. 
So, I feel great about that. It is not a new initiative. It's been well underway, and frankly, I'm probably more 
advanced in my thinking in the output of that than where I potentially considered I would be three months ago.
With regards to banking and Healthcare, we changed out the leaders of both. This will be some heavy-lifting, if I'm 
very honest. Some of it is because of Cognizant-specific issues that are reflective of the market reality of some 
M&A in Healthcare, where we are heavily exposed to four firms that have merged. And some of it candidly relates 
to just the need for us to shift faster to digital, to have more thought leadership, to be even more client-centric, 
and indeed, to add more sales coverage. And those are things that are underway at the moment both in 
Healthcare and indeed in our Financial Services practice or our banking practice.
I should clarify that our Healthcare business in life sciences is very strong. It continues to grow double-digits. It's 
one of the areas of our portfolio that I feel best about. We have a strong strategy, a strong leadership team. We 
know the end-to-end value chain for customers, and therefore, M&A is facilitated against that. We are doing a little 
better in insurance than we are in the core banking business. And as I said on the call, we've made some 
structural changes in the banking team to really put dedicated teams behind hunting on new logos, behind some 
of our most strategic accounts that we deem Platinum, as well as more broadly, I believe that in the world of 
digital, extra emphasis on thought leadership and an innovation agenda is required.
And in my dealings with clients over the last four months, it has become very apparent that we are very 
established in the legacy or traditional models, but our brand attributes and perhaps our thought leadership isn't 
where it needs to be on the side of the house that is digital. And that is an area that we need to do better in. If you 
do look at the competitive market in terms of what has been announced in the last quarter, it's also clear that 
there is market growth out there in banking and indeed in Healthcare. And certainly, from a banking point of view, 
we've seen most of our competitors in Financial Services and insurance grow from the low to the high single-digits 
and indeed some even into the double-digits.

So, we have to accelerate quicker, get back on the attack, make sure we hone our thought leadership and get a 
team that are constantly in front of clients with an agenda around innovation that helps customers think about how 
they can accelerate their pivot to digital. I have not seen in any dialogue with customers, any macro concern 
around their desire to spend on innovation. Invariably, the conversations were very clear. If we show up with 
enough thought leadership and innovation, they have budgets, and of course, the pivot we need to make is to 
ensure we are cost disciplined on the legacy side of our business to ensure that we can absorb those cost 
demands at the time of renewals, whilst accelerating our investments into the new.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with 
your question. Mr. Keane, your line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan C. Keane
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Oh, yeah. Hi. I wanted to ask about attrition. I saw that it was up a little bit, although year-over-year it's pretty 
similar. Where do you expect attrition to go? Do you expect it to stay elevated or do you expect it to come back 
down? And maybe you can just talk about if you guys have lost any key managers or personnel and just thinking 
about the morale of the company through all these changes. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
So, let me start with the broader question around leadership, and then Karen can jump in on the attrition question. 
Listen, I mean to be very clear, in a company of 300,000 employees, we will always have leadership changes and 
it's pretty standard when you have a new CEO who comes onboard. We have been fortunate that at the time of 
my appointment and indeed before that, the board secured certain executives to see through a CEO transition, 
and I'm grateful for their ability to actually get us through that first four to six months of my tenure, because it 
certainly allowed me the time to get deeper into the business and to make sure that I was ready to run forward.
My perspective is we need a greater emphasis on our customers, greater energy, fresh perspective. And 
candidly, in dealing with clients, typically the questions I was asking were how often you've seen our team, the 
thought leadership we brought to bear and how we stack up versus the competition, and also who were some of 
the best people in the industry that they recognize and value as people when they are dealing with them. So, we 
have made some very deliberate changes. Now of course, we've also had some other departures, and I think 
that's normal, particularly in a company that has had a relatively stable leadership team over the best part of two 
decades. This is not something I will say that I am overly concerned about.
The emphasis on growth is permeating through the organization. The people who are touching customers day-in, 
day-out is typically not the executive team, but the client partners. And those client partners are really in my mind 
enthused with the renewed focus on growth after a few years or more focus on margin rate, if you will. Of course, 
don't get this wrong. I'm not taking this for granted by any means. We are paranoid that the first line of the P&L is 
the customer. But from my perspective, this is a very manageable transition we're going through. We've made 
some strong internal promotions.
The new Head of North America, DK, and has been with Cognizant for over 20 years and is ultimately focused 
and has always been focused across multiple verticals on growth. I'm also pleased I've promoted Pradeep in 
delivery, somebody who's been with Cognizant for 23 years, to enable us to get much more focus in terms of 
optimizing our delivery structures. And we complemented them with some external hires, some executives who 
used to work at Wipro, indeed more recently Ganesh Ayyar, who was the ex-CEO of Mphasis. So, my sense is

we want to have the best team we can get our hands on, a team highly motivated, energized, moving with the 
same speed and urgency that I have, and absolutely focused on their teams and on their customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karen McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
And so, Bryan, as it relates to the 23%, as you said, it is flat year-over-year. And as you know, there is some 
seasonality to attrition. So, typically after bonuses are paid in March, we do tend to see attrition tick up. Really no 
changes in terms of the attrition in terms of where it's coming from up and down the pyramid, the only exception 
being the director-plus attrition ticked up a little bit based on the actions that we took in June as far as the 
realignment program. But that would be only real, I would say, significant change in attrition both in terms of 
geography as well as up and down the pyramid. I would expect it's going to continue to be lumpy. As we've said 
for some time now, the job market is strong and as well as, as we look to optimize cost structure for the 
organization, that will in itself, likely to create some churn.

your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Schneider
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As you look forward to the next few quarters, sounds like you 
expect continued muted trends in financials and maybe some improvement in healthcare as you get to the end of 
the year. I guess my question is your Q4 guidance sort of implies that things remain muted kind of across the 
board for some time. Is that just a level of conservatism relative to the outlook or do you actually see some 
headwinds in other segments that could be potentially offsetting that recovery?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karen McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Sure. So, Jim, this is Karen. So, let me tackle that. So, Q3 to Q4, there is actually a decline in bill days of about 
two days, and that will cost about $47 million on a constant currency basis. So, from a modeling perspective, if 
you were to take the middle of the range for Q3 and then the middle of the range for the full-year guidance, that 
would actually say on a volume basis that Q4 will be flat with Q3. There will be some puts and takes. As we've 
talked about in our comments, we do expect to see some stabilization of Healthcare off of the Q2 numbers, not on 
the year-over-year basis. It will continue to show challenges, but we do expect it to stabilize on a sequential basis 
going forward. We do expect, as I said, a little bit of a slowdown in the technology practice, just given the tough 
year-on-year comps as we get back, into the back part of the year. But that was in our guidance both this quarter 
as well as last quarter. So, no real change there from that perspective.

Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
So, this is Brian. I'll start with our position in digital. There are areas that I've been really blown away with and that 
have really – I've left reviews feeling very proud about what we have and feeling as though we definitely have a 
strong foundation to build from. I talked today about the digital engineering team. I've spent a lot of time with 
Cognizant Softvision team. But more broadly, within Cognizant, we had legacy digital engineering as well as the 
application modernization efforts that collectively, it really puts us in a position, if you think about it, 11,000-plus 
resources with over $800 million of revenue, it puts us in an incredible position to increase our brand recognition 
and really dramatically change our position in the market vis-à-vis some of the, let's say, currently known leaders 
out there.
IoT is a few hundred million dollars for us and we have broad offerings that are aligned by industry vertical, and I'd 
expect us to go accelerate that as part of our strategy. More broadly, there are organic investments we need to 
make. There will be some inorganic plays we need to make there too. But as I said, I'm not working on something 
huge at this moment in time and it'll be more tuck-ins aligned to our strategy. Of course, behind any organic and 
indeed inorganic acquisitions, how do you scale digital? Well, you need to have a brand, you need to have 
capabilities, and you need to have systems and tools and a sales and marketing engine to facilitate it. That's why I 
explicitly called out the fact that we are going through a pivot, which requires us to do some work. It's more 
project-oriented work. It's good and bad. You need to sell more projects. They have lower TCV. But unlike the 
legacy business, we will not have the same renewal price erosion that we are faced within the legacy.
We need to have a set of client partners that are capable of speaking to the right level of the organization that 
typically will extend well beyond the CIO, different decision-makers and buyers right from the CMO up to the CFO 
and indeed the CEO, and indeed know how to speak and how to follow-up, and what collateral to leave and what 
use cases to bring in, and obviously, what industry expertise to bring with them into the conversation, more 
consultative selling, and indeed all these practical things that are very often overlooked, but nonetheless critical in 
my opinion to running world-class operation, things like sales commission plans that need to change. And 
therefore, we need to orient more of our commission towards aligning our sales into areas that would be better 
aligned with our strategy.
So, that is not something we've historically done. It is something we will do going into the new year. And indeed, 
the delivery capability from an agile delivery point of view becomes relevant as well. I do feel that as we have 
near, on and indeed offshore capabilities, if you think about something like digital engineering, if we are able to 
take the guild and pod model that we have and extend it not just from near-shore, but indeed off to offshore 
centers, I believe we will have a huge advantage over some of the other players that you know. So, this is an area 
that I'm pumped about. I'm excited about the possibilities we have. And I've seen a lot of goodness in the 
operations. We of course now need to accelerate our investments in it and make sure that we take this strategy 
into execution. But rest assured, we're very focused on that.

Rod Bourgeois
Head of Research, DeepDive Equity Research, LLC Q
All right, thank you. Hey, Brian, so I appreciate your candor in admitting that Cognizant's weak growth in banking 
and Healthcare is mostly due to company-specific issues. And my question is do you have a point of view at this 
point on what Cognizant's growth rate would be today, if it weren't for these company-specific issues that you're 
needing to fix? And I guess on a related note, you're making a lot of internal changes now. I'd like your 
perspective on whether you think these internal changes will cause additional growth disruption in the upcoming 
months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
So, Rod, hi. It's of course hard to extrapolate the implication, but you can do a sliding scale analysis to understand 
that for every 100 basis points of improvement in Healthcare or banking, what is the implied implication on the 
broader Cognizant story. But given they are 63% of the business, you can clearly understand that these are 
meaningful shifts to our overall numbers. And every 160 basis points – $160-or-so million of growth is 1 point of 
growth for us and every $6 million of bottom line is $0.01 EPS for us. So, these are important levers for us to get 
right.
We do have a lot of balls in the air at the moment, and that's why we are very, very deliberate around the 
transformation office. We have staffed it with people who know the company well. They have been surrounded by 
management consultants, both internal and indeed external. And we have a huge operation cadence behind that 
and a broad framework of change management, communication and indeed an execution layer that needs to 
happen. And Rod, by definition, you will always go home at night wondering if you're going too far too fast. But 
I've got to be honest, I have a great sense of urgency. I'm really proud to have this role. I'm really proud to have 
inherited an organization that is, in my mind, full of talent, and I want to lead them forward. And I believe that we 
are going at the right pace to catch up where we need to catch up and to extend our leadership where we think 
we're in front.
But we're spending a lot of time around operational excellence and rigor, and making sure we contextualize these 
changes. It's clear, certain employees will be concerned around the amount of work and the hours and the pace 
and the decision-making. But my belief is that my executive level, I've had a number of Executive Committee 
meetings now. We have a cadence of two days every month. We've had some really, really constructive meetings 
where the team are on board and we are making the decisions, in my opinion, needed at this moment in time to 
put Cognizant in a position where we can unlock our true potential.

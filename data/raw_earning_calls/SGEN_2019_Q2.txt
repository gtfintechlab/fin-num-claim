President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone.
In the past few months, we've delivered on several important goals, focused on growing our flagship brand, 
ADCETRIS, and continuing our evolution into a multi-product oncology company. Our late-stage portfolio includes 
enfortumab vedotin, which has been submitted to FDA for approval in metastatic urothelial cancer based on the 
positive outcome of the EV-201 trial. In addition, we're advancing to other programs in pivotal trials; tucatinib in 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and tisotumab vedotin in metastatic cervical cancer.

I'll begin with some comments on ADCETRIS, which is an important global product for the treatment of 
lymphoma. Under our collaboration with Takeda, it is now available in 73 countries. In the U.S. and Canada, we 
reported record ADCETRIS sales of $159 million dollars in the second quarter, up 18% percent from the first 
quarter of the year. This growth was mainly driven by increased utilization in frontline peripheral T-cell lymphoma. 
There was also increased use in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition, these results reflect second quarter 
strength that we have previously seen with ADCETRIS. We will provide more detail on our commercial progress 
later in the call.
Outside the U.S., we and our partner, Takeda, are continuing to expand the approved indication for ADCETRIS. 
In frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, we received Canadian approval in May, and Takeda recently received approval in 
a third key country outside of Europe and Japan. This triggered a milestone payment to us of $7.5 million. To 
date, we've achieved a total of $118 million in milestones under our collaboration, including $47.5 million related 
to frontline Hodgkin lymphoma approvals in Europe, Japan and key countries.
For frontline PCTL, we submitted our approval application to Health Canada in May, and Takeda also plans to 
submit frontline PTCL for approval to the EMA and other health authorities this year.
Next is enfortumab vedotin, or EV, which we're developing in collaboration with Astellas. Today, we announced 
the BLA submission to the FDA for accelerated approval of EV in metastatic urothelial cancer based on results 
from the EV-201 study. The data were featured in an oral presentation at ASCO and selected for an ASCO press 
briefing. We are encouraged with the positive reception to these data by the physician community.
In anticipation of potential approval, our launch preparation is rapidly advancing. EV is positioned to become our 
next marketed drug and if approved will expand our commercial portfolio beyond hematologic malignancies into 
solid tumors. We are working closely with Astellas to advance and expand the clinical development program for 
EV, including in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer. Roger will recap the EV-201 results, as well as the clinical 
development plan during his remarks.
We're also advancing two other solid tumor candidates in late-stage development. These include tucatinib in 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and tisotumab vedotin, or TV, in metastatic cervical cancer. We expect to 
report top line data from the tucatinib pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB later this year and from the TV pivotal trial 
called innovaTV 204 in the first half of 2020.
Lastly, I want to highlight the first FDA approval from one of our technology licensees, Polivy, or polatuzumab 
vedotin is an ADC developed by Genentech that targets CD79b. It was approved more than two months ahead of 
the PDUFA date for patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Genentech is conducting several 
additional trials of Polivy including in frontline DLBCL.
Amongst several other collaborators that use our technology, GSK is advancing an ADC in late-stage 
development targeting BCMA, This ADC has PRIME and BTD designations, and GSK has stated that they are 
planning a regulatory submission in the second half of this year.
At this point, I'd like to introduce our Chief Commercial Officer, Robin Taylor, who joined Seattle Genetics in May. 
Robin was most recently at AstraZeneca; and before that, he spent more than 17 years at Genentech. He's 
contributed to the global commercial development and strategic marketing of several successful oncology drugs. 
His skills are well-suited to driving our global commercial presence, including the planned launch of EV, as well as 
other potential drugs emerging from our pipeline such as tucatinib. We are pleased that he's joined the team.

Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thank you, Clay.
I'm tremendously excited to have joined Seattle Genetics at this transformational time. I was drawn to the 
company based on the strong leadership team, the innovative science, and the clear focus on patients as 
demonstrated by the continued investment in new indications for ADCETRIS and the exceptional late-stage 
pipeline. This is an important time for the commercial organization with the planned launch of EV and pivotal data 
anticipated for tucatinib later this year.
Let me turn now to our second quarter results. ADCETRIS net sales in the U.S. and Canada were $159 million in 
the second quarter, an increase of 30% compared to the same quarter in 2018. For the first half of 2019, 
ADCETRIS sales were $294 million, a growth rate of 35% for the first half of the year compared to the first half of 
2018.
We attribute the growth in Q2 to three main drivers. First, we've observed continued strong uptake of ADCETRIS 
plus CHP in CD30-expressing PTCL following the U.S. approval of this indication in November 2018. This is 
driven by the positive ECHELON-2 data, including the overall survival advantage that showed at 34% reduction in 
the risk of death compared to CHOP.
Second, we have seen continued growth of ADCETRIS in Stage III and Stage IV frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. 
This reflects a positive reception to the three-year PFS data from ECHELON-1 trial reported at ASCO. In addition, 
there has been an increase in patient engagement, with growth in unique visitors to our online resources and 
downloads of the ASCO doctor brochures. This encourages patients to ask their physicians about all available 
options for frontline treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. The update to the NCCN Guidelines in April 2019 may also 
have contributed.
And third, we have historically observed the strongest sequential growth between Q1 and Q2 for ADCETRIS, with 
continued but more moderate growth in other quarters of the year. Based on these historical patterns, we are 
maintaining our guidance of full year 2019 ADCETRIS net sales in the range of $610 million to $640 million.
Finally, we're actively preparing for the commercial launch of enfortumab vedotin with our partner, Astellas. Sales 
force hiring is very close to complete, and we're beginning training activities to ensure that we are fully prepared 
for launch. Having participated in multiple successful oncology drug launches over my career, I've been pleased 
with the depth and rigor of the preparation of the commercial team at Seattle Genetics to date. I'm confident that 
we will be ready for the EV launch upon FDA approval.
Let me turn now to Todd to provide the finance update.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Robin, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. So, today, I'll summarize 
our financial results for the second quarter and year-to-date, as well as provide two updates to our financial 
outlook for the year. Total revenues were $218 million in the second quarter and $440 million for the year-to-date 
in 2019. This included record ADCETRIS net sales in the U.S. and Canada of $159 million in the second quarter 
and $294 million for the first half of the year.

Growth in 2019 primarily reflects the frontline label expansions in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL and the other 
dynamics that Robin described. Royalty revenues in the second quarter of 2019 were $23 million compared to 
$21 million in the second quarter of last year. For the first half of 2019, royalty revenues were $39 million 
compared $36 million in the first half of last year. We expect ADCETRIS royalties to increase throughout the year 
as Takeda sales grow and as increasing sales trigger higher royalty rates. As a reminder, royalty revenues in 
2018 included Takeda's portion of third-party royalty obligations paid on ADCETRIS, some of which expired in 
2018. Therefore, despite the increases in sales by Takeda, royalty revenues grew at a lower rate, while cost of 
royalty revenues decreased.
Going forward, royalty revenues will also reflect amounts earned on net sales of collaborator ADCs, such as 
Polivy. However, this did not contribute to second quarter results and is not included in our guidance. 
Collaboration revenues, which includes amounts earned under our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda and our 
ADC deals, were $36 million in the second quarter and $81 million for the first half of 2019. This included the 
earned portion of $13 million in milestones achieved in the second quarter and $43 million in the first half of 2019, 
most notably by Genentech's recent approval of Polivy and Takeda's approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin 
lymphoma.
R&D expenses were $164 million in the second quarter and $322 million for the first half of 2019. The increases 
over 2018 primarily reflect investment across our pipeline primarily on our late-stage programs EV, tucatinib and 
TV.
SG&A expenses were $82 million in the second quarter and $163 million in the first half of 2019. These increases 
reflect commercial efforts to support ADCETRIS in the new frontline indications, as well as costs related to our 
late-stage pipeline programs.
We ended the second quarter with $376 million in cash and investments. This is in addition to $107 million in 
Immunomedics at the end of the second quarter. These shares are mark-to-market, which causes variability in 
our financial results and is not core to our business. This resulted in a non-cash investment loss of $43 million for 
the second quarter, which was slightly higher than a similar non-cash gain in the first quarter.
Lastly, I want to highlight two updates to our 2019 financial guidance. First on revenues, given the recent 
milestones under the Takeda and Genentech deals, we are increasing our guidance for collaboration revenues to 
a range of $110 million to $125 million.
And secondly on SG&A expenses, in anticipation of the EV BLA submission announced this morning, we 
proceeded with hiring substantially all of the enfortumab vedotin U.S. sales organization. As a result of this, we 
are increasing and narrowing our guidance for SG&A expenses to a range of $335 million to $360 million. Our 
other guidance remains unchanged.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.

Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Clay mentioned, the positive EV-201 pivotal trial results were 
featured in an oral session at ASCO in early June and are also part of the subsequent Best of ASCO programs. 
Among metastatic urothelial cancer patients who'd received both a platinum regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitor, the confirmed response rate was 44% by blinded independent central review, including a 12% complete 
response rate.

For context, single agent chemotherapy, which is the current standard of care in this setting, shows limited activity 
with a response rate of approximately 10% with complete responses rarely obtained. Responses in EV-201 were 
observed across all patient subgroups including those with liver metastases, who have particularly poor 
outcomes. The median duration response was clinically meaningful at 7.6 months. EV was tolerable with a 
manageable safety profile. The most common treatment-related adverse events included fatigue, alopecia, 
decreased appetite, rash and peripheral neuropathy.
Notably, the results are consistent with the earlier Phase 1 experience in the same heavily pretreated patient 
population. Based on these results, we and Astellas have submitted a BLA to the FDA, seeking accelerated 
approval of EV. As a reminder, we have breakthrough therapy designation in this patient population.
The remarkable activity of EV monotherapy in patients with multiply treated metastatic urothelial cancer provides 
substantial development opportunities for EV to address a wide array of unmet medical needs. Our EV 
development plan is focused in four key areas.
First, enrollment is ongoing in the second cohort of the EV-201 trial of metastatic urothelial cancer patients who've 
received the PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment but are ineligible for cisplatin and are platinum naïve.
Second, the ongoing confirmatory randomized trial, EV-301, which is intended to support global regulatory 
submissions, continues to enroll well.
Third, the ongoing EV-103 trial, which combines EV with pembrolizumab and/or platinum chemotherapy in the 
first line metastatic setting, this is the precursor to a frontline randomized trial and we expect to report data from 
the EV plus pembrolizumab cohort later this year.
And fourth, trials are being planned in earlier stages of urothelial cancer such as muscle invasive bladder cancer, 
as well as our Nectin-4-expressing tumors.
I'll move on now to ADCETRIS which was the subject of numerous presentations at ASCO, as well as the 
European Hematology Association and the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma Meetings. Across 
these three congresses, we reported on several important datasets. First, we showed that with an extended 
follow-up on the ECHELON-1 trial, the PFS benefit for ADCETRIS plus AVD determined by investigators was 
maintained.
The three-year PFS was 83.1% compared to 76% in the ABVD arm, a difference of 7.1%. Importantly, consistent 
improvement in PFS was observed among patients treated with the ADCETRIS regimen across the majority of 
pre-specified subgroups, including disease stage and prognostic score.
Second, analyses of several trials including ECHELON-2 showed responses in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients 
across all levels of CD30 expression. These data support the notion that there may be no specific expression 
level required for efficacy.
And third, multiple abstracts highlighting the activity of ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab including in 
Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Importantly, ADCETRIS plus nivolumab was 
recently added to NCCN treatment guidelines for second line Hodgkin lymphoma.

Lastly, we are now initiating additional trials of ADCETRIS that may result in label expansions, two of which are 
mentioned today. One trial will evaluate retreatment with ADCETRIS in Hodgkin and T-cell lymphoma patients 
who progressed after a prior response, including in patients who've received ADCETRIS in the first line setting. 
Encouraging data with retreatment in the relapse refractory setting have been previously published.
We are also initiating a trial of ADCETRIS in Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL patients who are unfit for combination 
chemotherapy, either due to old age or comorbidities. This is an area of high unmet need. We believe that 
generating data for a labeled indication is important for physicians and patients. We also expect to initiate 
additional label enabling and practice informing trials, and we'll keep you posted as our plans progress.
Next, I'd like to briefly highlight the status of our late-stage programs; tucatinib and tisotumab vedotin, both of 
which are in registration trial. Tucatinib is a potentially best-in-class oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets 
HER2. We are conducting a randomized pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB in heavily pretreated HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases. Patients in this setting have a poor outcome 
with standard of care treatments. HER2CLIMB enrollment is complete and we continue to expect to report the 
top-line results for the primary endpoint of PFS later this year.
We are also initiating this year a Phase 2 randomized trial of tucatinib in combination with T-DM1 compared to TDM1 alone in the second line metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer setting. The primary endpoint is PFS with a 
key secondary endpoint of OS. With this trial, we aim to show improved outcomes, combining tucatinib with a 
HER2 ADC, which is a well-established standard of care in earlier lines of breast cancer. Data from a published 
Phase 1 trial supports evaluating this combination.
Tisotumab vedotin or TV is an ADC-targeting tissue vector that we are developing in partnership with Genmab. 
We are conducting a pivotal Phase 2 single-arm, single-agent trial in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer where there is no standard of care and outcomes are poor. The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed 
objective response, enrollment is complete and we are following patients for response assessment and 
importantly durability of response. We estimate reporting topline data in the first half of 2020. If positive, the trial 
could support a regulatory submission on the FDA accelerated approval mechanism.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Clay.

Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Roger. We've accomplished much in the first half of 2019, and the second half of the year is poised for 
many additional activities that are important to our goal of bringing drugs to patients in need. These include, first, 
continuing to establish ADCETRIS as the standard of care in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline PTCL, and 
initiate clinical trial to further expand the ADCETRIS label; second, work with FDA on our EV submission in 
collaboration with Astellas, report initial results from the first line EV-103 trial, and expand the EV development 
program with several new trials; and third, report top-line data from the tucatinib pivotal trial HER2CLIMB later in 
2019 and advance the TV pivotal trial in cervical cancer towards top line data in the first half of next year.
I'm excited by the progress we're making with ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, and the rest of our product 
pipeline. We'll keep you updated on our progress.
At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kennen MacKay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. For the team, first off, big congrats on the quarter. I was just wondering if you 
could help us understand the decision not to increase guidance here. I ask because given the recent price hike in 
ADCETRIS, it seems like you'll squarely be within your guidance with zero growth but only 3% sequential quarterover-quarter growth in Q3 and Q4 has the upper end of guidance, which seems quite doable. Is there anything we 
should be reading into here? And also on that topic, I was just wondering if you could help us understand the 
ADCETRIS inventory in Q2. Could there maybe be a week or two of stocking here given the June 28 price hike? 
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks, Kennen. Thanks for the questions. So when we think about ADCETRIS, it's a really important brand. It's 
growing as a brand in the U.S., growing international, and we're pleased with what we're seeing. We reiterated 
the guidance, and please note we're giving annual guidance, we're not giving quarterly guidance that we did while 
we were in the middle of getting frontline approvals. And so we reiterated $610 million to $640 million, which is 
30% over 2018, and so it's a strong guidance. And we're trying to be as accurate as we can. We have a range 
there and we have good connection with docs. And our three-year PFS data with E1 was particularly important. 
And E2 data was spectacular, you know that, not only with PFS but with OS but Q2 is typically strong.
Now, looking out into the future it's really hard to know exactly what we're going to get. It's hard work out there. 
We're continuing to displace decades old standard of care that are entrenched in the marketplace and we're 
working hard at it. We like what we see a lot. We still feel that our products are growing and that's – our guidance 
indicates that. And I would just say to stay tuned and we're out there at full force. Our commercial team is doing 
well and we're really connecting with docs.

Your second question, Kennen. We have really no evidence that there's really any stocking, as you call it, the 
inventory. We really don't see that. We know that there are some big cancer centers that will – more vials in the 
small cancer centers because they treat more patients, but that's not really stocking. So we don't see any 
evidence for stocking of ADCETRIS. We deliver in real time, people order it, they get it quickly. And so we feel 
really good about where we are and we just don't see sites accumulating inventory

Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
And Kennen, this is Todd. I want to add just one more comment. You talked about the price increase. We did 
have a 3.9% price increase in July but keep in mind that we only see about half of that come through our net 
sales because of the discounting and the gross-to-net, particularly around the PHS share of our business which is 
pretty significant.

Kennen MacKay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Thanks that's really quite helpful context, especially given the current political environment and I think important to 
remember. Maybe just want one follow up for Clay and maybe also for Robin. Just wondering if you can help us 
understand the changes that you've been making with the ADCETRIS sales force here. It seems like – tracking 
the website, there's been quite a bit of hiring going on here. Is that also sort of playing into the increased 
ADCETRIS sales that we saw in Q2 and is that responsible for the SG&A guidance increase, or is that more the 
EV sales force? Thanks and congrats again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
First of all thanks for mentioning we had a good quarter. Yeah, we're very proud of that. It is really more related to 
the last thing you said, the EV sales force. We thought it would be important to have some of our sales people 
from ADCETRIS go to the EV program for continuity and connection. And so we replaced some of the people on 
the ADCETRIS sales force. Robin, do you want to talk about the folks that we're getting, the type of people that 
are looking to come work with us, both on ADCETRIS and EV?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. No, what I'd say is that we're seeing very strong interest in Seattle Genetics. The hiring on the EV sales 
force, as I mentioned, is almost fully complete and we have a lot of interest in those roles. We did have a few folks 
come over from the ADCETRIS sales force over to EV, and of course what you saw online was some of the 
backfills for those positions. But I would say that we've got a really high performance group with great depth of 
oncology experience for the EV sales force.

Q
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and this is [ph] Matthew (00:27:25) on for Cory. So for my first question, 
I'm trying to understand the potential impact of the international pricing index proposal on ADCETRIS pricing and 
was wondering if you could provide any qualitative or quantitative commentary in that regard to this policy being 
implemented.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks, Matt. Look, we're aware of the issues and closely track them. It's certainly dynamic. There's changes 
literally daily or frequently. We're paying attention like any biotech or pharma company is. Ultimately, we believe 
fully that innovative medicines that provide meaningful benefits will continue to be valued by patients, physicians 
and payers. ADCETRIS is a first-in-class drug; EV, another drug that we believe will be first-in-class. And these 
are drugs that really have an impact on patients and they're valuable. And so we're watching. I'm not sure what'll 
happen exactly. I think you're as sure as we are.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. Thanks. And then my second question is on tucatinib and the initial data expected this year for the 
HER2CLIMB. I'm just curious what you're hearing from KOLs in terms of what PFS value or hazard ratio would be 
clinically meaningful in the context of all the other available treatments in this space?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. We're really excited about HER2CLIMB and coming forward with data later this year. Roger, do you want to 
go talk a little bit about the context of what's out there in the world?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Yeah. It's a good question. So the HER2CLIMB trial has some unique aspects to it, particularly the patient 
population that's been enrolled with a very high frequency of patients with brain metastases. So it is an extremely 
high unmet need population. The trial design is a triplet versus a doublet with tucatinib added on to trastuzumab 
and capecitabine. We think is a very thoughtful design that may result in positive outcomes.
In terms of what is a meaningful delta, I think it's very hard without seeing the data to make any specific 
comments on that. Again, there isn't really historical control that you can absolutely map to, and the unmet need is 
very high. So everything is a relative decision and I think that's about where we can go at this point. But we're 
excited, as Clay said. The trial enrolled well. We're hoping to get the readout by the end of the year, and of course 
we'll know at that time.

Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Hey. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter from me as well. I had a question again on 
the ADCETRIS sales number for this quarter, it sounds like – and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like much 
of the ADCETRIS sales growth was driven by increased use in PTCL. And I was just wondering if you could 
comment a little bit more about on what are you seeing in terms of market dynamics in PTCL right now, for 
example? What market share do you have in frontline treatment at the moment, and are those rates comparable 
in the different subtypes of TCL?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thank you for your questions, Michael. So first of all, as we said in the prepared remarks, we think that as we 
track this, our growth in revenue was attributed to both the E2 regimen which is in PTCL growth, as well as in the 
E1. Now in the E2, we're not going to report the different subtypes. We could tell you that they're being used in all 
the subtypes as far as what we can find, but we're not going to report specifics about that. We also don't report 
the specific market share. What we can say is that we predicted that it would take a number of quarters to get 
bigger and bigger market share because this was a regimen that we were displacing CHOP specifically in PTCL. 
That was around for almost three and a half decades. So this is – it's not that easy to displace these entrenched 
therapies. Now the good news with the E2 regimen is we had not only PFS data but OS data.
And so now let's switch to E1, the E1 regiment for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. And there, as you know, we 
experienced a little headwinds in the past. We had to – we've got a lot of early adopters, and then we had some 
docs that said, look, I know how to treat frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. I've been doing it for decades well and 
you're showing us data that's only of limited duration of follow-up. We'd like to see some more. So this year, for 
instance, we have shown now 37 months of follow-up data and the data actually improved with time.
So now if you just look at PFS, good old fashioned PFS and you look at 37 months, we are now 7.1% better in 
PFS. And that's important because while you can't yet call these cures, these are a long-term disease survival. 
And once you got out past five years or the definition of a cure from oncologists, we can start calling it that. But it 
is likely that a lot of these patients will go a while along, and hopefully within the not-too-distant future, we can 
really look at what could be a cure rate increase in Hodgkin lymphoma. And going from the two year data that we 
produced when we first got approval to the 37-month data that came out with PFS, I think that caught a lot of 
doctor's attention. And so they looked at this, they saw it and they were comforted by that because we don't yet 
have OS which in E1 – in the E1 regimen of frontline Hodgkin lymphoma was not contemplated to have yet. So 
there was nothing wrong it just takes a while.
With E2 and PTCL, the standard of care wasn't nearly as good as it was with E1, the Hodgkin regimen. So I really 
understand what doctors are saying. I understand that they wanted to see a little bit more aging of our data and 
the data improved with age. So I think that's a big deal, too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Okay, thanks. So then I had a pipeline question regarding tisotumab vedotin. I know the initial indication is 
obviously [indiscernible] (00:34:12), but I was just wondering when we might learn about the potential of that age 
and other solid tumors?

Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah, we're definitely looking at cervical cancer. Roger, can you touch on a little bit of generally what we're 
looking at with TV?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So the program is configured to evaluate cervical cancer, as you mentioned, in a pivotal trial with data 
readouts, hopefully in early – or in 2020. But we have other efforts going on. So we in fact have a basket trial 
which is looking at other tumors that express tissue factor where TV potentially has the role and that's an ongoing 
trial at the moment. We haven't read out data yet, but obviously when we do we'll present that. We also have an 
effort going on specifically in ovarian cancer. So we have a number of different trials outside of cervical cancer 
exploring the potential for TV in other diseases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
And what I would add also is we actively speak with our partners Genmab often about trying to maximize TV. So 
just so that you know, we're excited about the product and working hard on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
And maybe one piece to add is we in fact do have the beginnings of a combination trial with TV and 
pembrolizumab as well, so that's up and running.

Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Thanks. I appreciate it and congrats on the quarter, guys. I also had two questions, one on PTCL given the 
prepared comments. And I know you said you wouldn't talk about different subgroups, but is this a disease or 
opportunity that we should think of as a prevalent opportunity, or is it really new patients that are driving what 
you're seeing? Is there a possibility patients are going to get ADCETRIS through multiple lines of therapy when 
they relapse and it's more of a prevalent disease.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So on PTCL, we're out there talking about is the data on per incident patient. And so that's what we're looking at, 
newly diagnosed incident patients. So we don't have a lot of data on prevalent. I mean we still have approval to 
treat relapse patients, and that's one of our labels especially in ALCL and some other in CTCL. But we are really 
focused on the newly diagnosed patients and working with our commercial team and doctors to get newly 
diagnosed patients ADCETRIS CHP because the data is so clearly positive, and not just on PFS, but on OS, and

you look at the capital markers and you'd be hard pressed to find bigger white space between Kaplan-Meier 
Curve in clinical trials. This is a really positive dataset that I feel that patients and doctors should really look at this 
before jumping into a different therapy because they can really be benefited.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Okay. And then one of the things we've heard from some of the community docs is that buying and billing the 
patient is a real concern for some of the docs with private practices. I was wondering if you guys have heard that, 
and if so what efforts could be done to kind of waylay some of those fears and financial concerns with the 
clinicians?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
We haven't really heard much about it at all. I have to say, as far as physicians getting reimbursement in PTCL, 
which is I think what you're looking at, we really have not heard that there's issues out there. We think that our 
market share is growing in this space as we predicted. We think it was going to take some time to grow a 
previously entrenched therapy, and it's – we're pretty much on track for what we thought the growth rate would be 
on a quarter-to-quarter basis with the E2 regimen of PTCL. So I don't view what you said, this buying and billing 
thing, as an issue.

Andrew Berens

It wasn't limited to E2. I was talking about ADCETRIS and really Hodgkin lymphoma I think is where these 
comments originated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I have to say, we just aren't hearing it in the way you are, so I don't know where this information comes. I'll 
certainly explore this with the commercial team, but I don't think we are seeing this. Todd, you have a comment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Well, I was just going to say, the other thing to keep in mind is we have an incredibly efficient model where a site 
can order drug today and they'll have it tomorrow. So there isn't this need to buy ADCETRIS and hold it because 
of a concern or a fear that it's going to take weeks and weeks and weeks for your drug to show up. We're literally 
overnight shipping.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Maryana Breitman
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking our questions. This is Maryana Breitman for Salveen. We had a couple. One, we 
were wondering with the NCCN updates for Hodgkin lymphoma, do you have any color on changes to prescriber 
activity due to updated guidelines? And we were also wondering about tucatinib opportunity in metastatic breast 
cancer, especially in patients with brain metastases, how you're thinking about that opportunity, how you're 
thinking about going into that market? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thank you for the two questions. Concerning the NCCN that you asked, we think that certainly we like the new 
wording with NCCN, but it's not really – it's hard to know what that impact will be or what that impact was. We 
think that the three-year PFS data that was showed at ASCO and we think that the response from doctors, we 
think is the most valuable thing that we have, because we could tell that they look at that closely.
With NCCN, that also connects with how pathways are and how doctors prescribe it. And those are things that 
evolve slowly, pathways don't meet very often at all, and that – it takes its own life and we're not really part of that. 
But the data and the way doctors respond to this age data that's improved and really give benefit to the patient, 
that's really what we think is the most important thing for the increased E1 regimen sales that we are seeing.
Now you ask about tucatinib and the opportunity. Tucatinib is something that is a drug that we think could be a 
best-in-class drug, it's clearly not the first of the HER2 TKIs out there. There are a few of them so it's a validated 
pathway. But our goal is to really raise the bar and get to that next level with helping patients with a very potent 
drug but one that doesn't bind to EGF receptor and cause all that toxicity that you would have with some of the 
other HER2 TKIs.
As far as a specific benefit, and I'm talking about the size of the population, it's a little early for us to do that. We're 
still working on our pivotal trial and it's an event driven trial. We have guided to later this year for data to come out. 
And then let's just see what happens with the data. And there's plenty of time in the future to talk about the 
specific opportunity and I really think it depends on the data.
We have – the primary endpoint is all of the patients put together. And then the secondary endpoints include, 
importantly, brain metastasis. So this is a unique trial design with a couple of different data sets that'll result from 
the data. And I think that looking at the opportunity for this will really depend on whether this works on all patients, 
including [indiscernible] (00:42:54) patients what works most on one or another set of patients, then we could 
adequately start addressing your question. But until then, we'll hold off on it and are excited to address this 
question in the hopefully not too distant future or later this year.

Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Thank you very much for taking my questions. And also a follow-up with tucatinib, maybe I will ask. Wondering if 
you can remind us the event rates of a PFS, and also if the trial designs do designed to detect 50% PFS 
improvement. And another related question is regarding the brain met patient what is the percentage of patients 
you plan to enroll?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay, so I got your three points there. So the event rates for PFS, we have not reported and that's something that 
we keep confidential. The amount to detect a 50% improvement also is internal information and that's not 
something we'll be reporting. We have said that we are planning to enroll, and I know it has – this is true because 
all the patients are enrolled that we have roughly half the patients have preexisting measurable brain met. And 
that makes as one of the uniqueness of this trial. We're really addressing a major unmet medical need.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Great. And I have one quick follow-up regarding ADCETRIS quarter revenue. So you mentioned that the majority 
– that the growth is driven by frontline PTCL, is it fair to say out of $24 million quarter-over-quarter growth, close 
to $20 million will be from frontline PTCL? And should we expect the future growth mainly driven by the PTCL 
revenue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I think our prepared remarks said that we're really pleased with the growth in frontline PTCL but we also have 
growth in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. We did not look at breaking that apart nor do we plan on breaking it apart. 
I think looking forward, we continue to see that we are getting increased market penetration, and that goes for 
PTCL which was approved like almost a year later than Hodgkin lymphoma. Maybe it was early in 2018 to late in 
2018, so maybe a little less than a year.
So front line Hodgkin lymphoma's been out there a little longer and its growth rate is probably a little slower at this 
point just because it's out there a little longer than frontline PTCL, but both are growing and we're really pleased 
with what we're hearing from docs out there. And I know we had a bunch of questions on guidance. It's hard to 
really give guidance on this. We're in uncharted territory in frontline Hodgkin and frontline PTCL, and the data we 
have is great. The age data is great. Doctors are rallying to this and we're out there trying to do the best we can 
by patient. And what I would say is stay tuned on this and we'll provide you with whatever data and follow-up that 
we can when it's appropriate.

Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Clay, I just wanted to get a sense on the sales force that 
Todd had talked about you guys have hired. How big of a sales force do you anticipate you'll need for EV in the 
U.S., and do you plan on hiring all those sales people at once?
And then secondly for tucatinib, as that dataset reads out, I guess what kind of data should we expect at the top 
line? What level of efficacy would you consider to be clinically meaningful? And how important is it for you to show 
a better safety profile than currently-approved treatment, vis-à-vis especially diarrhea rates? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. So let's – those are two different questions. Let's start talking about the sales force for EV, and I'd like to 
turn it over to Robin to kind of explain our thoughts here. Robin?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Clay. So we've worked really closely with Astellas to size the sales force to ensure that we have a 
broad reach to healthcare practitioners who treat metastatic bladder cancer. We'll have with Astellas an equal 
number of reps in the field. We will utilize our existing commercial infrastructure for activities to just manage 
markets and distribution, but we will also have some brand-specific roles such as the dedicated EV marketing 
team. And that's really sort of where we stand, which is an equal partnership with Astellas here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So the second question is on tucatinib and talking about efficacy and the safety profile. And for sure, the reason 
we acquired Cascadian to largely get this drug is that we saw a really exciting drug from a safety standpoint 
because it didn't bind to EGF receptor. And a really exciting drug from an efficacy standpoint in single-arm studies 
– I'll repeat that, single-arm studies – and the onus is on us to perform in a randomized study in order to get 
registration.
So Roger, can you talk about some of what – give context to where we are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So as you know, HER2CLIMB is fully enrolled. Just to reiterate some of the points, this is a high unmet 
need population with a substantial proportion of patients with brain metastases. There is really no historical 
precedent that we can actually define what the potential for the control arm would be. Based on the profile of 
tucatinib with highly selective HER2 inhibition, it's lack of inhibition of EGFR, that is a potential best-in-class 
molecule. Those characteristics are key to both its efficacy and its safety and its tolerability. So, as Clay said, the 
data has been generated with single-arm trials also very encouraging, including with tucatinib and T-DM1 which is 
why we've proceeded to start another Phase 3 trial. But until we see the data, it's really – we can't really make any 
statements about what the potential treatment effect would look like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
What I can say, Tazeen – one thing I can add is that you've seen a lot of data sets come out from other trials. And 
when you look at PFS in this type of population, it's always measured in terms of months. So the first thing I can 
tell you from that, whenever I see that in my decades of doing cancer work, it says to me loudly, unmet medical

need. So we're in an area where patients need something. They don't just walk away saying, yey, there's drug X 
or Y, I'm cured. It's not where it is. We're talking a lot of these patients. They get a drug and respond for measured 
in months. So we have a really big important area to go into.
And when you have brain metastasis, which literally half the patients get, there's not anything really out there. So 
it's a grim prognosis, and we're trying to really do a good job and help patients and work on this drug. So, data, it's 
coming soon sometime this year. We are incredibly excited. And I'll remind you, we really loved all the data from 
single-arm trials. We just thought they were outstanding and this was the right drug, but we do not yet have the 
randomized data. And FDA rightly wants in this setting, with all the other drugs, they want to see randomized 
data, and we're up to that challenge and we're looking forward to reporting it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tazeen Ahmad
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Okay. And then just on safety, Clay, to wrap that up. How are you thinking about diarrhea rate? Do you think that 
that's an important differentiator in this population, or is that as you said when you have PFS and the mumps that 
this is a high unmet medical need area and any improvement is a good improvement?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I would go back to our early data on this drug because, obviously, we have not reported data from this pivotal trial. 
And early data shows a dramatic difference in any GI toxicity. You just don't bind EGF receptor. I'll remind you 
that both the first two HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors that were approved both bind to HER2 and inhibit the 
tyrosine kinase, but both of them bind to EGF receptor. And I don't believe that they were screened to not bind to 
EGF receptor. I think they were screened specifically for the HER2 TKI activity.
Whereas tucatinib was screened with not only getting something potent for HER2 TKI, but screened that it didn't 
bind to EGF receptor. So this is what's unique about this drug. And if you look at the safety profile for literally 
hundreds of patients that were treated in single-arm trials, it's – from a standpoint of comparison to the others that 
are out there, it's pretty dramatically different. So I think that I felt very confident about its safety profile where we 
just didn't know is in a randomized trial versus active competitor, how would you – how would it come out.
And Roger, do you want to add anything to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
No, I do. So I think just as a case in point around the safety profile, I'll just remind you that HER2CLIMB is a 
placebo-controlled trial. And in general, placebo-controlled trials can only be done if you're unable to tell which 
drug you're on, placebo or the active agent. So that's an important point to remember.
And secondly, in a disease like breast cancer which is a chronic disease, tolerability is key. If you're taking a drug 
twice a day and you can't take it for too long, it's not just, is it a safety issue, it can potentially feed into efficacy as 
well. So I think those two points are worthy of some consideration.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Willey with Stifel.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really good quarter. Just a quick question on PTCL and 
then one on tucatinib. So, just curious to what extent screening for CD30 expression may or may not represent 
the rate-limiting step for ADCETRIS right now in PTCL, either from just the utilization or reimbursement 
perspective. And I guess, how does the recent data demonstrating that the ADCETRIS benefit is agnostic to 
CD30 expression potentially change that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, certainly at ASCO, you saw the presentation from the docs that said that they had responses whether patients 
were CD30 high or CD30 low or even CD30 without even be able to – through histology be able to see it. Now, 
when you – historically, we've looked at all these patients, and you could look on with histology. Histology has a 
very big gray area background noise, so when you get down to lower levels of CD30, it's impossible to know 
whether it's positive or negative. You could just say histology negative, but that doesn't mean negative.
When you look at molecularly, and it's – we're hard pressed to find a lymphoma that's – a T-cell lymphoma that's 
CD30 negative when you look at it molecularly. And also, CD30 is an activation antigen, and it kind of goes up 
and down. And when you look at different nodules, you can even find different amounts of CD30 within the same 
patient. So it is a very complicated scenario where the prediction would be that all patients respond because 
CD30 is there and all and can go up and down; and in fact, that is exactly what the doctors showed in their 
presentation at ASCO. So I think, to the utility of it in different subtypes and based on all our data and everything 
we know, I think we have a really good case there that doctors should use this and it could benefit patients. So I 
certainly don't think that hurts.
And you had a second question on tucatinib?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Yeah. Just a quick follow-up on that then. I guess, if there were a mechanism by which you could remove that 
CD30 expression requirement from the label, would that change the narrative of uptake, do you think?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
What our requirement on there is it's CD – I mean, in Hodgkin lymphoma, it's not there at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
And in T-cell lymphoma, it just says CD30 positive, so it's not like – I mean, it could be a trace of it and be 
positive. So we don't find it as an impediment at all, quite frankly.

Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Okay. And then just for clarification on tucatinib, I know that you're talking about another study here in 
combination with T-DM1 in the second line, I just want to clarify if the initiation of that trial is contingent upon 
HER2CLIMB data.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Roger, do you want to comment on this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
No, it's not. We believe it's the right time, tucatinib, all the properties we've described. This is again a validated 
pathway, and we've generated the Phase 1 data which supports the combination, and we think it's the right time 
to proceed in that direction.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shanshan Xu with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Shanshan Xu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Thank you for squeezing me in. I have one question for Roger. If the upcoming readout of HER2CLIMB is 
positive, how should we think about expanding indications beyond breast cancer for tucatinib? And I have one 
follow-up for EV.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Thanks for the question. So, as we are now, we have tucatinib being incorporated into us by looking at new 
adjuvant applications. You see HER2CLIMB in the multiply-treated population. We're now moving into second-line 
metastatic breast cancer. We have an investigator-initiated trial called MOUNTAINEER, which has data 
combining tucatinib together with Herceptin in a third-line plus colorectal cancer population. We hope to have that 
data out later this year.
I think we – again, if tucatinib turns out to be the potential best-in-class, it realizes its potential, then anywhere that 
a TKI can have a role in a HER2-expressing tumor is where we want to go. So that includes CRC. It includes 
other stages of breast cancer, potentially gastric cancer. There are other cancers that HER2-expressing that 
could be of interest as well. So I think if we have a real molecule here, we will flesh out the development plan as 
appropriately fully as we can.

Yeah, absolutely.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
...proposition for a breast cancer oncologist if our data turns out the way we think it could with HER2CLIMB to 
have a tablet that's well-tolerated and really works. I think this would be a really important drug and will get a lot of 
use and will be in many different lines of therapy in breast cancer and outside of it.
So, go ahead. You had an EV question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Shanshan Xu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Yeah. I absolutely agree with your commentary on tucatinib. One follow-up on EV. So we witnessed the very 
impressive data of EV in EV-201, which is a third-line trial. In EV-201, the median OS is only two to three months 
shorter than the standard of care in frontline urothelial carcinoma. So I believe this is actually in everyone's 
interest to move EV into the pivotal trial of the frontline urothelial carcinoma. In the past ASCO, we saw that it took 
CALGB 90601 almost five years to achieve a full enrollment. So, Roger and Clay, what are potential drivers to 
accelerate enrollment for frontline urothelial carcinoma trial for EV? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
First of all, I want to make a commentary before getting to your question on EV. We have not had a single 
question from any analyst or comments from any analyst to the speed with which we submitted EV. We busted 
our back and submitted this much faster. We guided that it will be submitted sometime this year, and in July – and 
we submitted it in the middle of July. So this is months ahead of where most of you had in your models. I think 
most of you had it sometime in the middle of fall in your models. So I would like the analyst to notice that, which I 
think will translate into getting this product on the market faster. And it's an important product that doctors are 
screaming for. So this is part and parcel into we're trying to make a difference in patients' lives and we, together 
with Astellas, worked like morning, noon, and night on getting this to a submission because it's important, okay. 
This isn't just a Wall Street thing, it's a patient thing. And so I want everyone to notice how fast we worked on this.
Secondly, we are excited about the potential of EV in frontline, and there's lot of different approaches. Roger, do 
you want to give context to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So if you look – you can look back into the EV-103 trial and you can understand what our potential choices 
are. If EV is the backbone with a PD-1 inhibitor plus, minus chemotherapy, those are the types of choices that 
we're facing. And let's say I agree with you that the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer is still a high unmet need.
I think, personally, if we come up with a very thoughtful considered acceptable trial design, the excitement around 
the combination of EV with other drugs, once we have that data presented, if it supports that, will drive a lot of the 
enrollment. Bladder cancer has changed because all of the immunotherapies have come in, and there's a lot of 
interest now in bladder cancer. Docs are focused on moving trials ahead whereas in past times where there was

really just chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, not an interesting question, not an exciting question to answer. 
That's possibly why the CALGB trial was so slow. I would hope that we would be way quicker than anything like 
that.

Operator, we'll take our next question, please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andy Hsieh with William Blair, please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations to the Seattle Genetics team. It's nice to see that 
inflection point commercially. So, I have two questions. One is probably for Roger. So, could you remind us the 
specificity and potency of tucatinib, specifically pertaining to HER2 mutants? And if that is a potential differentiator 
versus other oral TKIs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Andy. We're interested in the mutant population. We haven't studied it, so that's 
something that we need to potentially move forward on. Tucatinib is very similar to neratinib in terms of its HER2 
selectivity and potency. They are very close. So the ability to inhibit the target with tucatinib is as good as any 
other – as sort of – the most potent inhibitor currently available, which is neratinib. Again, coming back to the 
HER2 mutants, we're interested again. Anywhere where there's a potential role for tucatinib, we need to signal 
fine. So that's for our future efforts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Andy, we believe that – and this is based on data like with Herceptin for instance, but in HER2 TKIs, when you 
keep pressure on a tumor in a patient, the patient does better. And that's what you see with other agents. And one 
of the things about these HER2 TKIs is that they're really toxic, you can't keep pressure on the tumor, you have to 
discontinue and not enable them to get therapy. So it's not – as Roger said before, it's not just a safety issue, it 
also relates to efficacy, and that's what we saw when we did a lot of diligence on this. We saw that this could 
change the paradigm and raise the bar, and allow for a TKI to keep pressure on the tumor for a substantive period 
of time. And that's really what's important.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Okay. Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up, and this pertains to EV. So, most of the time when you go from early 
Phase 1b to Phase 3 of any pivotal studies, you take some sort of response rate PFS duration penalty. Just 
curious, have you identified kind of any factors that contributes to just the impressive consistency across the 
early-stage [indiscernible] (01:05:44) analysis and the EV-201 top line results?

I will tell you that the clinical team at Seattle Genetics, and as certainly had been the case prior to Roger joining, 
but even emphasized more with Roger, is we don't want to get too overexcited about Phase 1 data unless we do 
a blinded third-party reviews and things like that. So we want to look at not just responses; we look at confirmed 
responses.
So when you see Seattle Genetics data from Phase 1 and it says confirmed responses, the chance that that will 
repeat in a bigger study is pretty high because these have already been stared at, where I see a lot of times 
companies put out data and they're unconfirmed responses, and then you see them later and it's a much smaller 
response rate and much less duration and all these things. And that's because they weren't as fastidious as we 
are. We're more interested at this point, or at all points in
Seattle Genetics' history, we've been interested in actually making substantive improvement in patients' lives with 
unmet medical needs, and not just getting a little bit of hype on some drugs. So we want the real data out there. 
And I think that's what contributes to our early-stage data matching pretty closely to the pivotal because we do it 
the same way with the same rigor.
Roger, any addition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. Two other comments. So, firstly, good drugs really work. And when they really work, they really work again 
and again. That's certainly one part of this. The other is, just bear in mind, the sample sizes are not 10 patients or 
20 patients; we're talking 100 plus. And so the variability around those confidence intervals is much smaller than a 
very small sample size where you can potentially get yourself misled. So it's great that the data is reproducible. 
You're right, many times that Phase 1 experience, as Clay described, degrades over time and that's obviously not 
something that anyone likes to see. But certainly with EV, we have not had that experience. And so it does bode 
well for the future of the drug.

Silvan Türkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter and the submission. Could you please give us a 
little bit more color on your pre-launch activities for EV outside of the sales force, such as maybe interactions with 
payers you have? And also, is there any strategy that leaps out at you in terms of how you can rule this out 
quickly in terms of what centers to target?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
First of all, I will thank you for the question. I mean, I – we are putting in a very large amount of effort on our prelaunch activity for EV, and it's across the board in lots of different areas. I mean, this is – this chart is the real deal. 
So we're not going in for a soft launch, we're going in for the full launch. No soft launch here in EV for sure.

Robin, you want to put this in context?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah, certainly, Clay. Like any new product launch, you need to be prepared for everything that you're going to be 
doing at at approval. And as you say, that's not just preparing the sales force in terms of the training materials. It's 
also understanding the payer environment, it's preparing the rest of the organization, and also outside of 
commercial. So, on the medical side, our medical affairs organization will be prepared. And, of course, we've 
been preparing for months already and even more than a year in terms of thinking through the brand strategy and 
how we're actually going to position this product in the market. And so all of these elements and I think what I said 
is that in my experience in oncology launches, what I saw coming into Seattle Genetics is a team that is very 
prepared. I was really impressed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Silvan Türkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Q
Great, thanks. And do you expect an AdComm?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
We can never make a comment on whether there's an AdComm or not. It's not our decision. But we do have 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and I think that – I don't want to handicap this actually, but we're thinking 
pretty positively about this drug.
Roger, any addition?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Agree. I agree.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Silvan Türkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Q
Okay. Thanks. And maybe just quickly for tucatinib. I think the brain metastasis will be very important, and it's 
great that you're studying it. What – do we have seen any data on activity in brain metastasis to date and earlier 
trials? And will this data be top line the same time you may put top line the PFS of the entire trial? Will it be 
mature enough at that point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So there has been data early on in looking in single-arm trials, not in a randomized setting, at brain metastasis. 
And with relatively really nice data, that was something that stuck out at us as we reviewed this, that we were 
surprised with – not surprised, but we were pleased, I should say, we're seeing the data in brain mets that we did 
with the single-arm trial. Yes, you have to do this in a randomized trial to prove it, but the data in brain mets was 
well – was better, considerably better than you would have expect to see in populations of brain met patients 
based on looking at other drugs and historic studies, but you have to do the randomized studies. So that's that.
Roger, any other comments on this?

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I agree, Clay. So the data we generated, clearly tucatinib is active in brain metastasis. That, I think, is no doubt. 
And so it's a matter of how active in the combination that we're testing. With regard to what will release top line, I 
don't think we'll get into any specifics about what data would be obtained in in that release.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. That's too premature to say what will in fact be released now. Our goal would be to release everything that 
we possibly can while retaining the ability for doctors to present this at an appropriate peer-reviewed large 
conference. And, I mean, breast cancer work is normally presented at conferences such as the San Antonio 
meeting which specializes in breast cancer, but also is at ASCO and ESMO and some other cancers. But the San 
Antonio conference is clearly the premier breast cancer conference, or it's evolved to being the premier breast 
cancer conference, didn't used to be that way but it is now.

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Amber. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal first quarter 2019 
results. As you know, it's been a busy few months for me at Palo Alto Networks and I'm delighted to report that we 
had another outstanding quarter. And once again we have been able to grow our top line significantly faster than 
the market.
I'm also happy to say that my cybersecurity education is progressing nicely as I continue to meet more customers, 
partners and employees. During this quarter, we held our first-ever European Ignite, our user event, in 
Amsterdam and our second annual Federal Ignite event in Washington, DC.
At these events for our customers and partners, we consistently heard from multinationals to governments all the 
challenges that are associated with protecting data in a digital world. Mobility, the movement of data to the cloud, 
data analytics and machine learnings are some of the trends that we believe are forcing companies to re-evaluate 
their security posture in a more comprehensive manner, looking for high levels of integration and automation.
In this way, we believe we are uniquely positioned to support our customers across all these three events: One, 
securing their enterprise; two, enabling them on their journey to the cloud; and three, helping them with their 
desire to deploy advanced AI and ML across their enterprise.
But let's discuss some current examples of how we're solving customer problems and what we have in store. 
Service provider is a segment where we have traditionally not done as well as we would like. We're about to 
change that. We're excited to announce a new product for our service provider partners, an area we plan to focus 
on and invest in for future growth. Our service providers are facing a major mobile infrastructure transition from 
4G to 5G. We want to be there with them to help them succeed.
We're announcing a new super-scale next generation firewall, the [ph] K2 Series (04:53) that has been developed 
specifically for service providers with their high-throughput needs, taking into account their price considerations, 
their upcoming 5G and IoT transition. We expect it will be available shortly in early 2019.
In a segment where we've done well, the federal space, WildFire, our cloud-delivered malware analysis service, 
achieved FedRAMP Ready status during fiscal Q1. This extends our ability to provide advanced threat prevention 
analysis capabilities to U.S. federal agencies.
For our largest customers, we introduced Panorama Interconnect. The new Panorama plugin gives customers the 
ability to manage the configurations of over 30,000 next-generation firewalls from a single Panorama console. 
And they can push configuration changes to all managed devices from one single location. This continues our 
quest to simplify large-scale security management for our customers.
And lastly, in cloud security, we closed our RedLock acquisition this quarter. RedLock adds to our already 
extensive set of cloud security offerings, which include Evident, Aperture, GlobalProtect cloud services and VMSeries. By combining the Evident/RedLock technologies, we'll provide customers with cloud visibility and 
compliance, cloud security and analytics and advanced threat detection in a single offering to be released very 
early next year.
The new offering will help security teams better understand their cloud deployments, detect and respond faster to 
the most critical threats and achieve automated remediation.

I know there's a lot of discussion around our philosophy and my philosophy on M&A, so I'd like to use the subject 
of RedLock to refine our point on the M&A philosophy.
The technology required is best-in-class. We have a clear opportunity to be a leader in this space, and we believe 
that we can significantly enhance the value of the assets we acquire. We invest in a product-focused team and 
technology that we believe we can integrate quickly and effectively into our infrastructure. I want to reiterate that 
as a shareholder and as an investor, my interests are aligned with yours to create long-term shareholder value.
To give you some guidance, any activities in the area of M&A are going to be disciplined. They're going to be 
guided by aspiration to, one, participate in a large market; two, become number one or number two in that market; 
and three, bring the vast execution capability of Palo Alto Networks to any acquisition, so that we can instantly 
enhance value.
Looking forward, we will continue to stay strong in network security, adding capabilities to solve our customer 
problems. Additionally, we will lean forward into the trends of cloud, machine learning and AI in a big way. These 
important technologies paired with our vision of simplifying security and providing a platform with consistent 
protection across an enterprise environment, is resonating with customers.
The Application Framework and XDR are the next step in our evolution towards this goal. We're making good 
progress under the leadership of our founder, Nir Zuk. And while we're still in the early days, during Q1, seven 
partners launched applications of framework. The technologies these partners bring to the framework include 
analytics, MSSP, identity, threat intelligence, security for industrial control systems, IoT and network access 
control.
Before I move on, I'd like to add a little bit more color on my first 180 days. As we all know, execution has been a 
key variable in our success as a company and will continue to be so in the future.
During the last earnings call, I mentioned launching speedboats with focused leadership accountable for results in 
our more nascent market opportunities. Whilst we have a great execution machine, we want to make sure our 
speedboats give us the flexibility to operate and execute effectively in some of the newer areas.
Our first speedboat in cloud security has been launched and is off to a good start. We have product and sales 
leaders jointly driving our cloud performance, and we expect this focus will allow us to execute as well in new 
areas as we have done historically. We'll likely launch additional speedboats in the future and will keep you 
posted on our progress.
We have an excellent go-to-market engine that is running well. And with our new President, Amit Singh, we have 
a leader in place who brings extensive experience growing enterprise and cloud businesses driving revenue and 
scale. Amit joined us on November 1 and has been extremely busy in his first few weeks on the job. He's finished 
over 50 account reviews, met as many customers already this quarter to both share our commitment to them and 
learn from our customers on how we can best partner with them.
He is running hard, and I'm excited that we found such a capable leader to fill this important role. He joins a great 
team. And together they will remain focused on executing against our significant market opportunity and 
momentum across the platform.

In our fiscal Q1, the team lived up to their reputation as we once again acquired new customers at a rapid rate 
and expanded our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers each spent a minimum of $33.6 
million in lifetime value, which is a 45% increase over the $23.2 million they did in Q1 of fiscal 2018.
Examples of customer wins and competitive displacements in fiscal Q1 that demonstrate the progress we're 
making across the network endpoint and cloud are, we landed a top three airline in the U.S. to secure their data 
centers. We also replaced a competitor in the data center and sold of our Traps subscriptions at a U.S.-based 
investment management company. Our cloud firewalls, VM-Series, was selected as a security standard on one of 
the world's largest networking and telecom companies in the world. Our cloud monitoring and compliance offering, 
Evident, was selected to secure the public cloud infrastructure on one of the largest banks based in Europe.
GlobalProtect Cloud Service was selected to secure remote factories, offices, and stores, one of the world's 
leading manufacturers and marketeers of quality skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. No points 
for guessing who that is. And our advanced endpoint protection offering, Traps, was selected to protect 10,000 
devices at a leading healthcare provider in Australia.
To round out the news in the quarter, we were happy to be positioned as a leader for the seventh consecutive 
year in Gartner's 2018 Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls. This positioning reflects our commitment 
to staying ahead of a certain landscape and providing our customers the best protection against the ever-evolving 
threat of cyberattacks.
I personally remain extremely excited about the opportunity ahead of us and plan to keep my head down and 
continue to execute with our leadership team. I'd like to thank our customers and our partners for their support, 
and, of course, the team at Palo Alto Networks for their dedication to our mission. I've really enjoyed becoming 
more established at Palo Alto Networks and learning about cybersecurity and working with this great team. I wake 
up every day excited to be part of this great company.
With that, I am going to turn the call over to Kathy.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings, all financial figures are nonGAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior-year periods unless stated otherwise. All current and prior 
period financial discussed are reflected under ASC 606 as we adopted the new standard as of August 1, 2018.
As Nikesh indicated, we had a great start to our fiscal year. We continue to see healthy security spending and 
strong demand across our platform. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 31% to $656 million. By geography, Q1 
revenue grew 29% in the Americas, 35% in EMEA and 35% in APAC. Q1 product revenue of $240.5 million grew 
30% compared to the prior year.
Q1 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $231.3 million increased 37%. Support revenue of $184.2 million 
increased 24%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $415.5 million increased 31% year-over-year and 
accounted for 63% of total revenue. Q1 total billings of $758.5 million increased 27% year-over-year. The dollar 
weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter was approximately three years, 
consistent with what we have seen in prior periods.
Total deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 34%. Q1 gross margin was $76.7%, 
relatively flat to last year. Q1 operating expenses were $366.5 million or 55.9% of revenue, which represents a

140-basis-point improvement year-over-year. Q1 operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 150 basis points 
year-over-year. We ended the first quarter with 5,645 employees. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter grew 
64% to $115.4 million, or $1.17 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss declined 39% to 
$38.3 million or $0.41 per basic and diluted share.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments 
of $3.8 billion. Q1 cash flow from operations of $252.3 million declined by 8%. Free cash flow for the quarter was 
$218 million. During the quarter, we redeemed $327 million of the $575 million 2019 converge. For GAAP 
accounting, $52.3 million of the amount redeemed is categorized as cash flow from operations. Adjusting for this 
and other cash charges, free cash flow in the quarter was $275.4 million, up 27% at a margin of 42%. Capital 
expenditures during the quarter were $34.3 million. DSO was 58 days, a decline of 12 days from the prior-year 
period.
Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For fiscal Q2 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $675 
million to $685 million on an ASC 606 basis, an increase of 24% to 26% year-over-year. We expect second 
quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.22, also under ASC 606 using approximately 99 million 
to 101 million shares.
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes 
expense of $10 million to $15 million associated with our recent acquisitions. Also included is our expectation of a 
$0.01 to $0.02 impact associated with U.S. tariffs on Chinese origin goods. As we continue to retire the 2019 
convertible debt through maturity in July, we expect approximately $45 million of the remaining $248 million 
balance to be accounted for as cash flow from operations. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain 
at 22%. CapEx in Q2 2019 will be approximately $25 million to $30 million.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It looks like our first question will come from Ken Talanian with 
Evercore ISI.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Talanian
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So first off, could you give us a sense for what if any changes you have made 
to your go-to-market efforts on the firewall side? And I'm thinking of that inclusive of the channel.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Thanks, Ken. Thanks for your question. We haven't made any particularly major changes to our go-to-market on 
the firewall side that I can think of or including channel. I think the efforts continue to be the same. Dave, is there 
anything you – please...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Peranich
Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yep, Ken, it's really been business as normal on that front. The sales team is enthused and highly engaged. 
We've got the industry-leading product. We've got great traction and great markets in front of us to grab, and we 
feel great about that business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Talanian
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q
Okay. And as a second question, could you give us an update on your traction with GlobalProtect Cloud and how 
you would characterize your win rates there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Hey, Ken. On the GlobalProtect Cloud front, we think we have a unique opportunity. As we see people trying to 
go ahead and automate and put security and come up with a new architecture for their remote branches and for 
their remote offices, we think see GPCS is a unique product which does really well.
We've had some good success with some very large players. We'll share more about the success in our next 
quarterly call. But, for now, again, it's an interesting product. It's unique in the way that allows our existing 
customers at Palo Alto Networks to be able to extend their network security, which they already have in the data
centers off to their remote branches without having to change the management control system, et cetera. So, 
really exciting. We're seeing a lot of traction. And hopefully, we'll tell you more about it next quarter.

Matthew George Hedberg
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Nikesh, in your prepared remarks, you talked about an increased focus on 
the service providers segment, which is great to hear. It sounds like there's a new product coming early next year. 
There's obviously a lot of drivers here. You mentioned a couple of them, including 5G. I guess, I'm wondering can 
you give us a little bit more detail on how this new product portfolio might accelerate the momentum there, and is 
there anything else from a go-to-market perspective that needs to be also augmented.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Matt, thanks for your question. Let me give you a very high-level point of view, and then I'll have Lee jump in and 
give you some more insight into why we believe this product meets the needs for the future for our service 
provider customers. It's a segment when I came here I realized we haven't done as well as we'd have liked to do. 
And there is structural reasons for it. There's reasons on the service provider side for it, but that's not enough of 
an answer.
So we sat down and looked at what we should be doing, what we can do, and the product team really rallied hard 
the last six months to be able to pull this together because we believe we already had the industry-leading firewall 
from a security and networking perspective. We just needed to make sure we were emphasizing some of the 
features that our service providers need in the future. So from that perspective, I think, the team has done a 
phenomenal job in getting us ready.
Now, remember, the sales cycles with service provider are long. So you're not going to be hearing us blow the top 
off from a sales perspective in three months. But this is a prerequisite for us to be strong in that sector. We have a 
very dedicated go-to-market team in the SP space. That's one of our few spaces where we have a dedicated 
team around the world. And they're very excited about this new product.
And I'll let Lee jump in and talk about why this product is relevant from a 5G, IoT and a next-generation 
perspective for those service providers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks, Nikesh. When we look at what's happening in the transition from 4G to 5G, there's some really 
significant changes that are taking place. The first is just the advent of IoT becoming really high-scale on mobile 
networks with the capability that 5G offers.
Second is a lot of that is going to be high value IoT. It's going to be medical device use cases. It's going to be 
connected cars. It's going to be things that are really important.
And the third is more and more applications are moving into these mobile environments. And so when we think 
about that, you can just imagine the need for the best security all of a sudden becomes a critical driver for this 
change from 4G to 5G. And so our timing of bringing out the new [ph] K2 Series (22:07) is aligned with this big 
shift in the SP space for this move to 5G.

That's great. Maybe one other for Lee. On the product side, obviously, RedLock seems like a great acquisition, 
really complementary to everything you've done, I think specifically what I can tell from Evident.io, maybe a bit 
more color there. I guess, it shares a sort of – it's an API framework, so it looks like it's going to be a nice 
integration. But maybe just a little bit more detail on how that sort of supplements what you guys have done there, 
including continuing to build out that side of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
I think, Matt, that's a great question. I think as I walked around and talked to a lot of customers, it was evident that 
– no pun intended – that every one of our customers was undergoing some sort of journey towards the cloud. And 
different shapes and forms, some people have a public cloud instance, some people are analyzing it, some 
people are trying to decide.
And many of them talk of a hybrid environment or a multi-cloud environment, because none of them is quite yet 
sure where they want to land in the long term. And as we went around and understood that journey, we 
understood that they need a multi-cloud security platform that allows them to carry their security posture from their 
existing data centers and their existing infrastructure into the cloud.
And as we looked at that, we thought we had a product in the space called Evident, which was leading in its own 
way, in its own category. But we looked at the market and said RedLock also was nipping at our heels and was 
also sort of doing really well in adjacent parts of the same market. And thought a good offering would be the 
integration of the two.
And to the credit of our Evident and RedLock team, they will integrate in the next month and be able to have an 
integrated product in the market by the first week of January, which I think is phenomenal, given the base of that 
market and given the opportunity in that market. We believe this is the only product of its kind in the space. But, 
Lee, I'll let you talk more about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, absolutely. So one of the things we've seen when we talk to our customers and their journey to the cloud is, 
one, they're all going through this journey. But, two, almost 100% don't fully understand everything that they have 
in the cloud already. And so the combination of Evident and RedLock really gives us a great window into – and 
our customers a window into everything they have. So visibility, asset inventory.
Based on that, I think is in the next step, which is how to provide security analytics for that, ultimately, detect 
threats and respond to those threats. And Evident brought a certain aspect of that. RedLock brought another 
component. And as Nikesh said, we'll be integrating those two quite shortly into a single integrated offering.

We don't talk about product futures on these calls and don't make public announcements. The PA-7000 Series is

Okay. Fair enough. And then a question for Kathy. When talking to your sales team or your channel partners, do 
you feel like the enterprise buying cycle is perhaps more back-end loaded this year than it was last year as it 
relates to the calendar year-end enterprise budget flush?

Kathy Bonanno

Hamza Fodderwala
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Hi. This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just dig into just 
the security demand environment more broadly, heading into 2019. It seems like we've had pretty strong refresh 
activity in recent quarters. Where do you think we are in terms of the opportunity? Are we early innings still? Or 
middle innings? Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, in terms of refresh opportunity, we've talked about the fact that it's an important variable for us as our 
cohort size increases every year over our history, it becomes a bigger and bigger opportunity for us as time goes 
on. While it's an important variable, it's not the most important driver of our growth.
As you see, we continue to add customers at a very high clip every quarter, and our expansion opportunity within 
our existing customer base is quite significant. So relative to the numbers in our customer cohort of five or six 
years ago, just the opportunity within our existing installed base and the new customers that we're adding are 
really the primary driver of our growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hamza Fodderwala
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Got it. And just a follow-up question on that. So it seems like the RedLock acquisition was a pretty good one for 
you. It's gotten some good feedback from the partner channels that we talk to on that product. What other 
functionality gaps do you see from a cloud security standpoint that you still have to fill in? Do you think these 
could be addressed organically? Or are you looking at all options?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Look, public cloud security is obviously very important, and we're putting a lot of our weight behind that with 
VM-Series, which continues to do very well for in-line security with Evident/RedLock combination, which we 
believe is the leading solution for API-based security in public cloud, and with some of the enhanced or summated 
Traps over the last many months to include support for Linux, which is obviously the predominant operating 
system behind the applications that running the public cloud.
And so that combination of in-line security, API-based security, and host security, we believe, is the right 
approach and we feel very good about being in a position where we have leading solutions in all three of those.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi, guys. This is Keith on for Michael. Nikesh, you indicated several times that Palo Alto will be focused on 
utilizing security data. So does this mean that you want to enter the SIM market and with the automation aspect, 
what we call now the SOAR market? How should we think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
No, we have some very exciting products coming up early next year in XDR, which allows you to do some degree 
of investigation, some degree of remediation. We are looking carefully at what this entails. Our Application 
Framework will allow for SIMs and SOARs to run on top of it. So we believe that we will be able to provide a 
comprehensive solution to our end customers as long as we can deploy our firewalls and our endpoint agents 
more ubiquitously across our entire base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. So, just to piggyback on that, so without a major investment whether organically or inorganically, can you 
develop like the intellectual capital and the culture around analytics and data science if you decide to go that way 
near to kind of become a data-focused company or?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Well, we have a significant effort around analytics with our product Magnifier, which does a bunch of behavioral 
analytics which sits on top of the Application Framework. We have embedded ML people in almost every one of 
our product teams, albeit, it's small. But our intention is to keep beefing that up, because we believe machine 
learning is not just about taking a lot of data and trying to train it. Machine learning is about taking every product 
of yours, understanding the data that it gives you, understanding how you use that data to be able to create a 
better product to start with and then leverage the ubiquity of that product to improve the outcome for every 
customer. So we're embedding ML people across the board, across the company.
We also have analytics apps on our platform. And as we see the deployment of the Application Framework, as we 
see the uses, behaviors of customers, we'll decide which way – which arrows we need to put more work behind.

Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Kathy, you mentioned I think $0.01 to $0.02 impact in terms of Chinese tariffs, I had 
some discussion with [indiscernible] (31:40) question as to if we see something go further in terms of the trade 
war. Is there any concern about supply of products coming out of China and you have alternative sourcing if 
necessary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, it's important for us to remind everyone that we do manufacture our products in the U.S. There are some 
components that we source that are only available in China. And we are looking at a number of options in terms 
of being able to mitigate the impact of tariffs or ensure that we have dual-source opportunities. And so our supply 
chain management is always very aggressive in terms of ensuring that we have a number of options available to 
us. And we're doing the same in the current environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sterling Auty
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Great. And then, just one follow-up. Just strategically, how should we think about the subscription – the product 
subscription growth from here or subscriptions that are not attached to a physical appliance, so whether that's a 
virtual firewall, et cetera, moving forward? How should we think of the growth dynamic there versus some of the 
physical product sales as you talked about service provider and other strategies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Well, we've talked historically about the non-attach business being at $274 million run rate as of Q4 of 2018, 
growing at 68% year-over-year. And so we are – these are newer markets for us where we're seeing very nice 
growth in them. And Nikesh mentioned launching speedboats that we believe will help us to execute very well in 
these newer markets where we think we have great products particularly in the cloud space.
We've talked about the Evident and RedLock combination. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there. 
But obviously, the business of the firewall growth and the product growth and our attach description growth is 
extremely important as well. And we continue to focus there. And those areas are also growing very nicely for us, 
which is why we continue to be able to grow at rates above the rate of the market.

Saket Kalia
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe for you, Nikesh, you talked about some of the early 
partners on Application Framework. Can you just zoom out a little bit and can we talk about how customers are 
using Logging Service and maybe some of the next couple milestones that you look forward to that can help drive 
the App Framework opportunity?

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, I think part of the App Framework piece is, has always been of trying to collect the data once and use it 
many times across multiple applications, because today every cybersecurity solution that the customer sees 
requires some degree of intrusive probes into their infrastructure, whether it's the network, or the endpoint, or 
even their cloud security in some cases.
So the notion is, let's collect all the data at once and then use it multiple times for our multiple apps. Towards that 
end, for example, our Traps product is probably going to collect or collects almost 100 megabytes of data per user 
per month, which I think is probably 15 or 20 times higher than any other endpoint product in the market. So that's 
what allows the customers to be able to collect the data once and we can deploy multiple applications against it. 
That's how we're going to be able to deploy XDR for them.
And there's no reason why these customers need to have that data collection happen multiple times. Some 
customers are running 6 to 8 endpoints at the same time, because each endpoint is taking a sliver of data for the 
deployment in lifecycle of that endpoint is anywhere from three months to 12 months depending on the complexity 
of the customer and the locations of their employee base.
So in that context, we're seeing good progress when we deploy Logging Service with Traps or people use Traps 
Management Services in the cloud to be able to manage their endpoints around their enterprise. We're probably 
going to be able to leverage the same thing without any incremental sort of endpoint deployment for the same 
customer with XDR. We're going to offer that as a service on top of the Logging Service. Similarly, the products 
like Magnifier which use similar data to be able to deploy the sort of the application on top of data collection from 
firewalls and future endpoint.
So we're seeing the evolution of the Application Framework as an integration point across multiple solutions. 
We're starting with our own first. We want to make sure that our stuff works so there is proof in the pudding. And 
for me the key milestones are can we get multiple Palo Alto Networks apps to be useful without deploying multiple 
sensors into the customers' infrastructure and be able to turn them on extremely rapidly because this speed of 
deployment is a key component in the future for cybersecurity.
So as long as we believe we're headed down that track, I'm excited. As long as we can see other partners coming 
down and saying, well, this is interesting, we like the fact that you have all this data, we don't have to go deploy 
multiple sensors across our customer base or your customer base. They can just sit on top of this data. As long 
as there is an economic model, which allows them to utilize that data and there is customer consent, we're fine 
letting them use it.

Saket Kalia
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
That makes a ton of sense. Thanks for that. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Kathy, just a quick housekeeping 
question. Was there anything to note on the other income line, I guess, this quarter and last? It feels just a little bit 
higher than what we've seen historically. Just wondering if you can talk about some drivers there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Well, there are probably a couple of drivers. Number one, interest rates have been increasing and then number 
two we have a higher cash balance given the convert that we recently did.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Okay. Thank you very much. First question is for Nikesh or Lee. How did Traps do this quarter and can you 
perhaps provide an update on the integration of Secdo as part of your XDR approach?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Traps continues to do well. We added a lot. We added a lot of new customers, of course. As Nikesh 
mentioned, the new Traps Management Service which is a cloud-based service, the majority of these new 
customers are deploying using that service, which is great, because that ties into Logging Service and Application 
Framework and sets us up for some of the futures around things like XDR. And so on that topic, we continue to 
make good progress on the integration of Secdo.
As we have told you before, we believe that EDR is not sufficient. So the idea of doing detection response based 
off of single data source is not enough. We think that the endpoint data needs to be compliant with network and 
cloud data as well. And so we are actively working on that. And some of the endpoint data, we're getting more. 
We have network data. We have cloud data. And then, in parallel to that, we're making good progress on the XDR 
application, will run on top of that and use that data. And we're on track for early calendar 2019 to have that 
available.

Gregg Moskowitz

Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Lee. And just for Kathy, as you noted, your operating margins were up about 
150 basis points year-over-year. And so it seems that you're absorbing the incremental cost from Evident.io and 
Secdo quite well. And I know, of course, that you're not providing fiscal 2019 guidance. I'm just wondering,

though, if there are any unusually high investments that you're targeting at this time over the balance of the year,

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan F. Ho

Fantastic. So just wanted to start out with the reference that you made to the speedboats. Can you maybe give us 
a sense of what this entails? And maybe contrast that with your traditional approach?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, look. What happens when you have very successful large teams selling a large amount of revenue and you 
start a new product initiative, typically, some of those efforts get buried across a very large sort of team of 
functional organization. So what we've done is we've taken all the people who are focused on some of our newer 
product areas, put them on the same floor, go ahead and take them across functions and effectively created two 
leaders, one on the product side, one on the go-to-market side.
And they have carte blanche to move as fast as they'd like to move within certain guide rails. And this has really 
increased our agility and our speed both in terms of deployment of product but also decisions that they need to 
make on a customer-by-customer basis and from a go-to-market perspective.
And the early results are promising. On our cloud security space, it has really helped us. For example, the cloud 
security team is run by Varun Badhwar, who we brought on board as part of the RedLock acquisition. He's a CEO 
there. He's very excited. He's very motivated to keep driving the product strategy. And Dean Darwin, who is a 
longstanding member of the Palo Alto Networks go-to-market and business team, they're both partnering really 
well. Dean brings the capability to be able to deploy that product across our very large sales force that's just 
globally distributed.

Varun doesn't have to worry about that. Varun has to worry about continuing to build a market-leading product 
and going in partnership with Dean and making sure that some of our best customers sign up for the product.
So that's kind of like the model behind it. It's working really well so far for one of the product areas. We're working 
on carving out the next set of product areas. So we are almost onto our second, where we'll be able to carve out a 
team, which is going to focus on GPCS and Aperture as our second speedboat. I'm really excited about being 
able to do that, which will be driven by Adam [Geller] on our product side and René [Bonvanie], our CMO. So just 
trying to create speed and agility on the speedboat front.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan F. Ho
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Got it. That's helpful. Just wanted to also follow up on some of the newer developments with AWS and maybe 
your early thoughts in terms of what outposts and some of the newer impacts could have on the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, the good thing is that what AWS – and not just AWS, GCP, VMware [ph] and other, RAND (43:00) or Azure, 
all of them are trying to encourage customers to think hard about the cloud and get out of this model of, let me 
control my destiny by having my own data center. They're trying to convince people that we all need to go to the 
cloud.
Now, as people are going to the cloud, they're realizing that, yes, the cloud is a fantastic platform. It gives you low 
latency. It allows you availability, allows you to go scale globally very rapidly.
But it's very hard to think about cybersecurity in that context. And there's a whole set of conversation that come 
up about my data integrity, how do I move my security posture from my existing platforms to the future?
And that's where we think none of these cloud transitions are going to happen in a meaningful way unless 
customers are able to think about there's a secure transition. So our job is to make sure that we partner with our 
enterprise customers today and help them, the journey, as they make this cloud journey and transition. And there 
is a debate whether people are going to use AWS native security or GCP native security, or is there room for 
somebody like us.
And answer is yes, there is, because there is no – there is very few – no is never a good answer. But there's very 
few dedicated single cloud-only customers out there. Most customers are either hybrid customers. Most 
customers are multi-cloud customers. In which case, you need an independent cloud security partner who can 
help you across this myriad of platforms, because it's very hard for one native cloud provider to produce a multicloud hybrid and public cloud environment security provider.
So we believe that this is a huge space. We believe it behooves both us and AWS and GCP and Azure to partner 
in this journey, because it's beneficial for them and beneficial for us.
And honestly, like, security is a 2% or 2.5% spend across a cloud transition, maybe 3%. So they're not going to go 
try and compete with us in that 3% to 4% spend. I know I went from 2.5% to 4%, but it depends on the customer. 
I'd like it to be more, but it depends on the customer. So we think there's going to be – there is enough room for a 
partnership in this space.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Patrick Colville with Arete.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Colville
Analyst, Arete Research Services LLP Q
Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask about just core next generation firewall? What continues to differentiate 
you guys? Because you guys are crushing it and doing a great job. And just from your perspective, what 
continues to differentiate Palo Alto versus the competition to produce these results?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, in my six months that I've spent talking to customers and traveling around the world, trying to understand 
both why are customers buying us and what's differentiated in our product, I have to say at least the feedback I 
get from our customers is that there is a very clear differentiation around security.
Palo Alto Networks firewalls were built with security first in mind, and that's why, you heard us launch the service 
provider [ph] K2 Series (46:04) just now, because they balance both the throughput need to service providers as 
well as this high security requirements of 5G and IoT.
So we are a security-first sort of firewall, and that resonates with all of our customers. It's kind of the right time in 
the journey, because early cloud migrations or early data center migrations were a lot about moving your data 
there, now it's a lot about opening up the Internet. The moment people start opening up ingresses and egresses 
to the Internet in a large scale basis, you open the door for cybersecurity attacks or cyberattacks across your 
infrastructure.
At that point in time, every CIO, every CISO is concerned about making sure that their environment is protected. 
So security is becoming a more and more relevant topic on the agenda of CISO, CEOs and CIOs. And they turn 
around and say, do we have good security or not? And that's not a price-sensitive conversation. It's a securitysensitive conversation.
So from that perspective, I think, I can't take credit for this. This is the team here and the prior management, they 
did a phenomenal job in making sure we have people around the world, we have customers, we have gone ahead 
and worked with these customers all year. Some of the deals come into fruition now. The deals teams have been 
working on for 12 months, 18 months, 24 months. So this is a journey that has been started a while ago and it's a 
security-focused journey. And it is a product that is clearly differentiated in the marketplace, [ph] and we both, 
(47:27) given the more sensitivity around security, we will continue to take market share.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Colville
Analyst, Arete Research Services LLP Q
Got it. Got it. And can I ask in my follow-up another high-level question like that? So there's some investors are 
skeptical that an appliance company can transition to be more of a software company over time because history 
in technology over the last 30 years shows us that that can be quite difficult. Clearly, the numbers you guys are 
putting out in unattached subscriptions are very healthy with the growth momentum being very strong.

So the indicators for now that this transition is happening very effectively. But what gives you confidence that that 
can continue and that you guys can continue pivoting away from product and more towards subs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, I think whilst we look at it from an industry transition perspective, because some of us analyzed the industry 
and look at it from afar, if you ask the customer, for them it is a continuous spectrum. They see it as a continuous 
journey and they want to be able to take their existing partner with them through the journey. Because security is 
kind of a thing where your customers have to believe and trust in you that you are going to protect them.
We have many instances, many, many, many instances happen on a daily basis where the customers, we 
understand, reach us, they call us, we work with them, we show them how to protect themselves, we show them 
how to improve their security posture. So we built trust and reliability with over 50,000 customers around the 
world. And I think as we come out with new products, would a customer rather buy the next generation product 
from a small start-up of 40 people, or would they rather have the capability of a team that has been working with 
them for three to five years helping their security posture? We believe the latter. Look, I am sitting in the pit, 
working with the team for the last six months, 12-hour days, working hard on every product, every part of the 
transition. I'm convinced we can make the transition. So and as far as the skeptical investors, it's for us to know 
and for them to find out. By the time they find out, it will be too late.

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could characterize for us the level of 
sophistication, education that you're seeing around cloud security awareness from your customers. At this stage, 
how much of it is a push from Palo Alto where you really need to educate around the virtual firewall and 
GlobalProtect and Aperture and some of the cloud products that you have versus customers maybe reaching a 
consensus and realizing that in order to be secure in the cloud, they need more Palo Alto products? Thanks.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Thanks, Gabriela. That's a brilliant question because when we did the acquisition of RedLock and we looked at 
what we have at Evident, I realized we have an awareness problem. Many of the existing customers of AWS, 
GCP or Azure don't know what they need. And part of the effort in the last even few weeks and going forward has 
been to get in front of our customers, demonstrate the product to them, and it's about them saying, oh my god, 
yes, I do need this.

So you're right. There is not a flash realization across the space that we need this security, because these things 
are moving from the dev-ops team upwards into the enterprise. So there's a lot of awareness and education that 
is required. And hence, we are stepping up our efforts to do that education, to do the partnerships, to create the 
awareness. But we also believe, like I said earlier, we are the only player right now with a product of this 
sophistication and we intend not to lose the sophistication and leadership of this product.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
That's helpful. Thank you. And the follow-up is not specifically on the PA-7000 Series refresh. But I do want to ask 
how you're thinking about the cadence of appliance introductions at a higher level. If I think back to 2017, there 
were a number of product introductions on the appliance side. So just maybe some high-level thoughts on how 
you think about those introductions going forward and how much more [ph] flow (51:23) plays into that if at all. 
Thanks.

I'm sorry. Can you clarify your question? Appliance what?

Gabriela Borges
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
How are you thinking about the cadence of new appliance introductions at a higher level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David M. Peranich
Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, got it. Yeah, yeah, got it. So thank you. Look, our desire as we build our hardware roadmaps and overall 
strategy is, our large enterprise customers, or service provider customers in general they do not want to see 
hardware technology change too fast, because that necessitates the need for them to then go through and do a 
whole bunch of work to swap out old hardware for new hardware and things like that.
And on the flip side, of course, we want to stay very up-to-date on the latest and greatest technology in order to 
be able to provide the best products. So we're always balancing between those two aspects. And there is no 
single answer to it. It's just always looking for where the big technology inflections are on the hardware side and 
then looking at how we can slot those into a development schedule that makes a lot of sense to both us and our 
customers. What you've seen us do over the last couple of years is obviously introduce a number of new 
hardware platforms that have been very well received. And then where we need to, we'll continue that process of 
bringing to market new hardware technologies where we get a lot of bang for the buck and really help our 
customers.

Erik Suppiger
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Q
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions. One, Nikesh, how do you feel your channel is currently 
prepared for moving into the cloud? What kind of evolution do you need to see from your channel partners? And 
then secondly, on the service provider front, one of your competitors does a lot of development with the hardware 
with ASICs. Is that something that you would consider in order to achieve the performance that you need to meet 
service provider requirements for 5G?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So thanks for the question. I think – look, the channel...

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Perfect. Thank you. Erik, from a channel perspective, look, the channel is not one entity. Channel is very large set 
of partners where we have people who are very cloud-savvy and very cloud-ready and we have people who are 
going through their own journey of transitioning to the cloud, because they've been very hardware-centric. So they

come in different shapes and sizes. We're very excited about the partners who are stepping up and creating the 
cloud education focus within their own teams to be able a part of this journey.
There are some others who are called BICs, [ph] have one (54:32) called Born in the Cloud. So they are people 
who are focused exclusively on the SaaS space and working with us and other players in the SaaS space. So 
there is a transition going on in the channel as much as there is a transition going on in our customer base. And 
the channel is getting ready to be able to provide these capabilities to our customers.
So we see a very, very sort of healthy partnership going forward with the channel where they're going to end up 
providing a lot of services to our customers, getting a lot of education and awareness. Now the question Gabriela 
asked about how do we create the awareness across 50,000-plus customers of public cloud companies and get 
them to see our product? Can't do it alone with our smaller team on that scale. We're going to have to leverage a 
large distribution network, which is in place, which is service provider network. So I think that's kind of the answer 
for the first part of your question.
And as it relates to the ASICs and the throughput part, look, we believe in the [ph] K2 Series (55:25) product. We 
are going to match the price performance of everybody else out there from a throughput perspective. And we 
believe we're going to be industry-leading in security, in fact, the only ones in the industry who can deliver the 
security requirements for 5G and IoT. So we feel very comfortable with the new [ph] K2 (55:44) product.
As I said very early, their sales cycle in SP are long. But as we've announced this today, we're going to be 
launching efforts throughout our teams and our go-to-market teams to start approaching some of the largest 
service providers around the world. We're working with them to make sure they understand the capabilities of the 
effect of the next generation firewalls now and make sure that they keep us in consideration as they go towards 
their own journey of going to 5G and IoT.

Catharine Trebnick

Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Yes. Well, thank you, operator. Look, in closing, I'd like to thank you for your interest in Palo Alto Networks. I also 
would like to thank once again our customers, our partners and our employees for the tremendous amount of 
effort they put in to making sure that we're able to deliver our results.
I've been reading many of your notes and I know that some of you are still anxious to understand me. So before I 
wish you a happy holiday, I wanted to send out this invite to all of you who would like to come meet me. We're 
going to try and schedule over the next three weeks for sell-side analysts to come visit. If you reach out to Amber 
and our Investor Relations team, she can schedule it. That way, hopefully next time around when I read your 
notes, you won't be as anxious about me. I'm anxious enough about myself. I don't need you to be more anxious 
about me.
So with that, thank you again for your interest in Palo Alto Networks and goodbye.

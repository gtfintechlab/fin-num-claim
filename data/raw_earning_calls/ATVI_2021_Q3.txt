As I said during our last earnings call, I want Activision Blizzard to be the leader in our industry for workplace 
culture. Since then, the leadership team and I have been hard at work listening to employees and implementing 
meaningful changes. I'd like to review the actions we've taken over the past few months with you today.
As we have made clear in certain instances relating to workplace culture, we should have done a better job 
ensuring our values were embraced across all parts of the company. Over the last few years, we have been 
focused on the improvements that are necessary to become a model workplace. We are of course taking these 
actions because any single instance of wrongful conduct at our company is unacceptable. But these actions we're 
taking are also the right ones for our business success.
We can't achieve our business ambitions without the very best talent. People with the talents we need have more 
alternatives for highly paid work opportunities than ever before. If we don't constantly evolve as a great place to 
work, we won't retain or attract the talent we need to realize our tremendous potential.
As a company, we have more opportunities ahead of us than I've seen in almost all the years I've led the 
company. The success we've achieved thus far is a result of an overwhelmingly large number of extraordinarily 
talented people with high integrity and good values focused on delivering great games to our players, which has 
resulted in superior shareholder returns.
This company and many of its leaders and so many of our talented employees past and present have shown 
strength of will dedicated to the achievement of bold aspirations. Our commitment to make Activision Blizzard the 
most welcoming and inclusive company in the world will be accomplished the same way our industry leadership 
has been accomplished, focusing commitment, persistence, strength of will, the unwavering ambition of truly 
talented people with equally unwavering integrity, and the continuous commitments to improvement.
In September, we announced a comprehensive agreement with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission which is 
subject to court approval to strengthen policies and programs intended to further improve the prevention of 
harassment, discrimination, and related conduct. As part of this agreement, we'll establish an $18 million fund to 
compensate those who have experienced such behavior at our company.
With respect to pay equity, another critically important issue that we have always worked hard to ensure we 
achieve, we recently disclosed to employees the results of our review of 2020 pay equity at our company which 
was conducted by an independent research firm. The US analysis showed that women on average earn slightly 
more than men for comparable work in 2020, and we're committed to compensation remaining equitable for men 
and women performing comparable work, always.
Last week we also announced a number of important new workplace initiatives. We announced the zero-tolerance 
harassment policy company-wide. This includes tougher rules and greater consistency across the organization to 
make certain reports are always properly and promptly handled. Now, any Activision Blizzard employee found 
through our new investigative processes and resources to have retaliated against anyone for making a 
compliance complaint will be terminated immediately.
In many other instances of workplace misconduct, we will no longer rely on written warnings, terminations will be 
the outcome, including in most cases of harassment based on any legally protected category. Future employment 
contracts and equity awards will state that termination for these reasons will result in immediate forfeiture of future 
compensation.

Another is our pledge to increase the percentage of women and nonbinary people in our workforce by 50%. 
Today, approximately 23% of our global employee population identifies as women or nonbinary, so within the next 
five years, and hopefully faster, we will seek to increase our percentage of women and nonbinary professionals to 
more than one-third across the entire company. To further this commitment, we'll be investing in additional $250 
million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for 
underrepresented communities.
Additionally, based on feedback from many employees, we are waiving required arbitration of future individual 
sexual harassment and discrimination claims. That means for any employee who chooses not to arbitrate an 
individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination, or related retaliation arising in the future, the 
company will waive any obligation to do so.
As we report regularly on our progress and our financial results, you will continue to hear more about our 
workplace initiatives which we firmly believe will help us remain one of the world's most successful entertainment 
companies. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to each other, the company, and our 
players.
For those employees past and present who have been brave enough to step forward and share their stories, we 
continue to be committed to investigating all claims thoroughly and holding people accountable. For those 
employees who have shared feedback, thoughts, suggestions, concerns, and complaints, and there are many of 
you, we hope you can see from our actions that we are listening. We are evolving our organization through your 
ideas and active participation in their execution. And for those employees who have worked tirelessly to deliver 
great experiences to our players, your resilience in these challenging times is inspiring.
We expect that we'll continue to face challenging and negative media attention regardless of our progress, but we 
are determined to stay focused on providing great opportunities and the very best work environment for our 
talented employees to deliver the very best games for our players and to continue to provide superior returns for 
our shareholders. Thank you for your participation today.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Daniel to share the results of our operations for the last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel I. Alegre
President & Chief Operating Officer, Activision Blizzard, Inc.
Thank you, Bobby. Before I discuss our operating results, I want to take this opportunity to thank our incredibly 
talented teams across the entire company who share the passion to make exciting and ground-breaking 
experiences for our players all around the world.
Activision Blizzard's third quarter results were above our outlook. Our monthly active users and time spent in our 
content were consistent with the year-ago level even as regions continued to reopen, while net bookings and 
operating income grew year-over-year. This performance again illustrates the structural expansion in our largest 
franchises as we execute our strategy of delivering gaming experiences across new platforms with more regular 
content and leveraging multiple commercialization models including free-to-play.
Execution against this strategy enables us to grow our communities, including in geographies outside of our 
traditional regions, to deepen engagement and to create more opportunities for player investment. Critical to this 
is a continued investment in creative talent. We continued to grow our developer head count in the third quarter 
and have increased our development organization by hundreds of talented professionals year-to-date, including

announcing new studios and expansions in multiple new cities globally. This geographic diversification strategy is 
paying dividends, allowing us to tap into critical talent pools in all corners of the world.
As we grow our teams with new hires, we are keenly aware of the importance and responsibility we have to 
ensure a safe working environment for our people. This is our number one priority. Specifically, in recent months, 
we have taken actions that resulted in the departure of a number of individuals across the company. Additionally, 
we have seen increased competition in the market for our talent and higher voluntary turnover that has partly 
offset our success in hiring.
As we have worked with new leadership in Blizzard and within the franchises themselves, particularly in certain 
key creative roles, it's become apparent that some of the Blizzard content planned for next year will benefit from 
more development time to reach its full potential. While we are still planning to deliver a substantial amount of 
content from Blizzard next year, we are now planning for a later launch for Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV than 
originally envisaged.
These are two of the most eagerly anticipated titles in the industry, and our teams have made great strides 
towards completion in recent quarters. But we believe giving the team some extra time to complete production 
and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch will ensure that these releases 
delight and engage their communities for many years into the future.
These decisions will push out the financial uplift that we had expected to see next year, but we are confident that 
this is the right course of action for our people, our players, and the long-term success of our franchise.
Now, I will cover our third quarter franchise and operational highlights across our business units.
Starting with Activision, we had on average 119 million people engaged in our content monthly in the third quarter. 
Call of Duty continues to sustain reach, engagement, and player investment well above levels seen prior to our 
introduction of free-to-play experiences across console, PC, and mobile. Monthly active users in the franchise 
were consistent year-over-year on console, PC, and grew on mobile.
Console and PC engagement trends were consistent with typical trends as we moved away from the premium 
launch even as regions continued to reopen through the quarter. Console and PC MAUs and time spent exhibited 
very similar retention from Q2 to Q3, as our experiences in prior years.
In-game player investment on console and PC remained well above pre-Warzone levels at approximately three 
times the level of Q3 2019. And strong conversion from free-to-play drove premium sales higher than in any third 
quarter prior to the launch of Warzone.
And our teams are all set to launch the next phase of exciting new Call of Duty content for players worldwide. This 
Friday sees the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard, and on December 2 we will roll out Call of Duty: Warzone 
Pacific, the biggest update to the Warzone experience since launch.
As we've demonstrated with Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War, the release of Vanguard is just the first 
step in delivering the community an incredible amount of ongoing content, live engagement, and much more. 
Across campaign, zombies, multiplayer, and Warzone, there is no bigger experience or better value over the 
duration of the game's life cycle across our premium and free-to-play business.

And then we expect Warzone Pacific and its new Caldera map to take the free-to-play experience to another 
level. The premium and free-to-play experiences are more integrated than ever before, sharing the same engine, 
weapon integration, and content integration as well as Call of Duty standards of cross-play, cross-progression, 
and more.
Both titles are set to benefit from RICOCHET, a new anti– cheat technology aimed at addressing one of the key 
implements requested by the community. We are confident that our players are in store for an incredible set of 
experiences this holiday season and beyond.
On mobile, Call of Duty net bookings grew over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter driven by double-digit 
growth in the West and a continued contribution from the game in China. The team continues to refine the player 
experience, building on learnings from the title's first two years to optimize content, events, and features for our 
communities around the world.
And at the same time, we continue to ramp our teams working on new mobile title within the Call of Duty universe. 
In addition to hiring a substantial number of developers over the last quarter, we are pleased to announce last 
week the acquisition of Digital Legends, a Barcelona-based mobile game developer that will further bolster the 
world-class team we are assembling.
Turning to Blizzard, monthly active users were 26 million in the third quarter. For Diablo, our plan to deliver an era 
of unprecedented levels of content for the franchise has experienced a strong start with the September release of 
Diablo II: Resurrected, the return of one of the most acclaimed titles in PC gaming history.
The first week of sales of the title were the highest recorded for a remaster from our company, and we have seen 
strong ongoing demand particularly in Korea where the game is proving one of the most popular titles in internet 
game rooms. With such strong engagement, the team is now working hard to ensure that players have the 
smoothest possible experience as they explore the world of Sanctuary.
This is just the first step in Blizzard's plans for the franchise. On mobile, Diablo Immortal is in public testing and 
remains on track for release in the first half of next year. And with Diablo IV set to be the foundation for great 
experiences for PC and console fans over many years, we believe the pieces are in place to expand and serve 
the Diablo community better than ever before.
Turning to Overwatch, where millions of people continue to engage in both the game and the eSport, September 
saw the Grand Finals of the Overwatch League become the most-watched in league's history. Starting in the 
spring, the next season of Overwatch League will run on an early build of Overwatch 2's new 5v5 competitive 
multiplayer mode, giving the community a fantastic view into the development team's strong work on the next 
iteration in the franchise. And the team plans to follow this with new content and initiatives to engage existing, 
returning, and new Overwatch players next year.
Within the Warcraft franchise, World of Warcraft reach and engagement continues to benefit from the combination 
of the Modern game and Classic under a single subscription. The two games offer players more ways to engage 
and create more opportunities for our teams to deliver compelling experiences to fans of the franchise. With deep 
engagement across both Classic and Modern, WoW's overall subscriber base is stronger than we typically see at 
this point after a Modern expansion launch. And for 2021, World of Warcraft is on track to deliver its strongest 
engagement and net bookings outside of a Modern expansion year in a decade.

Our WoW team has been rolling out numerous quality of life improvements across the Modern and Classic games 
franchise in response to player feedback, and today the Modern game released its latest content update with 
Classic soon to launch for our servers with greater challenges to engage the passionate community.
Hearthstone net bookings were stable year-over-year in the third quarter, and in October the team launched 
Mercenaries, an innovative role-playing mode that gives the Hearthstone community an entirely new way to play 
the game. Initial results for Mercenaries have been very encouraging, and we believe Hearthstone is positioned 
for a return to year-over-year growth in net bookings in the fourth quarter.
Across the Warcraft franchise, our teams are working on a substantial pipeline of content planned for next year 
including new experiences in Classic and Modern WoW, more innovations in Hearthstone, and getting all new 
mobile Warcraft content into players' hands for the first time. Blizzard cannot wait to share more details on their 
plans.
The King business continues to deliver fantastic results with very strong year-over-year trends for both in-app 
purchases and advertising. MAUs were 245 million in the third quarter. King's deep capabilities of live operations 
are driving engagement for both existing and new players. Hours played across the King portfolio grew year-overyear in the third quarter with players responding positively to a more frequent cadence of compelling in-game 
content and events for key titles.
The team's prior actions to grow payer conversion alongside ongoing strong execution in user acquisition saw 
payer numbers growing by double-digit percentage versus the year-ago quarter. These initiatives drove over 20% 
year-over-year growth in in-game net bookings for Candy Crush with Candy once again the top grossing game 
franchise in the US app stores.
Additionally, at the end of the third quarter, King launched the All Stars U.S. tournament, a competitive event that 
saw Candy Crush Saga players battle to be crowned the ultimate Candy Crush All Star. The event has driven 
meaningful increases in installs, game rounds played, and in-app purchases in recent weeks highlighting 
competitive game play as another opportunity for franchise growth and our investment in the Candy Crush brand.
In addition to this innovation and success of Candy, for several quarters now King has been accelerating and 
refining content delivery in Farm Heroes, its second largest franchise. This work continued to bear fruit in Q3, and 
year-to-date in-game net bookings have grown around 20% year-over-year.
And finally, King's advertising business again grew robustly with quarterly revenue growing sequentially and yearover-year to a new high. Both volume and pricing grew strongly year-over-year, benefiting from the team's 
growing relationships with demand partners, and the ongoing ramp of new categories of advertisers.
In summary, Q3 saw solid year-over-year growth in the business, and we see substantial growth ahead for our 
portfolio of internally owned IP. While we have seen some slippage in the release schedule for specific titles at 
Blizzard, we cannot be more excited about our plans to unlock the full potential of our largest franchises and to 
drive meaningful expansion in our reach, engagement, and operating performance.
This is only possible because of our teams. I want to share an announcement about the leadership of one of 
those teams. Jen Oneal, who has been co-leader of Blizzard, has been a passionate advocate for bringing 
positive changes to the video gaming industry and has been doing so as board member of Women in Games 
International or WIGI, a nonprofit organization that cultivates and advances equality and diversity in the global 
games industry.

Jen has decided to leave the company at the end of the year, and we have agreed to support Jen in her 
involvement with WIGI by making a donation to WIGI in honor of Jen. In her remaining months for the company, 
given her commitment to this work, Jen will build the foundation of programs funded by the grant.
As such, Mike Ybarra will take on Jen's leadership responsibilities. It is great to see how employees at our 
company are committed to bring about the positive changes in our industry and beyond, and our leadership team 
stands behind these efforts.
Now, I will hand over to Armin who will provide more color on our financial results and outlook. Armin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Armin Zerza
Chief Financial Officer, Activision Blizzard, Inc.
Thanks, Daniel.
First, I'd like to reiterate that ensuring a workplace that provides opportunity for all in the most welcoming and 
inclusive way is our top priority. Today I'll review our third quarter results as well as outlook for the fourth quarter 
and full year 2021.
Our third quarter results were ahead of our prior outlook with year-over-year growth in net bookings, revenues, 
operating income, and EPS against difficult year-ago comparables. Importantly, each of these metrics have also 
grown year-over-year on a year-to-date basis. So, even as regions continues to reopen, our business is operating 
at significantly greater scale than that seen prior to our successful growth initiatives across our largest franchises.
Let me start with our consolidated financial results. Unless otherwise indicated, I'll be referencing non-GAAP 
figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.
Now, for the quarter, we generated quarter three GAAP revenues of $2.07 billion, $100 million above our August 
outlook. This includes net recognition of deferrals of $190 million. Net bookings of $1.88 billion, that’ s $30 million 
above our August outlook. And we generated quarter three GAAP EPS of $0.82 and quarter three non-GAAP 
EPS of $0.89 which was $0.14 above our guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of 
$0.17. Quarter three EPS included a $0.03 [ph] turn (25:21) from an unrelated loss on investment as well as a 
benefit from a lower than anticipated tax rate in the quarter.
Now, turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, quarter three operating cash flow was $521 million, more than 
double the year-ago level driven by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital movements. Our cash and 
investments at the end of September were approximately $10 billion, and we ended the quarter with a net cash 
position of approximately $6.4 billion.
Growing shareholder value through capital allocation is a key focus for us, and over the long-term investors 
should expect a balanced approach across investing in creative talent in our own business, strategic M&A, and 
returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.
Now let me turn to our segment results. Activision revenue was $641 million. Segment revenue was lower yearover-year, as expected in our outlook. This was due to the launch of Tony Hawk in the year-ago quarter and 
declines in Call of Duty upfront and in-game net bookings against the quarter that benefited from shelter-at-home 
mandates and the early ramp of Warzone. Year-to-date, net bookings for the Activision segment and the Call of 
Duty franchise were higher year-over-year with the franchise now consistently operating at greater scale than

before our free-to-play and mobile initiatives. Activision's third quarter operating income was $244 million, and 
operating margin was 38%.
Blizzard's revenue of $493 million grew 20% year-over-year driven by the successful launch of Diablo II: 
Resurrected. Year-to-date, net bookings for Blizzard and for World of Warcraft, its largest franchise, were higher 
year-over-year. Blizzard's third quarter operating income was $188 million with an operating margin of 38%.
King delivered another record quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $652 million. That's a new high. 
Third quarter in-game net bookings grew in the mid-teens year-over-year, while advertising grew approximately 
60%. King's third quarter operating income was a record $303 million with an operating margin of 46%.
The team’ s strong execution across live operations, marketing and advertising drove records for both revenue 
and operating income, both for the quarter and year-to-date. King's ability to delight and engage players with 
robust live operations provides a lot of learning that we we’ re trying to apply to both Activision and Blizzard and 
not just in mobile.
Looking across our segments, in-game net bookings were $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year and 
approximately $500 million higher than the level of quarter three of 2019. And during the third quarter, mobile net 
bookings grew over 20% year-over-year driven by the strength of both Activision and King. Consumer spending 
and advertising within our mobile content was almost $1 billion in the quarter, and we see substantial room for 
product growth as we take each of our key franchises to the largest and fastest growing platform, leveraging our 
creative and live operations capabilities for Activision, Blizzard, and King.
Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. With regard to our slate, in addition to 
ongoing live ops and in-game content across the portfolio, the fourth quarter will see Activision release Call of 
Duty: Vanguard this Friday, November 5, followed by the biggest Warzone update yet, Warzone Pacific, on 
December 2. Blizzard launched the new Mercenaries mode in Hearthstone in mid-October and will release the 
next Hearthstone expansion later this quarter. And King continues to support Candy Crush and other games 
across its portfolio with numerous seasonal events and new features.
Our team has done a phenomenal job building this content, even as many of them continue to work-from-home, 
and we can't wait for our players to get their hands on these experiences.
With that said, we remain prudent in our revenue assumption for the fourth quarter. And regarding costs, we have 
decided to further step up investment in mobile marketing given the strong returns we are currently seeing and 
[indiscernible] (30:24). We expect the earnings impact of these investments to be offset by lower tax rates, and 
we continue to expect full year earnings per share to be up strongly year-over-year and comfortably ahead of the 
outlook provided at the beginning of the year.
Now let me get into the specifics. For quarter four, on a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $2.02 billion 
including net deferrals of $763 million. We expect net bookings of $2.78 billion. We expect GAAP operating 
margin of 30%, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 785 million, and EPS of $0.54. For 
quarter four on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 25% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.62 including net 
deferrals of $0.67.
This means that on a GAAP basis for 2021 we now expect revenues of $8.66 billion including the net recognition 
of deferrals of $10 million. We now expect net bookings of $8.65 billion. We expect GAAP operating margin of 
37%, a GAAP tax rate of 18%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 784 million, and GAAP EPS of $3.27. For

2021 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a tax rate of 17% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.70 including net deferrals of 
$0.06.
With respect to risk, as you’ ve heard, we're taking action to address stakeholder concerns and the adverse 
consequences to our business from workplace issues. If we experience further adverse publicity regarding our 
company and executives, increased competition for talent, higher voluntary turnover, significantly reduced 
productivity, or other negative consequences relating to these issues, our business likely would be adversely 
impacted. We are therefore carefully monitoring all aspects of our business by any such impacts, and we're taking 
actions to help address them.
Now I'd also like to provide some updates on how we are planning for next year specifically. As a starting point, 
our business continues to operate at much greater scale, and we have clear line of sight to expanding the reach, 
engagement, and financial performance of our business further in the coming years as we apply the framework 
that has worked so well for Call of Duty and Candy Crush to other franchises in our portfolio.
At the same time, as Daniel described, we’ ve taken the decision to give the Overwatch and Diablo team the 
extra time they need to deliver the experiences that their communities deserve and to set the franchises up for 
maximum success over a multiyear period. We are therefore currently not planning for material contributions from 
Overwatch 2 or Diablo IV in 2022.
While this development will push out the financial uplift that we have expected to see next year, we firmly believe 
that this is the right course of action for our people, for the long term success of these franchises, and for our 
shareholders. We still have a lot of content in the pipeline for next year for our largest franchises that we can't wait 
to unveil, and we will provide more color on that when we provide our full year outlook in early February.
In conclusion, we see substantial opportunity for shareholder value creation ahead to unlocking the full potential 
of our portfolio which will only be possible because of our people. And we remain focused on ensuring a safe 
working environment that is essential to enable creativity and professional growth for all employees.
Now I'll ask Rob, Mike, and Humam to join Bobby, Daniel, and myself to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matthew Thornton of Truist Securities. 
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Thornton
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Q
Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Maybe one just to come back on some of the workplace issues that the teams 
talked about, can you talk a little bit more about just the progress around rectifying some of these issues? How we 
can think about the milestones and the timeline towards being resolved and being best-in-class? And how you 
plan to kind of communicate that progress along the way? Any more color there would be really appreciated. 
Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert A. Kotick
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks, Matt. This is Bobby. I feel very good about the progress, actually. Right now workplace leadership 
is my focus. Our opportunities for growth as we've talked about have never been better, but we won't be able to 
realize all that growth potential without talent. And to retain and attract the talent we need, we obviously have to 
be recognized as the very best place to work. This means we have to be the most welcoming inclusive 
environment, and we've got to have the best industry leading programs for growth and development. We've got to 
have the best recruiting capabilities for the diverse talent we need to create the very best games, and we have to 
have competitive compensation that is aligned with performance.
If you think about it, over the last 30 years we've shown that we can consistently create the very best games, and 
that has always translated into long-term shareholder returns that are far greater than the S&P 500 and compared 
to most companies. And we believe that superior shareholder returns will continue to be delivered through our 
franchise strategies and the operational excellence that we're recognized for. And we also recognize that to 
achieve the same level of shareholder returns we have historically and to ensure our continued excellence in 
execution, we believe we and all great companies need to deliver workplace excellence.
This means some of the things that we've discussed over the last few weeks but arassment and discriminationfree work environments, recruiting excellence to ensure we have diverse skills, abilities, and talent, and a culture 
that celebrates and rewards commitment to these principles. I couldn't be more passionate and committed to 
being the most performance-focused, welcoming, and inclusive company in entertainment. What you heard me 
discuss earlier is just the beginning of the actions that we intend to take to achieve that objective.
And of course we need accountability. So we'll continue to provide regular progress in updates both quarterly to 
our shareholders as well as annually in our ESG reports, and we'll be monitoring the progress of our business 
units, our franchise teams, and our functional leaders with respect to workplace initiatives. And that status will 
also be reported to our employees quarterly.
Right now and going forward, communicating with our employees and getting feedback has been a crucial part of 
the process. We'll obviously continue to keep our investors informed, but the work that we've done with our 
employees has resulted in very constructive new initiatives, more that we'll continue to announce over the next 
few months. But, the long answer to your question is, I feel good about the progress that we're making. So thanks 
for the question.

Hey, Bobby and team. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two. Can you give us some

long we're going to have to wait? Thanks, guys.

Mike Ybarra
Co-leader-Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Hi. This is Mike Ybarra. Thanks for the question. I'd like to first recognize Jen Oneal who has been an incredible 
partner here at Blizzard. Though we will all miss her greatly, we wish her all the best as we work with her on a 
plan to make an industry-wide impact through the WIGI grant. I personally want to thank her for her leadership.
Since becoming the co-leader of Blizzard three months ago and meeting with teams around the company, I have 
been impressed by their passion for what they are creating and their drive to build a more inclusive culture.
Looking at our upcoming releases across all of our teams here at Blizzard, we have a deep bench of veteran 
development talent, and we have new leadership on both Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV. Both are seasoned Blizzard 
developers with over 30 years' experience at the company between them. The teams have made great progress 
and passed important milestones recently, and we expect these to be fantastic releases. But there's obviously 
been a change in leadership. We looked at what was left in the final phases of production with fresh eyes, and we 
saw that allowing the teams more time would enable both great experiences at launch and also help ensure that 
everything will be in place to engage the communities for many years to come.
This extra time will also help us continue significantly increasing the size of our development teams ahead of the 
launch, again to ensure we are following up the releases with substantial content to continue delighting the 
community. We're not sharing release dates at this time, but I have absolutely confidence in these new leaders 
and their teams to deliver. They care deeply about creating high quality products and allowing everyone on their 
teams to bring their best selves to their projects. Thanks for the question.

know you mentioned the frequency of content and seasonal content whatnot, but would love to hear any color on 
player demographics or cohort analysis to help us get a sense of some of the trends here. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humam Sakhnini
President, King Digital Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Hey, thanks, Clay, for the question. This is Humam. As you can see from the Q3 results, a terrific quarter. And 
Candy achieved its highest in-app revenue quarter since the acquisition. So, let me focus in on that in-app 
performance specifically. There are a number of initiatives that are really been contributing to the success over 
the recent quarters and will carry us into the future. We've increased the optimizations that we put in the game. 
So, we think about this as our player journey, and we've continued to improve that player journey with strong live 
op execution. This benefits across cohorts of players. So, we've delivered compelling content and events more 
frequently across all of our key titles.
So, to give you an example, in Candy, we've increased that engagement by further developing the content slate 
into monthly seasonal events that really draw in new and existing players and provide fun experiences across the 
board. With this quarter, we've complemented that with the launch of the Candy All Stars (sic) [Candy Crush All 
Stars] competition in the US, and we’ ve seen some very strong initial results across reach, engagement, and 
player investment.
We feel we also found a successful formula over the past 12 months to invest and grow live ops, and we are now 
applying that with great results not just in Candy, but across other games, too. So, our second biggest franchise, 
for example, Farm Heroes, over the past few quarters, we've been delivering this content cadence and great 
events and a Farm’ s season pass, and we're seeing the results from that as well. Our in-app growth in Farm 
Heroes has been up 20% year-to-date as a result. With that, we've continued to reinvest into the network and in 
our brands as well.
So, we've seen that our payer numbers have grown double-digit percentage year-on-year versus the year-ago 
quarter. And this is again down to the strong execution that we have in our teams around user acquisition. And 
when you combine with the features and events that are happening in the game, really an amplification of all 
these great trends that we're seeing. So, that's also allowed us to maximize our success in more marketing 
investments and continuing to broaden our player base. So, overall, I feel like we've demonstrated that ability to 
grow both revenue and operating income at the same time. We feel there's still quite a bit of runway ahead of us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel I. Alegre
President & Chief Operating Officer, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
And – Clay, thank you for the question. This is Daniel. First, just a shout-out to Humam and the King team for 
what they've achieved. It really has just been an exceptional performance and journey. And just from an Activision 
Blizzard King perspective, just there are a lot of learnings that we really want to apply across both Activision and 
Blizzard, and it's not just in mobile from the King team's operations. For instance, King's live operation 
capabilities, their deeply analytical approach to creating amazing experiences that truly engage the players, and 
the disciplined data-driven approach to marketing is just very applicable across the rest of the business.
So, we're already making sure that these performance marketing learnings are being applied to our work on Call 
of Duty Mobile and to Diablo Immortal and other mobile initiatives that will be coming in the not-too-distant future 
across the company. So, similar to how we're looking to apply the Call of Duty framework to our other franchises, 
it's another example of how Activision Blizzard is really leveraging the best of each of our businesses to truly 
maximize the potential of our portfolio. Thanks again for the question.

Operator: The next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexia S. Quadrani
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Thank you. My question is really about the Call of Duty. Can you discuss at sort of a high level how Activision will 
integrate Vanguard into Warzone, which announced its content for both Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold 
War? And then can you remind us how the launch of Season 1 of Black Ops in mid-December last year impacted 
the pacing of unit sales relative the prior years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Kostich
President, Activision Publishing, Inc. A
Yeah Alexia, it's Rob. I'll take this question. Thanks. So, to start, we're obviously excited about both the launch of 
Vanguard this week and also Warzone’ s new Pacific map called Caldera, which is releasing in December. The 
new map represents really the first built from the ground up new experience for Warzone since the launch of 
Warzone basically in March of 2020. So, I think the community is going to be really excited to get in and play, that 
and to experience the entire Vanguard universe.
Coming with that of course there are lot of things, some of which were mentioned. I'll just briefly cover them. One 
of which was Warzone shares the same tech as Vanguard and so what does that mean? This is the same tech 
that debuted with Modern Warfare, and so, from a player perspective, you can get a lot more seamless weapon 
and play balance experience across both experiences. And what's become a staple for us now is really a game 
that's fully optimized for cross-play, cross-progression, and cross-gen support, we've seen that the last couple of 
years, and that carries forward. And I think importantly for our community, we're also going to be launching 
RICOCHET, it’ s our anti-cheat system, across Vanguard and Warzone so that our players have the best 
possible experience as we move forward here in the future.
Now, specifically as to the integration, we're going to continue to have the shared progression across Vanguard 
and Warzone just like we had against Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War previously. So, all the great 
weapons, operators, unlocks, and everything that you get on the Vanguard premium experience will also be 
useable in Warzone. So, how the two work together is absolutely intact and better than ever. Battle Pass and 
store content of course will also go back and forth for players to use and have fun with. Now, there is a new 
component for us here, and the new Warzone experience is going to offer some new dedicated playlists that are 
very specific to the Vanguard theme that we think is going to be really fun for the community.
And of course, to honor the players' investment, we'll also have unique playlists that are more of a combined arms 
Batle Royale experience which lets you load outs across Modern Warfare, Black Ops, or Vanguard. So, I think 
that'll be really fun for the community to choose how they want to experience the new map and the new content. 
And also, I think what's become a staple for us as we move forward are players can expect a ton of free postlaunch content and updates from Vanguard and from Warzone to keep them having fun for the long haul. So, both 
games are really just going to get bigger and better as they evolve over time for the community.
Now, going back to your question on the impact of Black Ops last December, so we certainly saw an uptick last 
December. I believe we talked about that in previous earnings calls. And similarly, we expect another uptick this

fourth quarter for our premium sales as we go through that cycle, launch the new map, and see how the 
community engages more broadly both within Warzone and within our premium experience. Thank you, Alexia, 
for the questions.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kunaal Malde
Analyst, Atlantic Equities LLP Q
Hi. Thanks. Just wondering if you can talk about the performance of Diablo II: Resurrected and what it sort of 
informs you about the opportunity for the Diablo franchise overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Ybarra
Co-leader-Blizzard Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Hey. Kunaal, thanks for the question. This is Mike again. The reception of Diablo II: Resurrected has been great. 
As you heard Daniel mention, first week sales were the highest recorded for a remaster from Activision Blizzard 
as a whole. This alongside the continued engagement with Diablo III really is confirmation that our plan for the 
Diablo franchise as a whole is the right one. There's a huge appetite from our player community for more content 
from this dark gothic universe, and it's our job to exceed player expectations.
Diablo II: Resurrected is an early step towards meeting this demand. We have ignited nostalgia in players who 
experienced the original way back in 2000 as well as brought all new players into the fold. Diablo Immortal being 
in its next stage of testing is incredibly exciting, and we'll give players another window into the world of Sanctuary. 
They will be able to take part in an all-new narrative in a persistent free-to-play social experience, all from their 
mobile devices. Immortal provides an even easier entry point for players into a game broader in scope and scale 
than Diablo III.
Then Diablo IV, which will be the darkest expression of the universe yet, is an immersive world players can dive 
into together on PC and console. This is one of the most highly anticipated games in the industry, and we are 
confident that we are building something incredible. These experiences combined create an ecosystem where our 
players of all types can feel at home, and it doesn't stop there. Diablo will always be living and breathing with 
broad content updates over time to continue to delight our players. Seeing the first step of this plan executed with 
the release of Diablo II: Resurrected off to such a strong start is invigorating to the teams across Blizzard, and we 
can't wait to get more into the hands of our players. Thanks for the question.

Great. I have a follow-up on King with respect to IDSA. So, you recorded a very strong quarter despite being the 
first full quarter of the IDSA changes on iOS. So, just curious if there was anything to call out in terms of its impact 
that you saw to Candy Crush or your other mobile titles. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humam Sakhnini
President, King Digital Entertainment, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks, Mario. This is Humam again. Look, we're still early on in the journey with IDSA, but so far we're 
seeing this create opportunities for us on the user acquisition side. And as you would have seen on the 
advertising side, we are continuing to grow quite robustly. So, on the user acquisition side, we have a very large 
and sophisticated user acquisition team, and they've been really hands-on and granular when they run our 
campaigns. And so, when we see these changes and dynamism in the industry because of IDSA, they've created 
market opportunities that we've been able to capitalize on.
And the tailwinds that we are seeing in our payer conversion and spending gives us a lot of flexibility to invest in 
these ROI positive opportunities. So, much of our UA is aimed to win back. So, over 1 billion people we believe 
have downloaded Candy in the past, and so this gives us also a very great brand advantage. Now, on the 
advertising side of the house, we've seen 60% year-on-year growth, which points to our ongoing strength. We 
believe we have a very differentiated product there. It's a premium position with advertisers, and we're still 
learning and building our ad business. So, we continue to focus on ramping up these relationships with demand 
partners with continued positive momentum for both new demand partners and our existing ones. So, overall, 
we're seeing a lot of opportunity in both volume and pricing in the ads business as well. Thanks for the question.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question: I was wondering how you're thinking about the durability of Call of Duty from

Robert Kostich
President, Activision Publishing, Inc. A
Hey, Matt. It's Rob. Look, on your question, I guess I'll start with just saying, in short, I don't think we've ever –
well, I know we've never felt better about the future of the Call of Duty ecosystem as we look forward. To-date, the 
strategies that we've employed, which include of course our expansion into free-to-play with Warzone and Call of 
Duty Mobile, our continued push to deliver incredible new premium experiences, and how the overall ecosystem 
is really connected and works together, is actually just the beginning of what our plans entail long-term.
Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities across game play expansion, platform expansion, and 
geographic expansion to take this ecosystem to an entirely new level for our players around the world. I'd say, put 
another way, we feel there's more opportunity in front of the franchise than at any point in our history, and that's a 
pretty incredible thing to be able to say given the success that we've seen to-date.

Of course, the next phase begins in the coming days and weeks with Vanguard and the new map, Caldera in 
Warzone, but really there's so much more as we look ahead in the future both near and long term. Driving this 
ambition for us of course is our talented development teams and the resources we have there, which we're 
committed to greatly expanding both at our existing studios, but also geographically to find new talent around the 
globe. So, we're expanding in locations like Austin, Guildford, Krakow, Melbourne, Mexico City, and Toronto to 
augment our teams.
And you may already know we recently acquired Digital Legends in Barcelona. They join our mobile development 
roster, which now includes our new internal team, Solid State, as well as the mobile teams at Beenox and 
Shanghai were all coming together on an unannounced project in the Call of Duty universe that is very exciting. 
So, I'd say overall, we feel really good about our plans, our outlook, our team, and our game play innovation as 
we look out over the next few years and beyond. Thank you.

Andrew Uerkwitz
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Hey great. Thank you. Guys, your stock is at I think a five-year low as far as valuation goes. You're sitting on a ton 
of cash. You say you couldn't be more excited about the pipeline. Why not do a stock buyback at this point? Or 
could you talk about capital allocation and kind of M&A at this point? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Armin Zerza
Chief Financial Officer, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Hey, Andrew, this is Armin. Thanks for the question. On your question on capital allocation, as you know, we do 
have a strong track record of being balanced and disciplined in how we allocate capital across all the areas that 
you mentioned, investing in our business, returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends as well as 
strategic M&A. Starting with investing in our own business, you've heard today we continue to have a very, very 
strong pipeline. So, investing in our business and in our development teams remains our key priority. And as 
Daniel mentioned, we continue to look to accelerate organic hiring in this area with aqui-hiring. This was 
announced with Digital Legends purchase last week, but these type of transactions are typically smaller in nature.
Now, with regards to larger M&A, we are always on the lookout for large established franchises that have 
potential for global scale and with strong management teams with a track record of profitability and of course an 
attractive valuation that keeps our return threshold. Now, as you know, we have been very disciplined and patient 
in this area, but the longer term for opportunity for M&A means that we place significant option value on having a 
strong and flexible balance sheet. Now, at the same time, with respect to buybacks, to come to the core of your 
question, we do have a $4 billion authorization. And while you haven't seen us do anything in a long time here, we 
do evaluate our position with respect to buybacks frequently.
Now, obviously the increase in cash generation on the company gives us more and more flexibility over time, but 
bear in mind though that we don't announce when we're buying back stock ahead of time and that sometimes 
there may be restrictions on our ability to comment on buyback. So, in summary, expect us to be – continue to be

Michael Ng
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. You touched upon the increased competition for 
developer talent and the higher voluntary turnover. I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit in more detail 
about Activision Blizzard's efforts to attract and retain talent, whether that's moving more towards a distributed 
workforce or being more aggressive in hiring. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel I. Alegre
President & Chief Operating Officer, Activision Blizzard, Inc. A
Great. Thanks for the question. And this is Daniel, I guess I'll take the last question. This is obviously something 
extraordinarily important, and we're putting a tremendous amount of effort into it. And we've made some very 
substantial progress in this area particularly over the last year. Retaining and attracting our top talent, as Bobby’ s 
mentioned, is critical to us being able to meet the needs of our players, of our communities, and of growing our 
business.
And there's really nothing more important to the company than our talent. And it really starts with making sure that 
our existing teams have the best possible working environment. That's an imperative. And that's also a setting 
that fosters creative excellence and importantly fantastic career opportunities where people are willing to invest 
their time and their careers at our company. And you heard from us today some of the measures that we're taking 
to ensure that, and we will continue to make significant progress. And when it comes to hiring, we're really 
fortunate that many individuals want to work on our franchises for which they have just tremendous affinity. 
They've played it for a very long time and oftentimes since they were little. And we can offer that with some of the 
biggest franchises in the world. We also have the financial scale that enables us to compete for that talent.
But I know that's not enough. And especially with many people's attitudes to where and how they want to work 
changing during the pandemic, we have to keep that in mind. And we're giving our teams the flexibility that they 
need, and we have also been investing in studios, as Rob mentioned, in many locations that are new for us 
including Krakow, Melbourne, Toronto, and Mexico City, where I'm from. We've had a lot of success in hiring in 
recent months in those franchises that were earliest in embracing this geographic expansion and flexibility, 
particularly for Call of Duty and for Candy Crush. And we've already started to pursue that same approach for 
Blizzard and Blizzard's franchises. And Mike, he is completely on board with this as we continue to invest and 
grow our teams in multiple locations. So, thank you for the question.

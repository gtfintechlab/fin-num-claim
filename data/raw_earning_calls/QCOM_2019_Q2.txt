......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc.
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report another 
strong quarter. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.77 per share exceeded the high end of our 
guidance range, driven by higher licensing revenues and stronger QCT margins. As we look forward, the rest of 
the fiscal year will be impacted by a slower market for devices, particularly in China, upstream of the larger 
rollouts of 5G worldwide.
Two weeks ago, we announced the global settlement of our disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers. 
We believe the settlement is a win for both companies and we are pleased with the result and pleased to have it 
behind us. Dave will provide more details on the financial impact of this settlement in his prepared remarks. But at 
a high level, this settlement includes two long-term agreements with Apple, a global patent license agreement and 
a multi-year chipset supply agreement. The settlement also includes a one-time payment from Apple to 
QUALCOMM.
The term of the global patent license agreement is for six years with an option for Apple to extend for an 
additional two years. This represents a significant milestone, as it is QUALCOMM's first patent license agreement

directly with Apple. In addition, we believe our resolution with Apple enhances our position with respect to 
resolving our ongoing licensing issues with Huawei.
We will also be supplying modems to Apple for future devices under the terms of our new multi-year chipset 
supply agreement. In the long term, we will also have the opportunity to provide Apple with other QUALCOMM 
technologies and products to expand our dollar content share in Apple's products, as we have done with our other 
handset OEMs. We are committed to a strong partnership with Apple.
Now that the dispute with Apple is behind us, I thought it'd be helpful to describe how we are thinking about the 
positioning of the company going forward. First, 5G will be a significant opportunity for QUALCOMM, both within 
cellular and in other industries. It is the key technology enabler for the future of the Internet and having a strong 
and differentiated technology position is an important asset for our shareholders.
This past quarter was a tipping point for 5G when in February, at Mobile World Congress, representatives from 
major Android device manufacturers, network operators and infrastructure providers joined QUALCOMM in 
celebrating our collective achievement in bringing 5G to life.
Since that event, I am pleased to report that the rollout of 5G has officially begun. In the last months, we have 
seen carriers and OEMs announce and launch commercial 5G services and devices in North America, South 
Korea, Europe and most recently China, representing the first global rollout of a new wireless standard.
The arrival of 5G in China is particularly exciting as it brings 5G to the largest mobile user base in the world. Todate, the vast majority of the announced 5G devices for China include QUALCOMM's Snapdragon chipsets.
Second, we enter into the 5G era with strength in products, a favorable competitive dynamic and more customer 
diversity and technology breadth than in earlier generations of cellular. This is due to QUALCOMM's continued 
focus on investing in innovation and R&D during a time of much activity and attention on our company.
We've transformed QCT by diversifying our customer base, focusing our investments and streamlining our cost 
structure. Our year-to-date non-Apple QCT operating income doubled compared to a two year-ago period, putting 
us in a strong position to grow revenues and profits as we begin ramping 5G in addition to supplying Apple under 
this new agreement.
As 5G network launches continue to grow, so does our QCT design win pipeline. We now have over 75 5G 
design wins, more than double the number we announced last January, driven by OEM designs with our first and 
second generation 5G modems.
In February, we announced our second generation 5G modem, the Snapdragon X55, our second generation 5G 
RF front-end solutions and the world's first mobile platform with integrated 5G, all of which position us to power 
the second wave of 5G devices launching in late-2019 and early-2020 to drive mainstream adoption of 5G.
Our early investments in 5G now allow us to offer the world's first modem-to-antenna system for commercial 5G 
new radio smartphone devices, spanning millimeter-wave and sub-6 gigahertz bands, including baseband, RF 
transceiver, RF front-end components and millimeter-wave antenna modules. This systems approach is creating 
a benchmark for 5G RF front-end performance. QUALCOMM is heavily engaged as a critical partner to leaders 
across many industries as they see 5G mobility as a foundational technology for their digital transformation.

Third, our cost structure and investment focus are aligned with the opportunities ahead. We will continue to invest 
where we can leverage our core competencies and bring innovative solutions to large markets. In 5G, this 
presents opportunities for growth in our core cellular market in addition to many adjacent industries as they 
leverage 5G to accelerate their digital transformation.
In summary, with our agreements with Apple, the beginning of the 5G ramp, our focus on operational execution 
and capital return, we think we've laid the groundwork for growth in revenue and EPS and stockholder returns 
over the next several years.
As a management team, we are committed to driving stockholder value by taking thoughtful and deliberate 
actions that we believe will ensure the long-term growth of our company as you have seen.
We appreciate the positive reaction from investors and analysts to our recent announcement with Apple, 
especially the feedback from many stockholders over the last two weeks who have recognized and appreciated 
our commitment to sustaining QUALCOMM's long-term differentiation and focus on technology and innovation.
I would now like to turn the call over to Dave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc.
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce strong second quarter results with 
GAAP revenues of $5 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, $0.02 
above the high end of our range.
The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by QTL revenues of $1.12 billion that were positively 
impacted by approximately $100 million of out-of-period catch up offsetting some impacts from overall market 
weakness.
Additionally, we saw improved QCT gross margins and operating expenses which came in lower than expected. 
QCT revenues of $3.7 billion were in line with expectations. MSM shipments of 155 million units were within the 
guidance range, but below the midpoint, reflecting overall weakness in global device shipments.
QCT EBT margin was 14.6% for the quarter, at the high end of our prior guidance range driven by improvements 
in gross margins. Please note results this quarter do not contain any contributions from the settlements of our 
disputes with Apple and its contract manufacturers.
Turning to our global 3G/4G/5G device forecast. We are lowering our estimates for calendar 2019 by another 50 
million units at the midpoint to 1.85 billion units due to continued weakness in China and a lengthening of handset 
replacement cycles, potentially reflecting a pause in advance of 5G rollouts. We now expect global handset units 
to decline slightly year-over-year, offset by continued growth in non-handsets resulting in total overall unit growth 
of approximately 3% at the midpoint.
In regards to our recently announced Apple agreements, we expect to record revenues resulting from the 
settlement of matters prior to the effective date of the agreement of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in our third fiscal 
quarter. This includes a cash payment from Apple and a release of related liabilities. The settlement amount will 
be excluded from our non-GAAP results.

Our guidance for the third fiscal quarter, we estimate GAAP revenues to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $10.2 
billion; and estimate GAAP EPS of $3.57 to $3.77, which includes the revenues related to the settlement with 
Apple and the contract manufacturers. We estimate fiscal third quarter non-GAAP revenues to be in the range of 
$4.7 billion to $5.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.70 to $0.80.
For QTL, we expect revenues to be between $1.225 billion and $1.325 billion including the addition of ongoing 
Apple royalties, offset by a relatively modest impact from previously discussed market weakness and impacts 
from OEM mix. This compares favorably to the second quarter QTL revenues, which after adjusting for 
approximately $100 million of greater than expected catch-up revenues, was about $1.025 billion.
As a reminder, our third quarter guidance includes the last $150 million payment under the interim agreement with 
Huawei. We expect QTL EBT margin to be 65% to 69%, up sequentially, reflecting the inclusion of Apple licensing 
revenues and modestly lower litigation expense.
In QCT, we estimate 150 million to 170 million MSM shipments for the third quarter and EBT margins between 
13% and 15%. QCT is also being negatively impacted by overall market weakness, unfavorable OEM mix shift, 
including share shift towards Huawei and near-term impacts to adjacent businesses from economic weakness in 
China.
With respect to the cost plan, we have completed and achieved substantially all of the target $1 billion savings 
based on our second quarter run rate excluding excess litigation costs.
For our third fiscal quarter, we expect non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to increase 6% to 8%. 
About 6 points of the sequential increase reflects an increase in our employee bonus plan as the result of the 
impacts of our Apple settlements.
Litigation expense savings are expected to be modest in the third quarter given expenses incurred in advance of 
the resolution with Apple and its contract manufacturers as well as continuing costs related to the ongoing 
regulatory actions in the U.S., Korea and EU.
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we expect further litigation cost savings, partially offset by investment in our 
employees. Longer term, we expect litigation cost savings to be somewhat offset by increased investment to 
support Apple product ramp.
Turning to our tax rate. We estimate our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 14% to 15% and 
expect it to be a good proxy for the remainder of the fiscal year.
As an update on our share repurchase activity, as of May 1, we have completed approximately 65% of the ASRs 
at an average price of approximately $61 per share. As a reminder, we expect to complete the ASRs into early 
September. We are estimating 1.23 billion weighted average shares outstanding for the third fiscal quarter and 
approximately 1.2 billion weighted average shares outstanding for the full year fiscal 2019.
Looking longer term, when we announced our settlement with Apple, we indicated the deal would add an 
incremental $2 of EPS from the combination of ongoing Apple licensing revenues and product shipments as we 
fully ramp. The $2 EPS estimate excludes any impacts from the $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenues resulting 
from the settlement and it does not incorporate any impacts from the reduction of excess litigation expense. The 
$2 estimate also does not reflect any contributions from potential resolution with Huawei.

Before I finish my prepared remarks, let me summarize the key drivers of our long-term earnings growth 
opportunities. First, with the global launch of 5G starting in the second half of calendar 2019, we expect to see an 
increase in both device and chipset selling prices and are well-positioned given the strength of our 5G chipset 
roadmap.
Second, with the multi-year agreement with Apple, we expect to see significant revenue and margin expansion for 
both our licensing and chipset businesses, with further additional opportunities to capture broader product content 
over time.
Third, we are seeing increased design win traction for our RF front-end products across all OEMs, driven by the 
upcoming launches of sub-6 and millimeter-wave 5G devices.
Fourth, while some of our adjacent opportunities have seen short-term impacts from economic weakness, we 
remain confident in our ability to scale these opportunities over the next few years.
And lastly, we will continue to focus on increasing gross margins and driving operating expense efficiencies, as 
we realize our growth opportunities outlined above.
Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord

T. Michael Walkley
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Q
Great. Thank you. Congratulations on the Apple settlement. A couple questions built into that. With the settlement 
reached with Apple, can you update us on how negotiations are going with Huawei? And with the Apple 
settlement, does the agreement the way it's structured with Apple trigger any changes to current licensees, or 
open up any other current licensee agreements? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander H. Rogers
Executive Vice Presdent & President, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So, Mike, this is Alex. In terms of the negotiations with Huawei, they're ongoing. We feel that the Apple resolution 
enhances our ability to resolve issues with Huawei. So we think that's a good thing. In terms of the triggers, I can't 
get into the specifics of MFN type provisions. Those are confidential. But we're confident that we'll be able to 
address any inquiries coming in relating to the nature of the Apple resolution and essentially address other
licensees. And I think if you take a look at our Q3 guide and our fiscal year 2021 incremental $2 EPS gives you a 
sense of kind of how we see that all working out.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James E. Faucette
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask as it relates to just handset demand. Clearly, you're making 
adjustments and that has impact on QCT. But from a demand perspective, are you seeing any sequential 
changes or stabilization in that? Just trying to get a sense for where you feel like we're at in terms of potential 
incremental risk to those estimates.
And then dovetailing on Mike's question related to Huawei. Can you walk us through a little bit, maybe on a yearover-year basis, how Huawei's share gains and those kinds of things may be limiting QTL's benefit, particularly 
post the Apple settlement? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, James, this is Cristiano. I'm just going to get the first question and hand over to Alex. I'll start with the 
sequential. No, actually, if you look at our non-Apple MSM business, I think our growth has been consistent with 
sequential growth historically, when you look at our guide for Q3. So I think sequentially, we've basically seen the 
business behave in exactly the same way. What we did see, it was a little bit of a market weakness. I think it was 
in the script, economic weakness, particularly in China.
But the offset of that, we see a pause ahead of a 5G launch. And I want to remind everyone that China just 
launched. They were supposed to launch in September. China Unicom and then followed by Telecom just 
launched weeks ago and I think that has an impact, but if anything, builds our confidence I would think about the 
later part of the year with the 5G transition. With that, Alex, do you want to take the other question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Actually I'll jump in. This is Dave. On the Huawei share, couple of thoughts. One, obviously as they pick up a little 
bit of share right now, we are only being paid in QTL under an interim agreement which is fixed at about $150 
million a quarter. So, we don't see any financial pickup from share shifts that way. And then similarly in QCT, 
some of that share coming from OEMs that we monetize a little bit more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander H. Rogers
Executive Vice Presdent & President, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
I'll just add one more point. This is Alex. And that is, while we have this interim agreement arrangement, I just 
want to remind people what we do have an existing agreement with Huawei that was entered into at the end of 
2014 on the eve of the NDRC resolution. We think that's very good, very fair agreement. And so, that is the 
context in which this ongoing negotiation is occurring.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please proceed 
with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Caso
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Yes, thank you. I guess the question is just helping us to get a little more granularity on what's in the $2 number 
that you mentioned. I guess first thing on that is the timing of that $2 impact. Obviously, as some of the chipset 
designs ramp that happens over time, so does the $2 impact represent the full impact of that or perhaps some 
interim? In addition, does the current QTL guidance fully reflect the full royalty payments paid by Apple now such 
that we should be able to annualize that, and that will get us to the licensing portion of the $2?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, this is Dave again. So, first of all, on that second part of the question, so our Q3 guide reflects the inclusion 
of Apple go-forward royalties. It does also reflect some headwinds related to the market. But it can give you a 
sense of the Apple contribution and where we are on a go-forward basis in QTL.
I would think about the quarter as it's a seasonally one of our lighter quarters for QTL. So if you think about 
annualizing that, I would take that into consideration as you think about the number on an annual basis.
And then, the $2. So the $2 – we've indicated the $2 is reflective of contribution from ongoing licensing now going 
forward as well as chipset contributions once we ramp. We expect that as we ramp to see a more significant 
contribution on the QCT side.
So I think if you kind of look at where we see the contribution from Apple on the QTL side, based on our quarterly 
guidance, you can get a sense of that element of the $2; and then, the rest is coming from QCT as we ramp. And 
I think as Steve said, we would see, there's potential for opportunities to do more with Apple down the road, but 
it's reflective of our views at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please 
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the QTL revenue run rate. So the revenue guide is 
$1.275 billion, obviously includes Apple, also includes $150 million in Huawei. If I take Huawei out, you're sort of 
guiding $1.125 billion. Before you had told us the right run rate was kind of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. So even with 
Apple you're only guiding a little bit above that.
Is this just purely a function of the ongoing market weakness? Because I mean you've been running that core 
business $900 million or lower the last quarter or two. Or is there something else going on? Like, what do you 
think the actual run rate of that core QTL is ex Apple and Huawei versus the $1 billion to $1.1 billion guidance that 
you had given us previously?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yes. The $1 billion to $1.1 billion we had given previously was inclusive of the $150 million with Huawei.

No, no. No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So two quarters ago, we had guided where it did not have it in. And then we adjusted that in the January call to be 
inclusive of the $150 million from Huawei. And in the January call, we guided down the market by 50 million units. 
And in this call, we're also guiding down another 50 million units. So the bulk of what we're seeing – we are 
seeing some continued headwinds in the market for QTL in our Q3 guide which is somewhat offsetting the 
impacts of the addition of Apple.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with 
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Blayne Curtis
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask on just the legal front what's left? You talked about 
reinvesting some of the potential savings and litigation costs. And maybe you can just level set us as to what that 
number was and then just walk through what's left. And if you can speak about the FTC, I would appreciate that 
as well. But kind of just walk us through the rest of the year as to what you have left in legal and so we can get an 
idea of what you're reinvesting? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah. So litigation, said in the prepared remarks, Q3, we're not expecting to see a lot of savings, some modest 
savings in Q3. We had a heavy run rate on litigation in advance of reaching a settlement with Apple ahead of the 
San Diego case. And then, in Q4, we are expecting additional savings as we wind off of the Apple-related 
litigation expense.
A couple of offsets to that, namely the adjustment to our employee bonus accrual which had a big impact. It was, 
as I said, about 6 points of our 6% to 8% increase was related to that adjustment in the employee bonus and we 
have some of that flowing through into Q4 as well. So we're not expecting to see a lot of overall savings with the 
ramp down of litigation and some of that offset in Q3 and Q4, but we expect to see more of those savings flowing 
into fiscal 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald J. Rosenberg
Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
And, Wayne (sic) [Blayne], this is Don Rosenberg. Picking up on Dave's points about litigation, clearly we were 
spending a lot of money and a lot of time in resources on the worldwide litigation with Apple. As you know it's 
grown dramatically. So eliminating all of that now is pretty much the, has been the key to getting us back in a 
normal litigation cadence. We still have, obviously are waiting for the judge to rule on the FTC case, which we 
won't comment on. And we've got the normal amount of various patent cases and others around the world, but a 
couple of class actions that flowed from some of the previous allegations that are waiting to – Apple on the FTC 
and others. But it's a dramatic decrease in the amount of litigation we're going to have to be managing over the 
next several years, I think.

Hey, thanks for taking the question. Steve, I just wanted to check if you can lay out for us the competitive 
landscape in 5G, particularly as it relates to baseband modem, software, Intel tech set like, does that change how 
you think about your position in 5G and the peak either the pricing or the margin opportunity around peer-to-peer

Additionally just a follow-up. I know you guys talked about the one-time payment from Apple. Any color on what 
the uses of that cash are in terms of how you're thinking about capital allocation around that, that will be helpful. 
Thank you.

Hi, it's Steve. Maybe I'll ask Cristiano to take the first part of that and then I'll add my perspective and answer the 
second part.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Samik, we feel very strong about our 5G position in the marketplace. I think, I remind you all that we actually 
accelerated a timeline by one year and we've been the silicon of choice in every single trial in development across 
infrastructure in operator and device. So it's a very strong position consistent to what we saw the company doing 
in 3G and 4G. And we expect that's going to be a significant opportunity to expand ASPs in silicon content for 
QCT. And we just updated a number of designs, we see about 75 designs for 5G right now. And we also have 
that in all those 5G designs I think the absolute majority of it has our RF front-end content. So 5G is a very good 
story for QCT and will be a very material event in fiscal 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, I would just add very briefly that I think it's unfolded in a way that's pretty similar to the way in which we 
thought. It's very important to be at the front end of these transitions. Right now the team, and the front end of this 
transition really meant you had to have a lot of modem expertise across multiple technologies. But also our 
expertise to really handle all the RF bands and the complicated antennas, which is I think we're getting good 
traction on those investments in the past, and we're hoping to see that really flow into the business particularly in 
the next fiscal year.
Now the real race is, how do you bring 5G down in price point through integrated products. You saw the first one 
of our products announced. You'll see more and more of that. Very pleased with the way those products are being 
– demand or at least the roadmap traction that we're getting from those and we'll continue to do that.

In terms of the use of the one-time payment. I think we gave some data here about how our capital return 
program, particularly the ASR has done, which has been good. That's been a strong program for us. We are, I 
think, in a different mode in terms of our ability to look at the landscape here over the next couple years. The thing 
that the – really the Apple settlement and the launch of 5G coming together, we think it puts us in a very stable 
position in terms of our visibility into revenue and kind of the competitive dynamics.
So now the question is, how do we add to the company, what do we need to do in order to really drive some of 
the opportunities that we're getting from 5G. So we're looking at that, but still committed to all of the operational 
excellence, both cost and capital return that we talked about. But we got a lot of opportunity ahead, we think, 
particularly with the stability that this resolution provides us.

Tal Liani
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hi, guys. The $4 billion, $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion for Apple, is all of it a retroactive payment for what they didn't 
pay? Or is some of it going to be related to future, kind of upfront payment for future? And that means how will 
you recognize revenues for this amount? Will it all be recognized as one-time? Or will you recognize some of it 
ratable over the life of the contract?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, the $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion is all for resolution of things prior to the effective date of the agreement. So it's 
all past. We'll recognize it one time as revenue in Q3 in our GAAP results. And then our go-forward guidance on 
QTL includes the forward impact of ongoing royalties from Apple starting in Q3. And I would note, our $2 estimate 
is solely go-forward licensing revenues plus chip contribution.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tal Liani

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ross Seymore
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Hi, guys. Congrats on the settlement with Apple. Just had a question on the revenue premise. I believe you 
guided for it to be up substantially and it was. And I think you said it was in line with your guidance. So two parts 
to the question. Can you give us a little color what drove that up so nicely in the March quarter? And then of equal 
importance, it looks like you're guiding for that to be flat sequentially in the June quarter. So can you talk about 
some of the puts and takes that benefited margin and why those are continuing or not in the June quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Ross. This is Cristiano. Yes. I think when we look at the March quarter, I think of product mix and especially I 
think of some of the premium tier chipsets was in seasonality with our Chinese customers. And as we look at the 
guide for Q3, those are some of the comments we made before. We had overall market weakness in China, but 
we are also seeing in the premium tier a pause as 5G has launched. 5G has launched in China. And it is an 
Android ecosystem phenomena, 5G launching on Android and where I see the MSM 800, which is our 5G 
designs, we see that pause as the 5G phones are coming to market.
Also consistent when some of the other OEMs that report their earnings and they talk about dynamics on the 
premium tier in the market. So, we're seeing that. I think the other comment we made is when you look at 
sequentially, our growth sequentially, when you look at our guide Q2 to Q3 for our non-Apple business when you 
eliminate the legacy Apple units, it's been very consistent and it's in line with the historical data.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Steve, you gave I thought some helpful information in your prepared script 
about some of the non-Apple progress that you made in QCT over the last couple of years. And you've dropped 
us some data in the last few quarters about some adjacencies that have been growing. I wonder if you might step 
back and give us a little color on the investments that you've been making in areas like auto, networking, some of 
the adjacencies that you had talked about growing the company into over the last maybe three or four years ago 
before some of the headwinds with Apple.
And Cristiano, specifically about RF, it looks like a ton of RF attach in the early 5G programs. Any thoughts about 
how sustainable that might be until volume ramps in 2020? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Why don't I start with the general one and, Cristiano, you can dig into the second one. So, if I look at the 
adjacencies, and we've done a couple of things here over the last several years. First of all, we've really tried to 
focus the company on things that we can see that heavily leverage the technology roadmap that we have for 
mobile.
We're doing that upstream of 5G primarily because we think that technology roadmap is the relevant roadmap in 
these adjacent industries. So, a great example of that is cars. So, in the car, the connected car, the opportunity for 
us to sell modems and now computing capability in the head units and then ultimately some of the broader 
computing in the car increases and we've seen that progress well here over the last several years. That's a good 
business. Longer timelines, harder to get into, harder but stickier, I guess, which is good. I think that's going well.
Industrial IoT, which is a business that I think leverages this digital transformation aspect that I mentioned in my 
remarks is going well. Consumer IoT I think has yet to really embrace some of the opportunities that are coming. 
We still think that's going to be an interesting opportunity, but the industrial side is probably a little better for us. 
We are continuing to invest in the go-to-market aspects. We have a pretty strong technology roadmap. It's our 
ability, is how do we mesh into those differentiate shaped markets versus what we see in cellular, but a very 
strong roadmap to go into there.
You mentioned the RF side. We think there's significant opportunity, particularly with the advent or the growth of 
5G and the importance of the RF there, to grow content within the device. And when we see opportunities to do 
that, we're doing that. So, you see that in RF, Cristiano will comment about that.
I also don't want you to miss some of the opportunities like fingerprint that we've been able to invest into. And 
those are interesting opportunities. So, we see 5G as an opportunity to allow us to really leverage some of the 
R&D scale that we have in mobile. And as we see that, we're going to take advantage of it and try to stay focused 
along the same way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So, I was just going to add a few things. First, when you look at, as you mentioned, the adjacent for us non-Apple, 
when you exclude Apple, even with some of the economic weakness we're seeing, we're still growing both Q2 
and Q3. When we look at year-over-year, it's still double-digit growth. Some of those bets, they're small, but the 
trends are very – they are very good.

I think I want to highlight a few that Steve mentioned on industrial. The alignment on our industrial bet with the 5G 
and the fact that 5G is going to go to many other industries beyond mobile. It's going to be a major tailwind to get
a scale on industrial IoT. We see the same thing with the Cellular V2X, and it was going to be added to our 
existing digital cockpit in telematics business.
One data point that we didn't mention, we still haven't bet on computing. And you should expect to see in the 
second half calendar, our 8cx which our first a Snapdragon dedicated for PCs with Microsoft. And that will be the 
first opportunity that we started to see that investment materializing.
Now going back to the front end, I believe that our position in 5G is differentiated. What's happening with 5G, the 
speed of the road map, especially as you think of a number of antennas and carrier aggregation is moving faster 
than we saw with 4G. And the ability to design as a system and claim some of the real estate that you had on 
devices for the front end is giving us an advantage.
We're the only company now that actually has everything from digital to the antenna in-house, and that give us an 
ability to build on our strength of being a system versus just a component provider. And that materialize in the fact 
that every single 5G design right now you'll find our front end and we expect that to continue.

your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Muse
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I'll ask two, if I could. First one, trying to level set QTL 
revenues ex-Apple. So could you help me understand what catch-up payments or input/output were related to 
ASC 606 and other kind of moving parts within that QTL for March and any expectations for June?
And then the second question, your goal I believe was $6.4 billion OpEx without excess litigation for fiscal 2019. 
Obviously, will come in above that because of the litigation. But as you look to fiscal 2020, is that a number that 
we could get to considering that most of the litigation that we've been talking about is behind us now? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yes, so let me start with Q2. So we indicated in the prepared comments there was about $100 million of more 
than expected one-time or out-of-period in the QTL revenues of $1.12 billion. So that relates to I would say both 
ASC 606 adjustments for prior, as well as some one-time adjustments related to some cleanup from prior periods 
on a few programs.
And then, on a go-forward basis, our basis obviously with ASC 606 is forecasting our revenues. There is always 
going to be some chance of true-up as we move forward and move from really actuals that are based on 
somewhat of an estimate to sort of final understanding of how quarters rolled out. So Q3, nothing specific with 
respect to out of period. But we'll have some of that I think every quarter just based on the nature of ASC 606.
Then with respect to the OpEx, so, yeah, the target was to get to $6.4 billion. We do still have excess litigation. 
And as I said before, we expect to rely some of those litigation savings as we move into fiscal 2020, maybe 
somewhat offset by our need to invest a little bit more to support ramp of Apple.

Kevin Edward Cassidy
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Thanks for taking my question. For your chipset ramp with Apple, is there an opportunity to win back the sockets 
on 4G?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, this is Cristiano. Look, we're not providing a lot of details. But I think it's fair to assume that it's going to be a 
new engagement. It takes a little bit of time to develop devices with the chipset. And independent of our 
engagement of Apple, in general, I think all developed economies will have 5G launch in 2019.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Edward Cassidy
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Okay, great. And the RF front-end, you're saying the majority of those designs will include your RF front-end. Can 
you give us an idea of what percentage increase of content that might be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, my comment is about the Android ecosystem. I think we're not detailing any RF front-end engagement with 
Apple right now. What I'll say as we reestablish ourselves as a supplier of Apple, we've reopened the door for 
opportunities beyond the modem.

Timothy Arcuri
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Thanks. Steve, so I wanted to go back to this $2 number. The QTL piece is clear. You were clear about a six-year 
agreement with them. But on the QCT side, obviously, they have a pretty big modem team. So what supply 
agreement if any is there on the QCT side? I think you said multiyear when you announced that $2 number. So 
should we just infer that you'll be the supplier to them for 2020 and 2021 and then beyond that who knows? Or is 
there something else to think about there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah. I'd say this may be a little bit unsatisfying, but I'm not going to go through all the details other than to say on 
the chipset agreement, it's a multiyear agreement. I think both companies are happy with it. It's something that at

least the way we look at it from the QCT side or from the QUALCOMM side, is it provides a lot of stability to our
business. So we think that's a good agreement for us.
And it also, I'll just remind you, there's a lot of tension removed out of the system as a result of these settlements. 
And I really like the opportunity to have the two teams just working together on products in the future, much more 
natural relationships, something that I think both sides can find and maintain a good relationship. But it is a multiyear agreement. And other than that, I really can't talk much about it. You know the terms on a licensing 
agreement, six years plus an option to extend two more years for Apple.

your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srini Pajjuri
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Q
Thank you. Steve, just to follow up on the previous question to the extent you can tell us, what sort of ASP 
increase do you expect in 5G for the thin modems? And then, I'm guessing the $2 number has some market 
share assumptions at Apple. To the extent you can tell us, is it 100% or is it less than that, at least for the first 
generation? And then, Dave, on the QTL EBIT margin, your guidance is for 65% to 69%. When do you expect to 
get back to the previous 80%, 85% ranges? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Okay. On the product assumptions with Apple, I won't give share numbers, but I will comment on ASP. The ASP 
story, at least in the case of as we move to 5G, they tend to be good for us. And the ASPs, as we're moving in 
through the 5G ramp, we've said that they're going to be a good story. And looking at what we're seeing broadly 
across the industry, that seems to be playing forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
And two things will drive the QTL margin going forward. One will be some of the wind down of litigation, excess 
litigation spend. The other important one will be top line expansion, as we now add Apple back in and when we 
resolve Huawei, both of those will be factors driving margin up over time.

David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah. That's the bonus adjustment that I talked about in my script. So resolution of Apple, we adjust our normal 
employee bonus accrual for the addition of the impacts of Apple. Because it's third quarter now, we take a number 
of quarters of catch-up into the quarter. That is not pushed out into the business unit margins. It's held in 
corporate. So that's the bulk of the delta you're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Simpson
Analyst, Arete Research Services LLP Q
And so, just to understand the movement in OpEx that we can expect through into the end of the fiscal year, you 
talked about the litigation. Can you size it at all for us? Can you help us understand, like the magnitude of how 
this sort of plays out over the next few quarters and how you see the underlying OpEx rising, and how we should 
really model the next sort of two or three quarters of absolute OpEx? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Sure. So first of all, in Q3, I think the midpoint of our range is around $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, or something like 
that of OpEx. That includes, when you look at this bonus adjustment, it's about $100 million. So it would put us at 
about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion. That's up slightly from where we were in Q2 on a couple seasonal type things and 
includes some modest savings in litigation. In Q4, we expect further savings in litigation. The one-time elements 
of the bonus catch-up will be out and we think that it puts us probably somewhere flattish on the adjusted Q3. So, 
you think about Q3 without the $100 million at $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Simpson
Analyst, Arete Research Services LLP Q
Okay, that's really helpful. And maybe just finally on op margin targets for QTL, now you've settled with Apple. I 
mean obviously there's still a Huawei settlement at some point, hopefully, fairly soon. But can you give us a sense 
as to how you think QTL op margins are going to trend beyond the June quarter?
And is there a path to get back to the sort of op margins that you were used to before a lot of these overhangs? I 
think you were sort of delivering something around about the 80% op margin level for QTL. Do we ever get back 
to those type of levels? And maybe for QCT, Cristiano, now that you're seeing a little op leverage from winning a 
big 5G deal with Apple, how do we think about op margin target for QCT longer term? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yes. So QTL, I think as I said before, I think a couple of drivers that will improve and that is the reduction of 
litigation savings. So, I said that we'd see more of that flowing into fiscal 2020 from a timing standpoint. And then 
resolution of Huawei and the addition of more on the top line in QTL. So obviously, that timing would be reflective 
of whenever we reach agreement with them as I think the two major drivers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
This is Cristiano. Just on QCT, I think the plan remains unchanged as we gain scale, continue to grow in mobile. 
And we have made a lot of progress growing our non-Apple business and then I think as all of the agreements get

with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Yeah, hi guys. Just wondering if you could give some more color on the RF front-end wins that you mentioned. I 
think you said 75 design wins and majority of them have a front end. Are you doing more of the mid end or low 
end or, and just if you could kind of ballpark what content we are looking at. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Very good. Thanks for your question. On the 5G, if you look at all the 5G bands, the sub-6 bands as well as 
millimeter-wave, that's where you'll find our RF front-end content in all of those 75 design wins for 5G Android. 
The majority of them are flagship smartphones in the premium tier. And our content goes from the envelope 
trackers to the pairments, which is the PA modules, feature-rich content across all bands, switches and antenna 
tuners. And we, as I said before, I think we have been seeing significant differentiations in performance from 5G 
which had allow us to have a whole solution from the digital baseband all the way to the antenna.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Got it. And on the QTL side, if you look at the June quarter, you talked about seasonality. But as you look beyond 
the Apple payments, trying to normalize what would be a normalized QTL run rate that we should be looking at? 
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Interim Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, I think the best way to look at that is, the guide we have now in Q2 includes Apple on a go-forward basis. It 
includes some headwinds associated with market weakness. And it's one of our seasonally lighter quarters for 
QTL. So I think if you sort of take those factors into consideration, it'll help you triangulate to sort of how to think

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As the pace of digital transformation of industries accelerates and
as devices become connected and more intelligent, our broad portfolio of technologies and solutions is creating a significant long-term growth
opportunity for us.
As you can see from our results, the performance in our chipset business led to record fiscal fourth quarter non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and
record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55. Notably, this is our fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year EBT growth in our
chipset business.
We also demonstrated revenue diversification with combined RF front-end, automotive and IoT fiscal '21 revenues exceeding $10 billion, an increase
of 69% year-over-year. Going forward, our chipset business represents the largest growth engine for us as virtually all devices at the edge adopt
mobile technologies. We have the relevant technologies required to continue to lead in mobile and the connected intelligent edge. And as the
edge gains scale in connectivity and adopts own device artificial intelligence, we're well positioned to become a leader in AI processing.
Let me now briefly highlight the strong momentum we continue to see in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial. In consumer, we're
pleased that our XR platforms are powering over 50 commercial devices and gaining scale with the leading VR and AR ecosystems. Our early
investments have established Snapdragon XR as a device platform of choice for connecting physical and digital spaces. And recent market
developments position us as one of the key enablers of the metaverse opportunity.
Additionally, the ongoing conversions of mobile and compute continues to drive demand for Snapdragon-powered premium tablets, 2-in-1s and
laptops. We are pleased with the strong market validation of ARM-based personal computing in the industry transition to a new SoC architecture.
We're more confident than ever in the connected computing opportunity, our upcoming solutions powered by our NUVIA CPUs and our collaboration
with Microsoft.
We're also seeing increased traction in consumer electronics. Our advanced technologies are powering category-leading devices such as the
Peloton Bike+ in tread as well as the ASTRO, Amazon's recently announced household robot.
In edge networking, we are a leader in current and next-generation high-performance Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E access point solutions. And we continue
to see high demand for our products driven by home and enterprise upgrade cycles. We expect this trend to continue as productivity increasingly
requires video collaboration as well as cloud processing and storage.
5G as wireless fiber is now a reality in gaining scale. In the United States, Verizon recently announced 5G home Internet service availability in 57
markets, including more than 2 million households covered on millimeter wave. In addition, T-Mobile is leveraging their 5G network to target 7
million to 8 million home broadband customers over the next 5 years. We're seeing demand increase globally, making 5G as wireless fiber one of
the fastest-growing last-mile broadband technologies.
In industrial, we have expanded our Qualcomm IoT services suite to more than 30 verticals. As an example, in retail, our solutions are powering
digital signage, payment and self-checkout devices from companies like Square and Clover as well as solutions from Honeywell, Panasonic, Zebra
and others to enable new customer experiences, help empower store associates and improve operational efficiencies.
We also continue to lead the way on product innovation with new launches like the Qualcomm Flight RB5, the world's first 5G AI drone platform.
In RF front-end, we expanded our product portfolio with our recently announced ultraBAW RF filter technology that support frequencies from 2.7
gigahertz to 7.2 gigahertz. This is the new industry benchmark for performance in this range. ultraBAW technology also supports Wi-Fi bands,
including 5 gigahertz, the newly adopted 6 gigahertz band for Wi-Fi 6E and future Wi-Fi standards. This creates a new growth vector for RF front-end
as we attach RF solutions to Wi-Fi.
Our RF front-end portfolio, combining ultraSAW and ultraBAW technologies is now best-in-class from 600 megahertz to 7 gigahertz. And with the
addition of millimeter wave, we are the only RF front-end provider with a comprehensive solution for all bands. As cellular expands beyond handsets,
we're focused on extending our modem-to-antenna platform to automotive and IoT.

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
In automotive, we're creating a leading horizontal and open platform with our Snapdragon digital chassis, which includes our telematics, digital
cockpit, Car-to-Cloud service, ADAS and autonomy solutions. Taking the same approach we used to make smartphone the world's largest computing
and developer platform, we're currently working with automakers and Tier 1s to create a joint road map to build multi-tier, multi-generation,
scalable and upgradable platforms for long-term sustainable business.
The strength of our digital chassis strategy is reflected in both our results as well as a strong design pipeline and is creating a platform for innovation
for auto. We are also very excited about Arriver. Upon closing, Snapdragon Ride ADAS solutions will be complemented with Arriver's computer
vision, drive policy and driver assistant assets, enhancing our ability to deliver on an open and competitive ADAS platform for automakers and Tier
1s at scale.
In handsets, we're successfully executing on our strategy. Our premium tier Snapdragon solutions continue to gain traction with OEMs. In fiscal
Q4, devices announced or shipped with our Snapdragon premium tier products increased by 21% year-over-year. Notably, all leading 5G Android
smartphones OEMs by volume continue to power their flagship devices with Snapdragon.
Snapdragon continues to be the preferred choice for premium and high-tier Android smartphones in all regions. As a result, we're benefiting from
the changing OEM landscape in Android SAM expansion.
Lastly, our licensing business achieved fiscal '21 revenues in excess of $6.3 billion. QTL remains the most successful licensing business in the industry,
reflecting the strength of our innovation in cellular technology, the value of our extensive patent portfolio and our execution in securing long-term
agreements with key OEMs as well as over 150 5G agreements to date.
As we have noted throughout the year, we continue to see incredibly strong demand across all our technologies as the current environment is
accelerating the scale of connectivity and processing at the edge. We still expect material improvements to our supply by the end of the calendar
year, and our second sourcing initiatives remain on track.
Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to highlight that we recently announced a goal to achieve net-zero global emissions for Scopes 1,
2 and 3 by 2040. We also look forward to enabling a more sustainable future with 5G through its impact on greenhouse gas emissions reduction,
energy and water use optimization, green jobs creation and more.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to announce record fourth fiscal quarter results with non-GAAP revenues of $9.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.55, reflecting
year-over-year growth of 43% and 76%, respectively. For QCT, this was another record quarter with revenues of $7.7 billion and EBT margin of 32%,
both above the high end of our guidance. QCT EBT of $2.5 billion grew by 143% versus the year ago quarter on revenue growth of 56% and 12
points of EBT margin expansion.
We also delivered record revenues in each of QCT revenue streams: handsets, RF front-end, IoT and automotive. Handset revenues of $4.7 billion
increased 56% year-over-year on strong demand across all major OEMs. RF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 45% year-over-year and included
the benefit of pull-in of demand in advance of certain holiday launches. IoT revenues were up 66% year-over-year to $1.5 billion as digital
transformation continues to drive higher demand across our diversified customer base. Automotive revenues of $270 million grew 44% year-over-year
on the ramp of digital cockpit launches and continued strength in telematics.
QTL revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 72% were in line with guidance. These results reflect slightly lower-than-expected units, offset by
favorable mix.

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Lastly, we delivered GAAP EPS of $2.45, $0.47 above the high end of our guidance, driven by record non-GAAP earnings and approximately $500
million of gains in our QSI investment portfolio.
Now I would like to highlight some key achievements in fiscal '21. We are exceeding all targets we set at our 2019 Analyst Day, which is a year earlier
than forecasted. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 26% in QTL and 64% in QCT, and more than doubled non-GAAP EPS to $8.54.
In QCT, we had greater than 50% year-over-year growth in each of our revenue streams, and EBT margins expanded from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29%
in fiscal '21. Within handsets, our Android revenues for our Snapdragon chipsets were approximately 40% higher than our primary competitor.
With our focus on diversification, RF front-end, automotive and IoT accounted for 38% of total QCT revenues.
Lastly, we returned 74% of our free cash flow to stockholders, including $3 billion in dividends and $3.4 billion in stock repurchases.
Turning to our guidance for handset units in the first fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, we are narrowing the range for 5G handsets to 500 million
to 550 million units. We are now forecasting mid- to high-single-digit growth in global 3G/4G/5G handsets relative to calendar 2020.
For the first fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 to $3.10. In QCT, we expect revenues
of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 32% and EBT dollar
growth of 49%. The sequential revenue growth is driven by handsets due to higher demand, primarily for our Snapdragon chipsets in Android
devices.
Following a record performance in the fourth quarter, we expect nonhandset revenues to remain in line sequentially. Consistent with our previous
guidance, we expect QTL revenues of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion and EBT margins of 74% to 78%. This forecast assumes sequential unit growth in
line with historical trends.
Lastly, we anticipate non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease 2% to 3% sequentially. As a reminder, operating expenses are
typically higher in the second fiscal quarter as it includes calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs.
Looking forward, fiscal '22 will be another exciting year for Qualcomm with year-over-year EPS growth expected to exceed 20%, driven by strength
across all QCT revenue streams. In handsets, we are positioned to benefit from the $10 billion SAM expansion due to the changing OEM landscape.
A portion of this benefit is reflected in our first quarter guidance, and we also expect it to contribute to the rest of fiscal '22.
Before I finish my prepared remarks, I would like to thank our employees for their leadership and contributions in making 2021 successful. Finally,
we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on November 16 where we will provide additional detail about our growth strategy.
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio.
Mauricio Lopez-Hodoyan - QUALCOMM Incorporated - VP of IR
Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Christopher Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
For my first question, perhaps you could help us out with what was different from your expectations heading into this quarter. I know that you
were struggling with supply constraints like everyone else in the industry. Was it that supply came on better than you expected? Was it the demand?
Was it a combination of both?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Yes. Chris, this is Akash. It was really a combination of both. We were -- we had lots of strength in QCT really across all of our revenue streams with
handsets, IoT and RF front-end. Those are the 3 areas that did really well relative to our expectations. And we were able to work through the supply
constraints to address the demand that came up. So it was really a combination of both.
Christopher Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Great. And maybe you could expand on your comments. You spoke about, and I think I have this right, EPS growth is expected to exceed 20% as
you go into next year. Can you give us some details? I'm sure that's something that you're planning on hitting as you're going through the Analyst
Day.
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Yes. Absolutely. I mean it's -- just to clarify, what we guided is non-GAAP EPS growth of greater than 20%. And the key driver for that is really across
all QCT revenue streams. So you're seeing the strength exiting the year, and that's the strength that's kind of playing out both in our first quarter
guidance and also the full year.
The one thing I would highlight is within handsets, we're really in a strong position to benefit from the $10 billion SAM expansion we have previously
discussed from the changing OEM landscape. And a portion of this benefit is reflected in our first quarter guidance, and that's also contemplated
in the greater than 20% EPS growth we are suggesting. Given that we expect handsets to grow faster than nonhandsets in fiscal '22, but really
across the board, we'll have very strong growth rates and really set up to do well in the year and beyond.
Operator
Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst
Congrats on the results. Cristiano, I wanted to dig a little bit with you into the guidance for the December quarter in QCT. I think you guys mentioned
in the script that, that was primarily going to be driven by your Android business and increased supply. So I just wanted to make sure that I got
that right. Obviously, that's a seasonally strong quarter for Cupertino, but I just wanted to dig a little bit more into the dynamics that are driving
the fourth quarter in Android.
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
No, thanks, Matt, for the question. Look, I think what you're starting to see exactly the correlation is going to different directions. You're correct,
it's a seasonally strong quarter for our modem-only shipments. But the sequential revenue growth is primarily driven by Android handsets. And
demand for Snapdragon mobile platforms, both across premium and high tier, and consistent with what we said, we see an incredible opportunity
to grow way faster than the market. And Android is the primary growth driver in our handset business right now.

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst
Very clear. Akash, as my follow-up, 33% QCT op margins in the December quarter. Obviously, there was a settlement with Apple and some things
changed there. But that number, I think, was 13% 2 years ago. So I guess, a pretty remarkable progress. I wonder if you might talk a little bit more,
and maybe this is something for a couple of weeks from now at the Analyst Day, but the puts and takes and drivers of the QCT op margin going
forward. And where are we -- is this a seasonal peak? Or is this a new trend?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Matt, thanks for the question. Yes, we are very pleased by the operating margin performance as well. So maybe I'll point to a couple of drivers, but
really, we are planning to address this in a lot more detail in a couple of weeks. I'll ask you to hold until then.
If you see our gross margin performance in the September quarter that we just reported, very strong gross margins, and we are forecasting in
similar range going into the December quarter.
And then year-over-year, if you look at the full year, so abstract back from the seasonality, we went from 17% in fiscal '20 to 29% in fiscal '21. And
so we feel obviously very comfortable with that number. And in a couple of weeks, we'll talk about how the combination of revenue growth and
gross margin percentage and R&D leverage will take us going forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst
I guess, Cristiano, Akash, both of you are sounding great on Android adoption of your premium chipsets going into the December quarter. I just
wanted to kind of see if I can get some more color about how you're thinking about adoption of millimeter wave with the Android customers. I
know there has been some investor conversation or disappointment around the primary customer not deploying or more widely rolling out
millimeter wave this year. So just wanted to get kind of what you're seeing in the pipeline relative to millimeter wave and how are Android customers
sounding about that? And I have a follow-up.
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Samik, thanks for asking the question. Our position on millimeter wave remains unchanged and will remain unchanged. There are 2, I think, answers
to your question. The first one is continue to track exactly as we expected. We have millimeter wave in the United States. It's now commercially
available in Japan across all carriers, Docomo, SoftBank, KDDI, even the new carrier Rakuten. And we continue to be optimistic about the opportunity
of millimeter wave becoming commercial over time in China.
The first milestone is the millimeter wave for the Winter Olympics early 2022. Japan is moving for millimeter wave, and nothing has changed to
carriers' plans to continue to build this technology. And there are a number of commercial millimeter wave smartphones in Japan that includes
the Galaxy Note the GS21 and Galaxy Fold and Sony. And from our perspective, just knowing what we know of wireless and how the growth of
data is going in the spectrum efficiency, millimeter wave is inevitable. It's just a matter of time. And it's just different markets will deploy at different
speeds, but that's how we get more spectrum, and our position in millimeter wave remains unchanged.

Samik Chatterjee - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst
For my follow-up, if I can ask you on Arriver. We've got some investors asking about how to think about the opportunity with Arriver and how
should we think about OEM customers that are looking for a full stack solution versus OEMs that look for more of like just the hardware piece of
that stack and leveraging Qualcomm from that aspect.
And then if you can provide any updates, I think you've updated us on the purchase price along with SSA partners. But what -- any more details
around the closing as well as the price for Qualcomm stand-alone for the Arriver asset?
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Yes. We're very excited about the Veoneer acquisition and Arriver technology. As we said before, we're the natural owners of good assets. We were
-- believe we're on track to get the ability to get all the approvals and close on this transaction. And more importantly, as we had a business
corporation in place with Veoneer prior to the acquisition, that remains unchanged and allow us to continue to progress towards our ADAS platform.
We're getting incredibly positive feedback from the market from the ability to provide a truly open, horizontal platform for ADAS. And I highly
encourage you to be at our New York Analyst Day. We have a lot more details to provide about what we're doing in ADAS and autonomy.
Operator
Our next question is coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
For my first one, I was curious, just given the current state of the handset market, what kind of handset growth you have embedded in your more
than 20% EPS forecast for 2022? Are you looking for recovery? Or is it all around content? Like how are we thinking about unit growth in the market
to drive that?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Yes. Stacy, for the guidance that we gave, there are no heroic assumptions on market growth. We're assuming similar scale to this year. And within
that, we feel comfortable that we have the opportunities in front of us to grow.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
Got it. So still like mid- to high single digit?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
That's right.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
Got it. For my follow-up, I know you've had supply issues. I know they're resolving by the end of the calendar year. Are you still under-shipping
what you could ship if you had supply? And as that supply eases up, does that have any impact on how we might think about typical seasonality
in the March quarter?

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Yes. Stacy, it's Akash. So we do have constraints really across the board, and you have to figure out how the demand would have played out if there
was supply across the industry. But we feel pretty comfortable that the overall supply picture is playing out exactly as we had planned. We saw
this coming early, and we've been talking about it for the last couple of quarters, and we've put in place plans both for dual-sourcing for certain
parts. We've now announced 3 parts that are dual-sourced that are available. And then also, capacity expansions with our suppliers that were
previously being planned anyways come in towards the end of the year, so that's definitely something that we are very excited about.
On your question on the second quarter, we're obviously not guiding the quarter at this point. But it's a reasonable assumption to think that as we
launch our new Android premium tier chip in the first quarter of the calendar year, that will offset some of the decline you would see in the handset
market naturally within QCT. And then, of course, we also expect nonhandset to grow from first quarter to second quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America.
Tal Liani - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD and Head of Technology Supersector
I have 2 questions, so I'll just ask them together. What is -- what are the trends in China? Meaning the handset market is weakening, and we heard
it throughout the quarter. And on the other hand, there is Huawei share loss and your share gains. So I'm wondering if you can share with us kind
of the trends within China and your outlook for the market.
And the second question is not related, but it's the second question I'm getting from investors, which is you always say that the -- when Apple
starts using their modems, the surface area at Apple is big, and there are other opportunities. Can you elaborate what are the other opportunities?
What are the -- maybe give us scenarios, what are the scenarios that you can still manage the transition of Apple using their own modem?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Yes, Tal, it's Akash. I'll take the first one, and Cristiano will address the second one. So what we saw in the September quarter in the market was
weakness in units in China and emerging markets, but developed markets volume remained very resilient. So that's really the jumping-off point
for the December quarter. We are forecasting normal seasonality on top of what we saw in September.
I'll say that a portion of the weakness was driven by supply imbalances at certain OEMs. And so that did impact the demand to a certain extent,
but that's one of the key factors we saw happening.
Within the market, though, 5G continues to be very strong. So we're seeing 2 trends in China. First is the transition to 5G, kind of there's a variance
month-to-month, but very, very strong, in the high 70s percent has already transitioned to 5G. And so we are raising the guidance, the midpoint
of the guidance for 5G to now 525 million units.
And then within that, we're also seeing higher tier of devices. So Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Honor, all of our customers are moving up tier. And as they
move up tier, that creates an incremental opportunity for us. So it's a pretty positive market trends for us.
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Okay. So I'm just going to answer the second question. So Tal, the second question, we're very focused right now on our contract with Apple, which
is focused on providing modem for their products. We're very happy with the relationship. But anything beyond our contract with them is an upside
to our model. And as I continue to say what I said before, we have a lot of technologies. They have a large number of devices. And if there are

opportunities, we'll be very happy to engage with them in supply. We just don't want to speculate at this point. And we've been very clear that our
assumptions in our model is just focused on our contract. Everything else is upside.
Operator
Our next question is coming from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Clark Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD
Congrats on the strong results and guide. Akash or Cristiano, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the pairing of the handset and the RF side of
things. I know you said that there was a little bit of a pull-in into your fiscal fourth quarter on the RF side of things. But with the Android market
share gains that you're talking about heading into the December quarter, why is the RF side not coming along for that ride? And is that pairing
something that it's just a transition period, and as we look further out, those are going to be more linked together?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Ross, it's Akash. It's exactly the right question. The -- we expect the 2 to move together in concert. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and
that's why we highlighted it, we did see some pull-in from December quarter to September quarter within RF front-end. And it was really where
supply was available, our customers chose to take it sooner than receiving the chipset. And if you normalize for it, the 2 would have moved together.
So we definitely see the growth in the Android opportunity as a tremendous growth vector for us with the RF front-end as well.
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
No, just to be crystal clear, all of this growth opportunity that we're seeing in Android, especially the premium and high, is coming with RF. I want
to make that statement clear.
Ross Clark Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD
Perfect, Cristiano. I guess, as my follow-up, if I talk about QCT ex handsets and ex RF front-ends, it sounds like, Akash, you said those would be
relatively flat in December, but then you thought it would actually grow again in March. What's going on in those markets? And then, I guess, the
higher-level question is, given the supply constraints, there's a big debate going on in broad-based semis between investors worried about increased
selectivity from customers, change in behaviors. Are you seeing some digestion period here? Why is it slowing? And then why is it reaccelerating?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Yes. So as you saw, we had tremendously strong results, both in auto and IoT and record results in both in the fourth fiscal quarter. You're right,
going into the first quarter, we are forecasting in line sequentially. And one of the key factors there is still we are supply-constrained, and we are
making certain decisions given the strong handset market in that quarter to allocate supply a little differently based on profitability. But really,
when you think about the draw demand from the customer continues to be very strong, and so we're confident that when you look at second
fiscal quarter or look at fiscal '21 going to fiscal '22, both those businesses will grow in a very strong fashion.

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Joseph Lawrence Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director
I wonder if you could just talk about the overall supply chain in smartphone. And are you seeing bottlenecks at some of your customers where
they're unable to procure parts that aren't from Qualcomm that might lead to inventory buildup of Qualcomm parts? And it seems like overall, the
handset sell-through numbers are a little weaker because of those constraints, but it doesn't seem like the supply chain has changed at all. Can
you just describe that dynamic?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Sure, Joe. So we're definitely seeing some mismatch of parts in the short term at some of our customers, but you should think of those as really
timing issues. The other thing to keep in mind is, as Cristiano outlined earlier in the call, that we are focusing really on the premium and high-tier
units. And so when our customers have supply mismatch, they actually end up supplying the premium and high-tier devices. So our chips and our
devices are still being used, and it's not something that's a big factor for us in the short term.

Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.
Roderick B. Hall - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD
I wanted to come back to this idea of supply versus demand in the Q1 quarter. I had heard earlier, I guess, someone mentioned that they were
assuming that, that supply would be meeting demand. But it seems to -- well, I just want to check that with you. Is that a good assumption? Or do
you think that we see supply continuing to rise to meet demand on into the fiscal Q2? And then I have a follow-up.
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Rod, this is Cristiano. Look, if I remember, we had said, if I believe, 2 earnings calls ago, that we had put -- we act early, we put a lot of things in
place, multi-sourcing capacity expansions. And we said that we expect to see material improvement in our supply towards the end of the calendar
year. That's reflected in the Q1 guide, our ability to have supply.
We continue to have pockets of areas that we would ship more if we had more, but we see a lot of improvements. We see at least 3 announced
products of multi-sourcing being shipped. And we've been executing on that increased supply. And different companies are going to have different
outlooks. We look at the first half of 2022. We still have some shortage. But as we get to the second part of the year, I think, in general, supply and
demand are going to be aligned.
Roderick B. Hall - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD
Yes. Just, I guess, my question was just aimed at the idea that this seems like it could continue to be a little bit of a tailwind for you as you move
into the beginning of next year, and it's not just magically resolved here at the end of this year.
My follow-up is regarding the Android opportunity. I wonder if you guys could comment on content there versus the other big high-end handset
maker you supply. We calculate a substantial increase in concept, but I'm just curious, do you agree with that? If you sell a high-end Android phone
in January, is that phone going to have materially more content for you than another type of phone might?

NOVEMBER 03, 2021 / 8:45PM, QCOM.OQ - Q4 2021 Qualcomm Inc Earnings Call
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Absolutely. Look, we are very pleased with the strength of our Snapdragon 800 series. Our Snapdragon 800 series became synonymous with
premium Android flagship smartphones. There's a lot more silicon content besides the RF front-end that's attached to the modem. There's GPU.
There's CPU. There's all the multimedia, and it's a lot more richer platform than just selling a modem in its multiple times in terms of revenue and
earnings contribution. And when we look of the SAM available to us, when we look at the consolidation of Snapdragon 800 being the chipset for
every flagship, that's no surprise that we actually grow faster in the Android segment.
Operator
Our next question is coming from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
First of all, congratulations on tremendous execution and diversification. I had a question. Cristiano, you talked a lot about Android and how positive
you are on that. I know you were supposed to get additional supply in the December quarter. You seem to be benefiting from units. Are you
benefiting from units primarily? Or are you also going back and taking share that you were expecting to take from your competitors?
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Look, there's plenty of opportunity with the changing landscape for growth between us and our competitors. I think what's important to highlight
is that Qualcomm has been concentrated into premium and high. There's very high demand for premium and high Snapdragon mobile platforms,
both the 700 and 800. And it is a share gain of Snapdragon in Android premium. And we're very happy with the opportunity to capture actually
the higher value share of the market.
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
And then maybe, Harsh, to add to that, I'll just draw your attention to product announcements that we had a couple of weeks ago where we
announced a whole new set of 5G products across tiers.
Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Great. And for my follow-up, I wanted to follow up on a question that was asked about the March quarter. You talked about some benefit coming
from your premium chips that you'll be launching in the March time frame, which is seasonally weak. Now Apple, for one, talked about leaving I
think it was $6 billion-plus worth of revenues behind on the table. Do you think you might get a benefit from all the handset OEMs that are leaving
revenue behind on the table, along with your premium? Or do you think it's just again your own chipsets that are getting benefit from launch of
new chipsets?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
Well, what I said about the March quarter was really you have a seasonal decline in the handset market. But given the launch of our new chipset
and really all the other chipset launches we have done over the last month, we feel like we will be in a very strong position to expand our units
within the Android market.
And then the second thing I said is nonhandset growth. We expect nonhandsets, all 3 to grow within the quarter as well.

Our final question is coming from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Michael Arcuri - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment
I had 2 questions. The first, Akash, was on the RF business. I think you said at the Analyst Day that you were targeting more than 20% share of an
$18 billion TAM next year. But you're now annualizing to almost $5 billion. So either the market is a lot bigger or your share is a lot higher. So can
you just comment on that?
And then secondly, I had a question on the contract with the big customer. Can you just level set us? Cristiano, you just alluded to it. So can you
level set us? I think it goes through 2024. But can you just help us on the timing of that?
Akash Palkhiwala - QUALCOMM Incorporated - CFO
So Tim, on the -- on your first question on the math, $3.6 billion is right, and we reported results at $4.1 billion, I think. So we've definitely exceeded
the target we've set. And as Cristiano said earlier in the conversation, we are very confident that we have several more vectors of growth left in the
RF business, not just within handsets but also as 5G expands into telematics and IoT and then also within Wi-Fi. So yes, there's some ways to go,
and we'll definitely plan to address that at Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Tim, it's Cristiano. The only thing we can disclose is what we disclosed before. It is a long-term agreement, and it's a multiyear agreement. We --
unfortunately, we cannot say anything more than that.
Operator
Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Amon, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?
Cristiano Amon;President and CEO
Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We are at the intersection of key trends that are accelerating edge connectivity, efficient processing
and own device artificial intelligence. This is driving demand for industry-leading road map of relevant technologies, creating a significant opportunity
for growth and continued diversification. In addition to driving the mobile industry to 5G, we will power the connected intelligent edge.
I look forward to outlining our strategy and vision for the future at Investor Day on November 16 and sharing our next-generation Snapdragon
platforms at our Annual Tech Summit in December.
I also want to take a moment to thank our employees for an incredible fiscal year. They are truly the best of Qualcomm, and there is no better time
to be part of this great company.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Supplemental Financial Information
For the Period Ended September 30, 2021
(Unaudited)
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements within this document include the accounts of Datadog, Inc. 
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Datadog" or the "Company"), and have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
The Company also discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures within this document: non-GAAP gross profit, 
non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (sales and marketing, research and development, general and 
administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), nonGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and free cash flow. Datadog 
uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across 
accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to 
evaluate Datadog’s financial performance. Datadog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP 
measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. Datadog’s non-GAAP financial measures 
may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other 
companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and 
unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial 
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Datadog’s reported financial results.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information 
prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly 
comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.
Datadog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (sales and marketing, 
research and development, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin 
and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) stock-based 
compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) non-cash benefit related to tax adjustment; (4) 
employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions; and (5) amortization of issuance costs.
Datadog defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures and minus 
capitalized software development costs. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical nonGAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing Datadog’s 
operating performance due to the following factors:
Stock-based compensation. Datadog utilizes stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally 
aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address 
operational performance for any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that 
are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.
Amortization of acquired intangibles. Datadog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from preacquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment 
regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during 
any particular period.
Non-cash benefit related to tax adjustment. Datadog recorded a contingent payroll tax liability in conjunction with a 
common stock repurchase transaction in 2016. In 2020, the period of limitations for assessing the contingent Federal 
payroll tax liability expired and the Company was legally released from being the primary obligor, and recognized a benefit 
in the consolidated statement of operations. Datadog does not believe this is reflective of on-going results and therefore 
adjusted for this benefit.
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity 
incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period 
independent of the financial and operating performance of Datadog’s business.
Amortization of issuance costs. In May 2020, Datadog issued $747.5M of convertible senior notes due 2025, which bear 
interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%. Debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt 
instrument, are amortized as interest expense over the term. The expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs is a 
non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense will provide for a more useful comparison of our 
operational performance in different periods.
Additionally, Datadog’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to 
investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital 
expenditures and the capitalization of software development costs due to the fact that these expenditures are considered 
to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.

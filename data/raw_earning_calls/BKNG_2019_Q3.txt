Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO,
David Goulden.
We executed well in our busiest quarter of the year, as we booked 223 million or almost 0.25 billion room nights,
which is up 11% year over year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We are pleased that room
night growth has been reasonably consistent this year. We produced over $5 billion in revenue and approximately
$2.5 billion in EBITDA, which are year-over-year increases of approximately 7% and 8% respectively on a
constant-currency basis.
While we believe these financial results show that we have meaningful size and scale, we note that, against a
very large global travel market opportunity, we are still a small share of the marketplace, which means we have
substantial opportunity in front of us.
I am pleased that our performance this quarter delivered better than expected room night growth, driven by solid
growth in our direct channel, though I note that we continue to witness slower growth in our paid channels. And
while we look to find ways to drive growth through the paid channels, we will remain disciplined and will invest
only if we like the quality of traffic and the associated return on investment.

We remain firmly in execution mode as we work to deliver against our goal of extending our lead in core
accommodations market through key initiatives in customer acquisition, merchandising, our payments platform,
and improving the selection of properties on our websites. We expect these initiatives to improve customer
conversion and drive incremental growth from our existing demand channels.
We continue to execute against our long-term strategy of building the connected trip, with Booking.com recently
launching a flight offering in certain European countries. The launch is still in its very early days, and we will
continue to make product enhancements and improve the customer experience to create what we believe will be
a better offering over time.
We remain excited as our long-term vision of the connected trip is being translated into new Booking.com
services. We believe the connected trip has tremendous potential to create a more robust travel ecosystem that
will result in greater loyalty and engagement for Booking.com's very large active customer base, and it is an
opportunity for our large supplier base to merchandise their offerings.
In conjunction with Priceline.com, Agoda has also launched a flight product that is initially focused on select
countries in the APAC markets, which we believe will complement its existing accommodations offering. I am
proud of our inter-brand cooperation development of this product, which demonstrates how we are able to
leverage our deep travel expertise across our company to build new services. We look forward to introducing
other areas of collaboration across the brands in the future.
We are also excited to announce our partnership with Grab is now showing tangible benefits to our customers.
One of the goals of the partnership is to give Booking.com app users access to the largest fleet of drivers across
eight countries in Southeast Asia, providing our customers traveling in these countries a frictionless experience,
removing language and currency barriers. Right now, Booking.com app users can access Grab services in
Singapore, and we will be expanding this service to Indonesia and Thailand by the end of the year, and to the
remaining markets by early 2020. Another point to note about the partnership is Grab previously introduced a
connection to hotel bookings through its own Grab app using both Agoda and Booking.com.
In our alternative accommodations business, Booking.com continues to build richer content for both its customers
and supply partners. Booking.com recently announced a series of new tools and product enhancements
specifically designed to help professional short-term rental partners more effectively market and simplify the dayto-day management of their properties on Booking.com's platform.
In terms of our listings count, Booking.com's total alternative accommodation listings now stand at over 6.2 million
as of September 30. A key goal continues to be improving both the quality and variety of our listings in this area.
We're encouraged with the progress in the alternative accommodations business and continue to witness growth
outpacing our overall business while maintaining solid profitability.
In regards to the overall global travel market, we believe it is generally healthy, but see some mixed results in
geographies throughout the world. Europe remains stable but is still impacted by somewhat sluggish GDP growth,
which is consistent with what we have seen throughout most of the year. Southeast Asia continues to grow nicely.
However, markets like China and particularly Hong Kong are placing pressure on our overall growth rate due to
certain macro events.
International travel into the United States has been negatively impacted by a strong dollar. Like this year has
shown, though, our global scale has helped us navigate a tricky macro environment, and we remain confident that
we will continue to do so in the future.

In conclusion, I am very pleased with our performance in the third quarter, and we remain confident that the
efforts we are making now will support the long-term growth prospects of the company. I want to thank our over
26,000 employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy third quarter, providing unparalleled service
to both our customers and supplier partners around the world.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden, for the detailed financial review.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the third quarter and then discuss
our guidance for the fourth quarter. All growth rates are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless
otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.
Now, for our results for the quarter, our booked room night growth of 11% for the quarter exceeded the high end
of our guidance range. Our room night growth in Europe continued to exceed our expectations this quarter
despite a macro environment that remains cautious. Room night growth rates for the rest of the world also
exceeded our expectations and grew approximately in line with Europe in Q3.
Average daily rates for accommodations, or ADRs, were down about 3% year over year in Q3 on a constantcurrency basis, which was a larger decline than our guidance of down about 2.5%. The year-on-year ADR decline
was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets such as the US, Japan, and Hong Kong, as well
as an increased mix to faster-growing lower ADR markets.
The increasing pressure on ADRs we're seeing in the second half of the year is influenced by lapping about a 1%
growth in ADRs in the second half of last year and by a number of macroeconomic driven factors, including less
travel in key international corridors due to trade and political issues as well as the strength of the US dollar.
Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced Q3 growth rates in US dollars by approximately 3 percentage points
versus last year. We estimate the changes in FX rates impacted gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA, and EPS
growth in Q3 by similar amounts. Q3 gross bookings grew by 4% expressed in US dollars and grew by about 7%
on a constant-currency basis, coming in above the high end of our guidance range.
Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $5 billion and grew by 4% in US dollars and about 7% on a
constant-currency basis. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of KAYAK and OpenTable,
grew by 12% in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $2.5 billion, which exceeded the high end of our guidance
range, and was up 5% year over year on a reported basis and about 8% on a constant-currency basis.
Performance marketing expense declined 2% year over year, which helped drive leverage of about 150 basis
points in the quarter. This leverage was driven by an increased mix in room nights from the direct channel, which
continues to grow faster than our paid channels. While we'll keep working to grow our direct channel over time,
we continue to see performance marketing channels as an efficient way to acquire customers and will maintain
our approach to spend rationally in these channels.
We spent $124 million on brand marketing in the quarter, which represented a decline of 22% versus Q3 last
year, contributing about 80 basis points of leverage. As we mentioned on our Q2 earnings call in August, we are
refining and focusing our brand spend in the second half of this year. Sales and other expense grew 13% versus

Q3 of last year and contributed about 50 basis points of deleverage, mainly due – primarily due to the growth of
our payment platform at Booking.com.
Sales and other grew slower than merchant gross bookings at 36% in the quarter due to lower growth in certain
payment-related expenses. Personnel expense came in slightly lower than our forecast and contributed a small
amount of deleverage in the quarter.
Finally, G&A expenses increased 41% year over year on a non-GAAP basis. Note that non-GAAP G&A expenses
in Q3 last year excluded a $23 million travel transaction tax charge, which negatively impacted GAAP results in
the prior year. Non-GAAP G&A expenses contributed about 120 basis points of deleverage in the quarter, driven
by a $29 million year-to-date impact from the French Digital Services Tax as well as an additional $10 million
related to travel transaction taxes from prior periods.
Our non-GAAP EPS was $45.36, up 20% versus the prior year. Adjusted for currency, non-GAAP EPS grew
about 24% in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.8% in Q3, which is lower
than the prior year due to a provision of the Tax Act which was clarified in Q4 of last year. Our 10% lower share
count in Q3 benefited EPS in the quarter.
On a GAAP basis, operating income increased by 5% and GAAP operating margin increased by 70 basis points
compared to Q3 last year. Q3 GAAP net income amounted to $1.95 billion or $45.54 per share, up 23% from Q3
2018. Our Q3 GAAP net income includes $49 million of pre-tax unrealized losses on our equity investments in
Ctrip and Meituan and $72 million of FX re-measurement gains on our euro bonds. We excluded these unrealized
losses and re-measurement gains from our non-GAAP results. We have a GAAP tax rate of 17.5% for the
quarter, which decreased from 21.1% in the prior year due to beneficial adjustments made in Q3 2019 related to
the Tax Act that were excluded from our non-GAAP results and from the factors I mentioned that impacted nonGAAP tax rates.
In Q3, we generated $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which decreased 6% compared to Q3 last year. Our free
cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, which decreased by 4% compared to the prior year mainly due to
seasonal effects from our higher mix of merchant revenues and the impact this has in the third quarter due to a
high concentration of check-ins. During the course of the year, we expect the growth of our merchant business
will be a modest positive driver of cash flow.
We purchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q3, bringing the amount remaining under our $15 billion repurchase
authorization to about $12.9 billion at the end of the quarter. We continue to expect to complete this authorization
in the next two to three years, assuming stable business and market conditions. We ended the quarter with $11.8
billion in cash and investments and $8.6 billion of outstanding debt.
Before turning to our guidance, we note that the returns from our growth investments for the year are tracking in
line with what we said last quarter and we still expect these investments to impact EBITDA growth for the full year
by a few percentage points.
Let's now turn our attention to Q4 guidance. Foreign exchange rates are expected to negatively impact year-overyear growth rates for gross bookings, revenue, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS by approximately 1.5 percentage
points. We use a dollar-to-euro exchange rate of $1.11 when setting our Q4 guidance. Our Q4 outlook does not
anticipate any change in the macro environments.

Based on where we are in the quarter and looking at all other factors, we are forecasting booked room nights to
grow by 6% to 8% in Q4. We forecast gross bookings to grow 2% to 4% on a constant-currency basis and about
150 basis points less in US dollars. Our Q4 forecast assumes constant currency ADRs for the company will be
down about 4%, driven by the same factors that impacted Q3 ADRs. A number of these factors are occurring in
Asia, and Asia is a seasonally larger quarter in Q3.
We forecast Q4 revenue to be up 1% to 3% on a constant-currency basis and by about 150 basis points less in
US dollars. Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $1.21 billion and $1.235 billion, which is
approximately flat year-on-year on a constant-currency basis. We're forecasting continued leverage from the
performance marketing expense line in Q4, reflecting low volumes in paid channels and our continued focus on
acquiring high-quality traffic. We expect to see continued leverage of brand spend in Q4. Although we've reduced
our brand spending in the second half of the year, we still expect to grow our brand spend for the full year.
We expect growth in personnel expenses to reduce EBITDA growth by several percentage points in the quarter
due to an expected lower year-end reversal of bonus accruals than we experienced last Q4. Sales and other
expense is expected to grow slower than merchant bookings growth but faster than overall revenue growth.
We're forecasting Q4 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $21.50 to $22 even. Normalizing for constant currency,
we estimate Q4 non-GAAP EPS to decrease year over year by approximately 1% to 3%. This range for Q4
implies a full year constant currency non-GAAP EPS growth rate of about 13%, which is in line with our full year
expectation for low-double digit growth.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast for Q4 includes an estimated income tax rate of approximately 19%, which is
significantly higher than Q4 last year due to a one-time adjustment of approximately $72 million in Q4 2018
related to a provision of the Tax Act that was clarified by regulatory guidance issued in Q4 of 2018. If we exclude
the one-time benefit from Q4 last year, our EPS growth in the quarter would be about 7% higher.
We expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%, compared with 18.3% last year. Our Q4
non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of approximately 42.2 million shares, which is 9%
below Q4 of last year. We forecast GAAP EPS between $20.40 and $20.90 for Q4. Our GAAP EPS guidance for
Q4 assumes a tax rate of approximately 19%. We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth
quarter EBITDA and net income from any further fluctuations in currencies versus the dollar between now and the
end of the quarter, but the hedges do not protect our gross bookings revenue or operating profit from the impact
of foreign currency fluctuations.
We'll now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital
Markets. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark S. F. Mahaney
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Great. Thanks. Two questions, please. Could you talk about whether you're seeing pressures in SEO channels,
whether that's become less viable for you as a source of traffic? And then, Glenn, you talked about paid marketing
channels and trying to diversify amongst them. Could you talk about how you do that? I know this is something
that the company has looked to do for many years. Just how many options are there in order to do that? Thanks a
lot.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Hi, Mark. Well, regarding SEO, we saw some headwinds in the SEO channel that did create some modest
pressure, but it's a small channel for us. Your second question, I wasn't quite following. I don't recall saying
something. So, could you say that again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark S. F. Mahaney
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
I think, early on, you talked about paid leads were coming in a little more slowly than maybe you'd wanted or less
ideal. I think this is something that, for a while, you've been looking for faster channels of paid – high-quality paid
leads. Could you just talk about whether your ability to find those, how do you find faster growth paid leads?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah. Okay, I see where you're coming from. Actually, what we said – now, I figured out what you're saying. We
talked about this for some time that there's been a deceleration of the paid channels. That's been going on for a
long time. Now, we'd like to, obviously, find – we'd like to find more customers from those channels. My point
being, more importantly, that no matter what we're doing, we're going to try and maintain our discipline and only
do it when we see the right ROIs.
There's obviously lots of things that one always work to improve their paid channel, particularly in terms of trying
to increase conversion is the primary thing you can do, and there are also things that looking out in different ways
where we want to shift the money among the different paid channels. These are dynamic markets, as you know,
and what we do will influence what other people do, so it's always a bit of a strategy game going on. But you've
seen our results so far and we're pleased with where we are right now with the paid channels.

Deepak Mathivanan
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, first, what is driving the outperformance in the Europe room night
growth versus your expectations? The macro data points, at least if you look at the industry, third-party sources
appear to be sluggish, and also the commentary from suppliers kind of seem to be the same. Is there a countercyclicality aspect that's benefiting your room night growth? Or would you just attribute it to better execution during
the quarter?
And then the second question, it sounds like the partnership with Grab is off to a good start and is doing really
well. How are you planning to replicate similar strategies in some of the developed markets? Are there more
partnership-based opportunities that you will look at there? Thank you very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Sure. So I don't think we're in the area of counter-cyclicality yet. We mentioned at the beginning that we see the
travel industry in general around the world, I use the word generally healthy. So we're not in an area of recession
that would then stimulate some type of counter-cyclicality. So I think your other point of good execution, I'd like to
ascribe a lot of that just to good execution and give a shout-out to our 26,000 employees who are executing very,
very well.
In regards to the Grab partnership, I agree. I'm pleased with what we're doing there. I like what's happening there.
It's obviously very small still, but it's growing and going the right way. And as you know, at about the same time,
we made a deal with Didi, and I mentioned we're going to bring that one out similarly in the sense of being able to
provide a seamless frictionless ground transportation solution for our customers in China and other places where
Didi operates over time. And also the other way, the same with Grab is being able to expose our offerings of hotel
accommodations, home accommodations, all the other things that we're going to offer to the very, very large
customer base that Didi has. And of course, what we'll want to do is go out and replicate that in other parts of the
world with other players, and that's what our affiliate or strategic partnership teams are going out and doing. And
I'm pleased with the progress they're making in that area.

We've talked in the past about the importance to grow our business, having a balance between the amount of
money that we're going to invest to help grow out the future, at the same time, maintaining discipline to provide an
appropriate bottom line return for our shareholders. We're just going to continue to do that. That's the way we do
it, and we've talked many times about selling things that we want to build.
We talked a lot about the connected trip and how we see, in the long run, that's the winner for us, the
differentiator, the thing that will make customers come back because they will see a better experience, improve
the loyalty, lower the amount of money that we have to spend on the advertising spend. These are all things that
we are continuing to work on, and we're going to continue to maintain that balance.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lloyd Walmsley
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Great, thanks, two if I can. First, Glenn, you all have made a couple investments in ride share companies over in
Asia. You've got a good history of leveraging M&A. Any interest in making more investments in the ride share
space? There are some public assets on sale. Would it make sense to use some of your capital to do more in the
ride share space?
And then secondly, on the payment side, I think you all have said it's shifted from a drag to neutral and then
eventually will be a tailwind to EBITDA next year. Can you talk about how that will flow through the P&L? Is that
just basically higher effective revenue as you start to charge for payments more broadly offsetting the cost? And
then what kind of profit center do you see payments becoming as the merchant business scales over the next few
years and you get your rhythm on the payment side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
In regards to the first question, I think we're all familiar that we don't discuss potential M&A transactions publicly,
so I'll have to pass on that one. And I'm going to pass it over to David in turn to talking about how the funds flows
work and why the numbers will be what they'll be.

David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Lloyd, on the payments side, as you know, there are many moving parts. There are multiple different aspects of
revenue in the payment stream and there are multiple aspects of cost. And essentially, as we've discussed, we've
been using this both to help with the business and as a marketing tool, but also building all the mechanics in to be
able to optimize both sides of that equation, revenue and cost, as the payment platform builds.
So next year, we do expect payments compared to this year to be a contributor to EBITDA growth. And it will
come from both sides, both higher revenue recovery and also through better cost efficiency as you roll the
platform out, as we generate more scale, as we continue to refine the underlying structure of the product. As we
said, long term we certainly view that it can be not only a contributor to EBITDA growth, but also a profit center,
but we don't want to quantify that right now. And as we go into next year, we'll probably give you a little bit more
color as to how the payments business has progressed as a percentage of our mix, but it's continued to increase
nicely from the approximately 10% of Booking.com we talked about in 2018.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Naved Khan
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Q
Thanks a lot, just a couple. So I think, Glenn, in passing, you'd mentioned that maybe the Hong Kong unrest and
maybe some travel restrictions in parts of Asia were a drag on the growth. I would think that having a global
business like yours, people basically switch destinations if they want to travel. So on the whole, are you seeing
that as still a drag? How did that play out?
And then on the connected experience side, I guess you're testing the air bookings in Europe with one or two
partners. How do these partners differ from KAYAK in terms of how they go to market with you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So the first one, you're absolutely correct in terms of a global company like ours, we do get some benefit. When
one particular area becomes a place that people don't want to travel to, there will be a certain portion that will shift
to another place and we will get that business. That being said, another percentage of that business will
unfortunately not travel. They had a specific reason to travel to that region, or they just decided that they just
didn't want to travel. That's what they wanted to do and now they're not going to do it.
So there is a drag even though we are global, and I'll point out that some of the areas which we've mentioned in
the last Q are still going on. China outbound to the US is still down from where it was a couple years ago. That is
a drag. We had good business there. Certainly, we've all seen on TV what's going on in Hong Kong, and that also
is a drag on the economy. And there are other places like that. So, while we enjoy the benefits of a global
business, there's no doubt that we would do better without these types of problems.
In regards to your other question about air in Europe, we have been experimenting with lots of different ways.
KAYAK is one of the ways in the past. We had a click-out to a part of a company called Etraveli that was – their
offering was called Gotogate. And we now have a more accomplished, more fulsome relationship with Etraveli
and doing a much more true integrated seamless type air product.

The difference between doing a meta with KAYAK and having it actually integrated as a true OTA offering enable
us the connected trip. You see, with all that data that we get from the actual conversion, all the booking data, all
the things the person is doing to be able to offer them some seamless and, we like to talk about, holistic offerings.
So, one of the benefits of something like this is you can offer connected trip car rental or other types of ground
transportation much more efficiently.
And I'd point out just as a separate – and this is not related to the air product because that is relatively recent, but
one of the things I'd like to see – what I like that we've seen recently is what's going on in our Rentalcars
business. And if you look at the statistical summary at the end of our release, you'll see that this recent quarter,
we've had a nice uptick in that car rental and that is partially due to the connected trip where we are now offering
that car rental much more connected with our Booking.com accommodations customers. So that's another one of
those instances where I see the connected trip beginning to come to fruition and see what we really can do.

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Glenn, I have two. So, the first one is sort of a bigger picture question. You
sort of talked about how you're witnessing slower growth in paid channels for a little while now. You guys look at
so much data. You have such good visibility into the market. Why do you think that's happening? Is it because
you're seeing a deceleration in people coming online and why is that happening? Are you seeing fewer clicks to
bid for? What do you think is driving this? And what do you think could cause a re-acceleration in paid channels
over time?
And then the second one, on the alternative accommodation business, any update or help on sort of how big that
business is now and how to think about its contribution to growth from a room night perspective? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So, talking about the paid channels, certainly, as people went online years ago, there was a much larger number
of people, I think, who were, particularly in the area that we really had some of our sweet spots, Europe and other
developed areas, people jumped online and they went to these paid channels. A lot of those people are already
there. Now, you start going to other areas of the world where people are going online, but they may not perhaps
go to some of our traditional paid channel areas.
I'll give you a perfect example. We talk a lot about China is a great opportunity for us for the long run. Google
does not operate in China, so all those new people coming online to buy travel, we've got to find another way to
get them. So that would be an example and there are other places like that. So I think that's probably the primary
reason for it.
Whether or not this will re-accelerate, let me know if Google is going to start having a full service in China and
other areas. That's one of the things that we know it's, in the end, what's most important is for us to get customers
to come to us directly. We've talked about this a lot in the past. It's one of the things that, I think, is very important,

for us to have our own future is to create a service that is so wonderful, so good, that people just naturally will
come back to us directly and we will not be dependent on other sources – we will not be as dependent on other
sources of traffic. What was your second question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

The alternative accommodations, sort of how to think about. Any help on its sizing from a room night perspective
or contribution to growth in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Well, we continue to talk about how it grows faster than our core hotel business and we're pleased about that. In
terms of actual sizing, we gave you some data a couple quarters ago. We're not updating that right now. And in
terms of the overall industry, there's a lot of data around the world, and I'll say the swing from the people who give
the lowest estimates to the people with the highest estimates is a pretty wide range, so I wouldn't even attempt to
try and come up with which one or where is the exact true number. We know it's a big business and we know that
it's an area that's important for us in the future. And that's why we continue to devote time, resources and money
to it.

Stephen Ju
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Q
Thank you. So, Glenn, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit about how the operating environment in
Southeast Asia may be changing especially as it regards to Agoda. You've been there for some time now and it
seems like, around you, online connectivity, adoption of e-commerce and payment frictions are all coming down in
the region which conceivably should serve as tailwinds.
So, are there any structural constraints that you can see that may slow the rate of adoption of online travel in the
region? And secondarily, just wondering how the consumers there behave. Is there a greater propensity to buy
packaged products versus hotels and air tickets separately, which may be informing your decision to, I guess,
invest in what is more of an intermodal product? Thanks.

Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So I would say that Asia in general is one of the opportunities for us for a very, very long time to continue to build
out our business and have good growth. And one of the ways one could look at that is Boeing and Airbus both put
together some very detailed 10-year projections, I believe they are – I think even further perhaps. And you just
look at the number of planes that they are going to expect to be delivered there.
Another way you could do it is look at the number of airports being built in the region. And those things all show
that travel is going to continue to be a growth industry in that part of the world, one. Two, the different ways that

people buy in Asia – and Asia obviously is somewhat of a generic term. It's different in different countries. What
happens in Japan is very different than, let's say, what's happening in say Vietnam. But there are some
similarities that I would say that we look at. And one is that price is very, very important. It is a very competitive
world out there in terms of price.
Also interesting, and I think we're all familiar with this, is that many people who are just coming online are skipping
desktop entirely. Everything is lived on the phone. And that's very, very important. The next thing is the super
apps that are prevalent there are very important in terms of how you're going to try and get business. If you're not
part of one, you're at a disadvantage.
I would also say that it's not just the super apps, but you see people who will go to many different apps to
compare price because price [indiscernible] (38:00). They'll actually download numerous different travel apps and
then go through each one, not the most effective or efficient way to find out what the lowest price is, but people
do, do that. These things are really important, and I would say that it's something that we're going to continue to
do.
David, anything else? David, do you want to add anything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
The only thing I'd add is that, whilst alternative payment methods is certainly something that's a function that's
happening, you see it happening around the world, you see more of them in Asia. And the ability to transact in
multiple currencies, pay in/pay out in different currency, particularly pay in for the travel point of view in alternative
payment methods is a factor that is more prevalent in Asia than elsewhere.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Absolutely correct. People in the developed areas of the world use credit cards. People in developing worlds are
using all different payment products. And it's very important that we be able to use every single one of them
because our customers are used to using those. They want to use those, and if we don't have them, they'll go
somewhere else.

Thank you. Couple of questions. It looks like pretty good ad leverage in the quarter. Just how do you feel about
the advertising situation as you look forward as far as your ability to drive direct traffic and need to spend and
maybe ramp up the brand campaign again? And then second, on ADRs, obviously, a headwind in Q4. Are there
any events or areas that really showed an inflection in ADR growth and something that would tell you this is very
temporary and could rebound? I'm just wondering how to think about that for 2020. Thank you.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So I'll talk about the advertising. David could talk about ADRs. So, in terms of brand advertising, and I've talked
about this in the last quarter, I would like us to be doing better. We are not spending as much at the beginning of
the year. I may have thought we would have, but as I've always said, we're going to be careful with our
shareholders' money. We're not going to spend blindly. We're going to always test and learn, and if I don't see the
results the way we want them, we're not going to spend until we get it right. So I'm a little disappointed where we
are.
That being said, it's okay. It's not terrible. It's just not as great as I would like it to be. I am very pleased that we
have a new CMO at Booking.com. He's been there for just a few months. And I am looking forward to working
with him very closely to come up with better creative and better campaigns in a way that we will achieve greater
results for our brand marketing. And that brand marketing is not only TV brand marketing, it's video, it's all of the
different things that one does in terms of producing a good brand campaign, and I am looking forward to doing
this going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Justin, thanks for the question. I'll give you a little bit more color on what's going on with the ADRs because there
are a number of factors, I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, but let me give you a little bit more flavor.
So, in the third quarter, constant currency, we saw about a 3% decline; in the fourth quarter, expecting about 4%.
When we look at that, about half of that decline is due to lower rates in key countries, and the ones I'd call out
would be US, Japan and Hong Kong being the largest contributor to that piece of it. And about half of the decline
is due to a mix shift towards lower ADR countries away from higher ADR countries.
Now, some of that is affected by macroeconomic factors, and those are impacting both rate and mix. Now, I'll
describe what they are and then I'll give you flavors to how we think they're actually playing out relative to just
underlying trends. So, for example, less China into the US is impacting ADRs in the US, the less inbound
international travel. So is less – and less expensive travel from Europe into the US due to the strong dollar, so
factors driving US ADRs on the rate level. Less travel from South Korea into Japan is impacting ADRs in Japan.
Of course, travel into Hong Kong generally is down considerably, that impacts both occupancies and ADRs there.
But these economic factors are also impacting mix as well. They don't only impact rate, they impact mix with less
travel into higher ADR markets. I mentioned US and Hong Kong are more traveled to some of the lower ADR
markets, for example, other markets in Southeast Asia. So, you kind of put all that together and many factors are
impacting these global ADRs, it's difficult to be exactly precise, but we estimate about half of what we're seeing in
the second half of this year is driven by external macro factors, and about half of it is due to just underlying
changes in our business. And remember also, we're comparing against two quarters where we saw unusual ADR
increases last year. So you kind of put all that together and you say, adjusted for that compare, our constant
currency ADRs are down about 2% in Q3, about 3% in Q4, and about half of that we can attribute to macro
external factors that should normalize over time.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Great, thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I just wanted to ask if anything has changed just in terms of your role
as Booking.com CEO as opposed to just CEO of the overall group, if anything's changed or just how you're
thinking about the business. And then any early learnings around the flight offerings in some of the newer
geographies that you're in. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So I'll answer the second one first. The flight thing is so early. It's literally just a couple weeks. There's nothing to
be said about that yet, but I hope to be able to talk more about it in the future.
In regards to the new role of being both the CEO of Booking Holdings and Booking.com, we talked about that in
the last call. And one of the things I pointed out was, because of my experience in bringing all of the companies
that are part of this organization in to be part of what was originally just Priceline.com and knowing all the
management teams and knowing what's good and what needs some help and where the strengths and
weaknesses are and personalities of the management teams, and boy, I felt that I would have a better opportunity
to try and bring together the company closer and help us work more efficiently with all of our assets.
And I'm pleased to say that I love the way things are beginning to come out the way is good for our customers
and our suppliers and our shareholders too. And I pointed out in my prepared remarks that Agoda and Priceline
working together created that flight offering for Agoda right now. And I mentioned a little bit of the nice thing that
we're seeing in our car rental business. We're, by integrating Rentalcars into the Booking.com operation,
beginning to see some upticks there.
I can go on and on and we're going to do – and I mentioned how we're going to have more of this cooperation
come up with new services because the connected trip requires us to be able to use all of our assets together.
I've always talked about the reason why OpenTable was not because we just wanted to have a reservation
system – a restaurant reservation system, but because we know every single customer traveling needs to find a
place to eat because they're not eating at home. And by putting these things together, all the data we have from
the travel part, all the things we know about what they like in terms of where they like to eat at home from
OpenTable and creating merchandise offerings to these customers in a holistic seamless way is just a much,
much better experience than going from site to site to site.
We have a center in Tel Aviv that has a whole bunch of machine learning experts, AI geniuses, who are all
coming up with different ways to put together the different offerings. And we're going to continue to push that
forward and that will create – and I said it earlier tonight, about the differentiated service that we'll be able to bring
people back with more loyalty to enjoy a better experience than has been experienced before. That's what I'm so
excited about, and seeing it to start come to fruition is just thrilling.

Eric J. Sheridan
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Thanks so much, maybe a few follow-ups on some of the topics you've talked about on the call tonight. In terms of
avenues of investment on the marketing side, how are you differentiating between driving desktop traffic versus
mobile traffic, and within mobile, web versus app, and where you're seeing highest ROI as you think about some
of those channels across investing versus driving conversion?
And then going one layer below to conversion, what are some of the big differentiators you're seeing that drive
higher conversion when you do see traffic to your properties? Is it the payments mechanism? Is it depth of
inventory, especially shared accommodations? Or is it some of what you talked about on the experiences on the
local side that might be areas where you want to invest additional layers to drive more conversion as we look out
not only the end of this year, but out over the next couple years? Thanks so much, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
We're not going to disclose much in terms of where we're putting the marketing money and which ones are giving
us the best ROIs. I think you'll understand our reticence to do that.
In terms of conversion, I haven't actually done – looked at the data, but I'm going to make a bet that the thing that
gets the highest conversion is having a great price. That's probably the number one thing that you can improve
conversion, if you offer a better price. I'm not sure how much more detail I can really go into here. I'll defer if
there's anything you want to add, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
No, conversion is a multi-faceted factor. Obviously, people look for choice. They look for convenience. They look
for support. They look for quality reviews. They look for just the quality and the trust of the site and the products.
And there's a lot of good data science that goes on behind testing all those and they all have a fact set. Good
news is that there are many levers that we can pull to [indiscernible] (48:29) improve conversion, as Glenn said.
Price and value is a key one as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
And I'll just echo what David said. And one of the things, again, that we do, and I think it is one of the advantages
of being a very large player who can afford lots of data scientists and spend a lot of money in trying to figure out
what is the best personalization for a traveler, whether this person has come before or even not, but we know
something about a cohort, to be able to really offer them something that is what they want to buy.
And that's something that's very important because if you just throw up a search result that has no relevance to
what they really want, you're not going to get much of a conversion. But because of the data we have, and we
have more data probably than most any other travel player around, we use that in a way to make sure that we're
offering up to our customer what they want. And that's how you can help create that higher conversion. They're
happier. It was an easy way for them to get what they wanted. That builds the loyalty. They come back. We get
more data.
And again, circling back to the connected trip, the more we learn about our customer, the more we're able to then
present to them all the things they want and to know if it's a leisure trip, what other things do they need, if it's a

business trip, what things do they need. And that is just such an advantage over a smaller player and it's an
advantage over any individual supplier in the travel ecosystem because they only see a small portion in their data
of what the person was. So, even the largest hotel chain doesn't know anything about their customer in terms of
what sort of ground transportation they want or what sort of restaurant reservations they like to make or what kind
of air they generally want to do and what kind of attractions they want. That's the advantage that a full OTA like us
has.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Heath P. Terry
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Glenn, I guess at some level this is a little bit more of a philosophical question, but it relates to the answer
that you gave on the brand ad spend question. But you grew revenues 4% this quarter. It wasn't that long ago that
the company was growing 25%. Given the margins you're generating and what you're spending on buybacks, it's
clearly not a question of resources. Are the incremental returns on investment that bad? Are you okay with longterm growth at these levels? Or is there a path back to 20% growth that you could see the company getting to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Well, I don't want to go to any specific number, but I do believe that it's important we create services that people
want to come back enough that we can accelerate. I'd like to do that. That's part of the reason we're making these
investments, and I think in the long run, the thing is creating that great service that gets us loyalty from the people
who currently come and keep coming, and then through creating that brand marketing of people who know this
better system and come to us and then use it.
It's one of those things that, in these network economies, that when you create something that really is differential
and better, the uptake can be very, very rapid. So, hopefully, and I believe we will be able to do this, creating
these better services, creating this better experience, being able to provide an opportunity for all of our suppliers,
this incredible breadth of suppliers in all different parts of the travel ecosystem, offering them an opportunity to
reach out to our customers in this merchandising way is different packages, different types of prices, different
types of value and being able to present it to, on the other hand, our demand side which is so huge, make it so
much better that then create that flywheel effect and have it start cranking up again. That's what I'd like to see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Heath P. Terry
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Okay. And is there – anything you can add just sort of on what you are seeing in terms of the incremental returns
in the areas of investment? Particularly, on brand advertising, this – as a percentage of sales, this is the lowest
you've spent in, I think, nearly three years. Given how important you've called out driving direct traffic is, I guess
I'm just surprised that you haven't tried to push that a little bit further.

Well, I guess – and you asked for philosophically and I'll go back to that then that philosophically I'm against
wasting money and I want to make sure that we're getting the return for the money we spend. And again, our
brand campaigns are fine. They're just not as good as I'd like them to be, so when I say I'm disappointed I'm not
saying they're terrible. I'm just saying they're not as good as they could be. Some of the brand health metrics that
we've seen have been good, some have not been as good. I am very excited though about our new CMO. He had
nothing to do with the old campaigns. These are new things that we're working on now and I'm looking forward to
seeing good results in the future with him.

Thanks, guys. You talked to these questions, but maybe I just want to parse out a little differently. David, you
highlighted direct traffic is growing faster than paid and, Glenn, you talked to the importance of – number of times
on the call, the importance in the continued focus on direct traffic. How would you assess the magnitude and/or
the quality of your direct traffic and the initiatives that you're exercising there? How much runway or leverage do
you feel you have to execute against getting more direct traffic into you? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, Brian, in terms of just quantification, just to recap. I think everybody knows this, but we've been clear that,
for a while, direct traffic has been over 50% of our bookings and continues to increase from that data point. So
that's where it is from a sizing point of view and continues to move nicely each quarter. I don't think we have put a
cap on where we think that can go. There will always be a mix.
We think that, as we said, the performance channels, albeit growing more slowly, are a very efficient way for us to
capture new customers, and we like what we see there. When we see growth opportunities, we lean into them
and we think it's a combination of both. And then of course, as Glenn said, the more we build the better flywheel,
the better the conversion will be from those performance-led customers into direct customers and repeat
customers. So that's the way the business kind of operates, but there's not really a lot of new data to give you
other than reiterate the points that we've already made.

more for/by owner or that less – or that inventory that's a little – that has a little more friction and bringing that over

to your site? Would that help your brand campaign in the US? And then any commentary on Ctrip investing in
TripAdvisor. Thank you.

Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So we talked in the past about how we think we are under-indexed in terms of the single property owner in the US
and we know that's an area where we need to add inventory to have a fully competitive source inventory against
people who want that type of a place to stay. We're keen to work on that. Obviously, we have a lot of different
ways that we try and bring people on to the site and make it less burdensome to have people come on. That's
something we're going to continue to do. It's blocking and tackling and we're slowly building it out. So that's the
best I can say there. It continues to grow as we continue to add that type of inventory into the website and the
inventory.
In regards to the Ctrip deal that we saw announced, look, we continue to create partnerships ourselves and we
have a good partnership with Ctrip and they sell our hotels and we make money and we're happy about that. We
also though set an agreement with Meituan, which is Ctrip's big competitor, and we have good business and we
have a good relationship with them too, and we have a relationship with Didi, which is another Chinese player.
And we have, as you know, we invested in Grab, as I talked about earlier, and we've put an investment into
another APAC player, Serko down in New Zealand, so we continue to make those kind of investments and
partnerships. It is not surprising that our competitors or other people in this space would also be thinking about
doing those type of deals, et cetera. And I don't begrudge anybody who wants to improve their own position. That
is the obligation of any corporation to try and improve their business for their shareholders, and I suppose that's
what they've done. But I have no details exactly about what the deal is, so I really can't comment on the specifics.

...question. Glenn, is there any way you can give us an update on your current transition to the merchant business
model here? And what is the coverage now relative to total market at this point? And maybe help us understand
which region you're seeing success. And do you also expect US hotel partners to adopt this model soon? And just
curious, given the slowdown in the market, is this business model giving you the price control to help you to be
more resilient during the current environment? Thanks.

Let me talk about the resilience about – in the travel business in general. In the past, when there have been
slowdowns, the distributors have achieved greater success because of the need for the suppliers to get more
customers. So that is something that we believe will happen again when and if there is a true slowdown. As I
pointed out, the industry is still, I believe, generally healthy around the world with pockets that we've described
earlier.

I do believe that, in the long run, the growth in the industry will continue to exceed GDP by a few points, and that
is the way we always play it out. So there's going to be always some ups and downs in the long run, but, yes, we
may gain a little more when there's a recession. And when occupancy rates are very, very high, there obviously is
less need for a person – distributor like us. But, in the long run, we'll continue to provide greater services and
greater benefits to both sides of this two-sided marketplace that will allow us to achieve the success that we think
we should.
And, David, anything about the merchant stuff?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
James, on merchants, and obviously just to clarify that the shift we're talking is the kind of rollout of the merchant
platform of Booking.com. At Agoda and Priceline, we do a lot of business on the merchant model already today.
And we – Booking.com, we continue to make progress. We gave you a data point a couple quarters ago as to
how many countries we're live in. We continue to add to that. We continue to add merchant capabilities in the US
and make those available to a wider range of our property partners here as well. So, continuing to grow, as I
mentioned earlier, mix increasing from 2018, but we're not going to give you a new data point on that just yet. At
some point in time, we'll give you an update.
So we're pleased with how that is progressing, and we're pleased with how it's giving us some additional flexibility
in the business. And of course, it's very important to underpin a lot of what Glenn talks about with the connected
trip because if you want to really have a connected trip, you want to also be able to connect and aggregate the
way that you pay for that and also be able to do things around packaging, pricing, payments, et cetera, through
and the merchant platform provides a mechanism for that as well. So we're pleased with it. It's making progress
today and it will be a bigger driver for us in the future.

James Lee

All right. If I may ask a follow-up question, Glenn, maybe help give us an update on your view on China. I know
you've been bullish for a long time. Now, given the fact that looks like global payments happening in China that
allow you to work with Didi as a way to provide additional service to the Chinese consumers domestically. And
maybe help us understand what other steps that you're taking to improve your service. Is it more the customer
segment type of strategy where you feel you have an edge in certain segment of consumer within China? Or is it
more the blanket strategy to go after big TAM in China specifically? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
And we've said this many times, how important China is in the long run. And yes, there's some economic
headwinds in China right now that have impacted travel in general there. And certainly, we've talked a little bit
earlier about some of the outbound impacts. We have a multi-leg approach. We do everything from building out
our own brands there to partnerships with OTAs like Ctrip or Trip.com as it's now known or Meituan or ground
transportation like Didi or many other B2B players where there's places where we can get customers. We have
almost 1,000 employees in China. We are doing all different types of brand marketing and other ways to try and
get people to see our services and get people to come to us directly or, as I just said, we also get customers
through the B2B method too.

I will emphasize though, China is a very competitive marketplace and we have to always be trying to create the
best services with good prices to be successful there. But we're going to continue to develop and work there
because we do know that, for the long run, we need to create something that will be, something that the
customers in China will want to use. And I'm pleased with where we sit right now, and I hope we continue to grow
in the future.

future, and we look forward to talking again in the new year. Thank you very much.

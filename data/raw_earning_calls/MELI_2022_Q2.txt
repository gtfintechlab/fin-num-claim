PART II - OVERVIEW & FINANCIAL RESULTS - PEDRO ARNT
Hello everyone. I am pleased to present some of the highlights and key messages regarding the performance in Q2 of 
2022. In a challenging macroeconomic scenario, we delivered a strong quarter across all of our businesses 
Our marketplace achieved consistent results despite the challenging environment for retail businesses, with a gross 
merchandise volume of over $8.6 billion dollars, delivering solid growth year on year, despite tough comps for Q2. 
We reached over 40 million unique buyers in the second quarter, with sustained levels of engagement and items sold
per buyer. 
With a diverse seller base and an efficient logistic network for a wide variety of items, we have a differentiated user 
experience and product assortment to keep growing and drive further online commerce penetration in Latin America.
On the fintech side, Mercado Pago continues to grow and gain relevance in our ecosystem, delivering strong results in 
Q2. 
TPV surpassed 30 billion dollars for the first time, growing both in Acquiring and Digital Wallet.
Mercado Pago reached 38 million Unique Active Users, growing across all geographies.
Mercado Credito continues to grow its credit book, reaching more consumers and sellers and delivering an important 
ecosystemic effect for engagement. With sustained healthy spreads in the second quarter, the credit business contributes 
to the operating margin expansion. 
As a consequence of the consistent performance in commerce and fintech, we delivered record results in Net Revenues 
and EBIT, with strong improvements in cash generation in the second quarter.
Revenues for fintech have surpassed 1 billion dollars in the quarter for the first time ever as our fintech products gain 
more relevance in our ecosystem. 
In commerce, revenue growth comes mainly from our strength in third party marketplace categories and the expansion 
of our Advertising business. 
Our gross profit margin expanded year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter as we scaled our businesses, and delivered 
operating leverage across most COGS.
 
Consequently, our operating profit reached a record in the quarter, with operating margins that were directionally in line

with last year’s, as we continue to balance investments, mainly in product, technology and the credit business, with cost 
leveraging across other operational expenses.
The second quarter closed with net profit in our three main segments, including Mexico, and with improvements in net 
income margin year-over-year. 
We also optimized our cash conversion cycle, leading to improved cash generation for all business units, and strong 
cash from operations results.
We will continue to target growth with the correct profitability and cash generation profile. This will mean balancing our 
focus on the long-term with a commitment to constructing sustainable businesses with scalable financial models.
The more detailed, customary commentary on the second quarter operational and financial highlights are now available 
in a management’ commentary letter to stakeholders, which we release on our investor relations website on the day of 
earnings and it’s accompanying material.
Before initiating the live Q&A sections of tonight's earnings call, we want to share with you some additional news and 
achievements from the last quarter.
PART III - OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Our marketplace continues to grow and technology has an important role to improve the experience of our buyers and 
sellers, deploying continuous improvements to selection, search and discovery. In our apparel section we now have 
improved filters and brand searching.
We also expanded the MeliPlaces network enabled for reverse logistics to improve the shopping experience for our 
customers.
We also keep improving our delivery service throughout Latin America. With 10 new aircrafts, the MELI Air network 
reduced our delivery times by 2 to 6 days in the North, Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil. 
In line with improvements in our buyer experience, our loyalty program has been growing, reaching millions of subscribers 
and strong year on year growth. After reaching Level 6, the highest on the program, users have higher frequency, GMV 
and retention, enjoying multiple benefits from free shipping, special discounts and offers to access to content streaming 
partners. Our loyalty program also plays an important part in connecting and raising engagement both in Mercado Libre 
and Mercado Pago, offering benefits in all of our services for our users.
On the fintech side, our Credit business also plays an important ecosystemic role, as a tool to provide our merchant base
with working capital, and our consumer base with Personal Loans and credit cards. 
To continue to provide these solutions for our ecosystem, we recently announced new funding partnerships to expand 
credit lines in Brazil and Mexico. 
All of these initiatives that potentialize our ecosystem are a result of our tech DNA and execution focus. We believe times 
like this are ideal to invest and create sustained long term differentiation leveraging technology and we will continue to 
invest in technology and in hiring engineers throughout the next quarters. 
As we grow, we watch closely our impact in the communities and environment around us. That is why we just launched 
another round of investments in our preservation program, Regenera América, in Brazil and México, to preserve latin 
american biomes and biodiversity.
As always, the best is yet to come.
THANK YOU

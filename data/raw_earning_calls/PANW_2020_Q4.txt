Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fiscal fourth quarter and 
full year 2020 results. I hope you enjoyed the video we showed you before. Our employees made that to 
celebrate how Palo Alto Networks has responded over the course of the year. I thought it would be a fitting start to 
everything we're talking about today.
As you can probably tell, we're delighted with our results this quarter and extremely thankful for the resilience that 
the team at Palo Alto Networks has shown in navigating the current environment. I cannot appreciate their efforts 
enough. I also want to acknowledge the challenges that people are experiencing globally as a result of COVID-19. 
This is a difficult time and we need to pool our strength and find empathy to get through it.
Before we talk about the quarter, I wanted to go back and remind you of the journey over the last two years. Two 
years ago, and my first and subsequent earnings calls, I've shared my observations about the cybersecurity 
industry. I talked about the need for integrated platform, need for setting platform with industry-leading solutions. I 
also talked about the need for us to become more relevant in emerging cloud security and the need to focus on 
AI, ML and automation. Two years later, we are well on our way to transforming from a single product category 
company to a three-platform company, a company that secures the network with Strata, secures the cloud with 
Prisma, and a platform for AI/ML applications and automation with Cortex.
We have been building products and acquiring new businesses to make progress towards our vision of providing 
integrated solutions. We are in the early stages of our journey but excited about the progress we've been able to 
achieve so far. The success of our transformation has strengthened our resolve to double down on the growth 
areas in cybersecurity and aspire to be the cybersecurity partner of choice, the partner providing integrated, 
comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers.
We've had several conversations over the last two years around our M&A approach. As you have seen, 
successful M&A is an integral part of our approach. We have honed a disciplined framework to ensure that the 
companies require our productive investment and that they fit well within our long-term strategy. We look for 
industry-leading solutions that prepare us for tomorrow, and we focus on integration and retaining key talent, 
talent that has beat all odds and build solutions designed for tomorrow.
We have been able to unlock value by activating our go-to-market and customer success machines with 
incremental technologies to accelerate the acquired businesses. When we analyze the performance of our 
acquired companies, we see that we are achieving our stated goal of increasing a given target company's internal 
business plan by 30% to 40% in the first 12 months of bringing them into the Palo Alto Networks family.
We recently reviewed the M&A history of Palo Alto Networks with our board. I'm delighted to report that the 
aggregate annual run rate of all businesses that we have acquired is four times what it was pre-acquisition. Just 
as important, we've also been able to retain the key talent that had helped build the acquired companies.
Let's look at some of the financial highlights from this quarter, starting with NGS. Two years ago, these collective 
offerings made up approximately 8% of our total billings. We closed FY 2020 with $928 million in NGS billings, 
representing approximately 20% of the total. Additionally, NGS ARR was approximately $650 million in Q4 2020.
Two years ago, we didn't have products that address the automation of cloud security markets. Today, we're 
doing multimillion dollar deals in these areas, creating a strong foundation for our future growth. This is one of my 
favorite slides. NGS is growing faster than any of the single-product newer public companies in the space.

Let's take a deeper look in the piece parts of NGS. Turning to Cortex. We drove incredible innovation during 2020. 
We established a new category by transforming EDR to XDR, delivering detection and response across not just 
endpoints, but also firewalls and cloud assets. In November, we introduced XDR 2.0, which featured a unified 
management UI, powerful new endpoint features and ingestion of third-party data and alerts.
XDR is rapidly gaining traction and is the fastest-growing product within NGS two win 1,000 customers. We 
recently added Managed Threat Hunting, the industry's first threat hunting service operating across integrated 
endpoint, network and cloud data.
Cortex XDR's momentum continues to accelerate, including a seven-figure deal with a major energy company 
that chose Palo Alto Networks as the key partner in their digital transformation journey. Cortex XDR helped them 
drive down the complexity of security operations by standardizing independent detection and response tools onto 
one superior platform. Through Cortex XDR, they were able to significantly reduce the number of alerts that 
needed to be triaged and investigated by the security analysts, all while gaining holistic visibility across the entire 
enterprise.
As security products get more real-time, it becomes more important to manage outcomes and respond rapidly. To 
aid our customers, we believe it is important to have a team of trained expert professionals to support them. To 
that end, we announced earlier today our intention to acquire The Crypsis Group, a fast-growing cyber consulting 
and incident response company. This acquisition allows us to serve current and new customers across a broader 
set of their cybersecurity needs. Once the transaction closes, Crypsis will bring strong incident response, 
forensics and consulting capabilities to our XDR portfolio. They have served more than 1,700 organizations 
across the healthcare, financial services, retail, e-commerce and energy industries.
In addition to being able to predict and prevent cyberattacks, Cortex will also now be able to mitigate the impact of 
any breach that our customers may face, thus strengthening Palo Alto Networks' position as a cybersecurity 
partner of choice for its customers. The Crypsis team, including the CEO, will join the Cortex speedboat.
Let's turn to Cortex XDR – XSOAR. XSOAR is the industry's first extended SOAR platform with native threat 
intelligence management. XSOAR more than doubled their customers and billings in the last year, making it one 
of the two leading solutions in the market. With the most recent launch of the XSOAR Marketplace, we're opening 
up the platform to both our partners and customers to enable automation for their security solutions.
One of the key wins I'm most proud to highlight for Q4 was an eight-figure Cortex XSOAR deal with a United 
States government agency. Cortex XSOAR was chosen as the cornerstone of their global SOC transformation 
initiative, resulting in a 75% reduction in their Mean Time to Respond by automating key security processes 
across the organization.
COVID further put XSOAR's real-time collaboration capability into focus, allowing the agency to rapidly shift their 
security operations to an entirely remote model, enabling them to defend the organization without any on-site 
personnel.
Let's shift gears to Prisma. Prisma Cloud has come a long way this past year. We started with cloud security 
posture management and expanded our capabilities into cloud workload protection with Container Security and 
Serverless Security. Prisma Cloud has by now acquired over 1,800 customers and boasts 14% of the Global 
2000 list.

Our integrated platform approach in cloud security is working. We signed a seven-figure deal with a Fortune 10 
company who will be using Prisma Cloud for both cloud security posture management and cloud workload 
protection. Several Prisma Cloud customers are consolidating multiple solutions with our unified cloud security 
platform. Today, a third of our customers are using both of these modules.
We will shortly launch new cloud security modules in data security, network security and IAM security. These 
modules will allow us to continue to execute on our vision of creating a fully integrated cloud security platform. 
Prisma Cloud continues to benefit from the overall global shift to cloud computing and the customer preference for 
platforms. We intend to work with our customers to continue evolve this platform to serve their cloud security 
needs.
Let's talk about Prisma Access. Prisma Access has been through an amazing journey in the last year. Combined 
with our recent CloudGenix acquisition, this is the most comprehensive SASE solution in the market. Prisma 
Access has become a powerful security tool as our customers go through a network transformation and create 
robust solutions for work from home for the long-term. This is showing up in our numbers.
With the combination of Prisma Access and CloudGenix, nearly doubling their customer accounts over the past 
two years and achieving $90 million in billings in our fiscal fourth quarter. We are very excited to sign a nearly 
eight-figure deal with a major health care provider for Prisma Access in the fourth quarter, winning against the 
competitor by providing clear evidence that our solution provides the most effective security for their needs.
Additionally, we saw a very strong conversion of Prisma Access trials that were launched in response to COVID 
and work from home. A notable example is a major enterprise that called us on the first Friday of COVID 
lockdown because their data center lacked sufficient bandwidth for all of their remote employees. By Monday, 
they had 1,000 users up and running and by Wednesday, they had shifted enough users that the pressure on the
data center was relieved. This quickly became their secure work-from-home solution and they are now looking to 
extend Prisma Access out to all branch offices replacing their existing provider.
We have many more similar examples of customers converting from Prisma Access trials, and we're delighted to 
have been able to help companies and the people remaining productive during these challenging times.
While NGS is an important part of our go-forward strategy, we are equally proud of our progress and success of 
our firewall business. Recognized as an eight time Gartner Magic Quadrant leader, we continue to relentlessly 
innovate to stay ahead of the pack. We continue to believe that firewall capability is essential and needs to evolve 
to deliver capability across all customer needs. Hence, we've been offering a consistent approach in our 
hardware, software and now containerized firewalls, and are also able to deliver them in the cloud with Prisma 
Access.
We introduced our new PAN-OS 10.0 that feature the industry's first machine learning-based powered nextgeneration firewall with advanced telemetry capabilities, the ability to secure containers, simplified decryption and 
many more groundbreaking features. To truly enable the firewall platform, we have worked on services that work 
seamlessly as part of our platform. The launch of IoT security subscription is our most recent example.
In the last 18 months, we have doubled our subscription offerings from four to eight, DNS Security, which was 
launched in Q3 2019 has been our fastest-growing subscription with over a 15% attach rate and now over 3,000 
customers.

Our software and next-generation firewalls continue to shine. VM-Series continues to capture new customers at a 
rapid rate with over 9,000 customers now using VM-Series, many of which are consumed through cloud 
marketplaces. And with the introduction of CN-Series, we can now apply next-generation firewalls capabilities to 
containerize environments in on-prem or in the cloud with consistent security and policy.
Turning to the topic of COVID-19 and its impact on both the global economy and our business, when we met with 
you to review our fiscal Q3 results in May, the pandemic was still in early stages. As we speak with our 
customers, we hear and see a range of impact and feedback. Many companies are becoming more cost and cash 
conscious, companies are also adapting to the new environment by accelerating investment in technologies to 
ensure the more dispersed work is secured.
I believe that we are in the very early stages of this acceleration and that the next several years present 
significant opportunities for cybersecurity as an industry and Palo Alto Networks in particular.
For our own employees, the second half of our fiscal 2020 was indelibly marked by COVID-19. We responded 
quickly taking rapid action to ensure the safety of our employees by establishing protocols and tools to work from 
home. We quickly gathered our early efforts and named it FLEXWORK, recognizing that we were in the early 
stages.
Today, I'm delighted to announce that we are launching the next phase of FLEXWORK to help our employees 
maintain health while being in productivity during COVID-19. The FLEXWORK program includes a broad range of 
initiatives including FLEX benefits and FLEX learn. These initiatives will ensure that our people can choose 
benefits that make most sense for their working family environments and follow personalized learning paths 
designed to help them do their jobs and manage teams remotely.
We plan to give our employees an additional allowance of $1,000 with the choice of various flexible benefits, and 
over time, we intend to individualize benefits, making them an employee choice. Even with all the challenges 
presented by COVID, the Palo Alto Networks teams have been able to adapt and maintain focus, allowing us to 
post some great results.
I know we cannot sit on the progress achieved so far and we need to focus on what is ahead. As I mentioned, we 
are pleased with our progress so far, yet we have a lot of work ahead of us. The macro environment, while better 
than we anticipated, is still uncertain.
Here is what you can expect from us in 2021, we will continue to invest in our next-generation security and 
security subscriptions, both through organic and inorganic means to continue our transformation journey. We will 
do so in a financially prudent manner as we have been able to demonstrate. We can expect us to manage our 
organic operating margin in line with what was achieved this year.
The work from home transition has created challenge in the industry around hardware, and we expect this trend 
to continue. We have been shifting our customers to software delivered security, and we plan to continue to do 
so. We expect most of our growth to come from software and services.
While there are some cost savings due to COVID, we are planning to reinvest those savings towards our 
employees. We'll be more generous over the coming years to drive this transition to a FLEXWORK environment. 
In the words of my friend Marc Benoit, we will be responsive to and support all of our stakeholders, not just our 
shareholders, because we believe that is how true value is created in the long-term.

I want to thank our amazing employees and partners for their contributions. Our success is only possible through 
our combined efforts.
Now, I want to take the opportunity to welcome Luis to Palo Alto Networks. Luis joined us almost two months ago 
from Amazon's AWS division and has been rapidly learning all things cybersecurity. We're extremely fortunate to 
have an executive of Luis' caliber to lead our CFO organization.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Luis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luis Visoso
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Nikesh, for a warm welcome. While I wasn't here for the first two years of the transformation, I can 
clearly see that it is working and we're only getting started. I'm encouraged by the value that Palo Alto Networks 
can create going forward. And I look forward to meeting you in the upcoming events.
Moving on to our results, I'd like to note that, except for revenue and billings, our financial figures are non-GAAP 
and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we had an 
extremely strong finish to our fiscal year with fiscal Q4 billings of $1.39 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year. 
Our next-generation security business is performing strongly with NGS billings of $357 million which grew 86% 
year-over-year.
Firewall as a platform billings, which includes physical firewalls, VMs, Prisma Access and CloudGenix grew 19%. 
In the fourth quarter, we beat our guidance across all guided metrics. Total revenue grew 18% to $950.4 million. 
For the fiscal year, we reported total revenue of $3.4 billion, an 18% increase year-over-year.
Looking at growth by geography, Q4 revenue in the Americas grew 18%, EMEA grew 20% and APAC grew 16%. 
Q4 product revenue of $305.6 million was flat compared to the prior year. Q4 subscription revenue of $389.8 
million increased 33%. Support revenue of $255 million increased 23%. In total, subscriptions and support 
revenue of $644.8 million increased 29% and accounted for 68% of total revenue.
Turning to billings, Q4 total billings of $1.39 billion, net of acquired deferred revenue, increased 32%, driven by 
strong execution across the company, work-from-home tailwinds and continued success in next-generation 
security.
The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter remained at 
approximately three years, flat year-over-year. We closed five additional Palo Alto Networks Financial Services 
deals enabling our business by offering greater flexibility to customers.
Our fiscal 2020 total billings were $4.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Product billings were $1.07 billion, a 
decrease of 3% year-over-year and represent 25% of total billings. Support billings were $1.21 billion, up 28% 
and represented 28% of total billings. And subscription billings were $2.02 billion, an increase of 40% year-overyear and represented 47% of total billings. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q4 was $3.8 billion, an increase 
of 32% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, we continued to add new customers at a healthy clip, adding approximately 2,400 new 
customers in the quarter. We also continue to increase our share of wallet of existing customers. Our top 25 
customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $55.3 million in lifetime value through 
the end of fiscal Q4 2020, a 35% increase over the $40.9 million in the comparable prior year period.

Q4 gross margin was 74.3%, which was down 320 basis points compared to last year, as some of our fastestgrowing products are still gaining the scale required to have a right cost structure and higher freight costs 
associated with COVID. We expect these headwinds to continue into fiscal year 2021.
Q4 operating margin was 19.8%, a decline of 180 basis points year-over-year and includes the impact of 
approximately $14 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisitions. For the full fiscal year 2020, 
operating margin was 17.6%, a decrease of 440 basis points year-over-year compared to fiscal year 2019 
operating margin of 22%, and includes the impact of approximately $23 million of net expense associated with our 
recent acquisitions.
We ended the fourth quarter with 8,014 employees. On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter, net loss increased a 
183% year-over-year to $58.9 million, or $0.61 per basic and diluted share. For the full fiscal year 2020, GAAP 
net loss increased 226% year-over-year to $267 million or $2.76 per basic and diluted share.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter decreased 1% year-over-year to $144.9 million or $1.48 per diluted 
share. For the full fiscal year 2020, non-GAAP net income decreased 10% year-over-year to $484.6 million or 
$4.88 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 was 22%.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of 
$4.3 billion. This includes net cash of approximately $2 billion raised through the June 2020 offering of convertible 
senior notes due in 2025. Q4 cash flow from operations of $333.7 million increased by 44% year-over-year. Free 
cash flow was $301.9 million, up 69% at a margin of 31.8%.
Capital expenditure in the quarter was $31.8 million. DSO was 81 days, an increase of 26 days from the prior year 
period, reflecting strong billings at the end of the quarter that will be collected in 2021. Lastly, in fiscal Q4, we 
completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction announced in February where we retired a total 
of 5.2 million shares.
For the first fiscal quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, an increase 
of 15% to 17% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, an increase 
of 19% to 20% year-over-year. We expect non-cash (sic) [non-GAAP] EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.35 using 
99 million to 101 million shares.
We do not expect Crypsis to have a material impact to Q1 results. Additionally, I would like to provide some 
additional modeling points. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx will be 
approximately $35 million to $40 million.
Turning to the full fiscal year 2021, I would like to provide a few markers on how we expect to perform. We expect 
billings to grow in the mid-teens and revenue to grow in the high-teens with product revenue flat to slightly down 
year-over-year. As Nikesh mentioned, we expect flat organic operating margins as we continue to invest in NGS 
and our employees during COVID times. EPS is expected to grow in the low to mid-teens, as we face headwinds 
from lower interest income.
Lastly, we expect our annual free cash flow margin to be consistent with 2020 margin. To note, we expect Q1 free 
cash flow margin to be higher than the year due to strong Q4 2020 billings.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. David, please poll for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
David Niederman
Vice President-Investor Relations, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Thanks, Luis. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question in the interest of time. Our first question will 
come from Saket Kalia from Barclays. And our second question will come from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saket Kalia
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here. And welcome, Luis. Look forward to working with you. 
Nikesh, a lot to talk about on the Next-Gen Security side, but maybe just to get it out of the way and touch on the 
core firewall business. Can you just talk about what you saw this quarter in terms of customers' appetite for 
appliances, and which attached subscriptions perhaps maybe surprised you to the upside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Well, Saket, thank you very much for your question. Look, as we've been talking about the macro environment for 
a while now. And a lot of customers are not in their offices. When customers are not in their office, it's very hard 
for hardware to be delivered or POCs to happen. So, we are calling that hardware is going to continue to be a 
tough business in the next 12 months. It – we saw appetite from existing customers who are expanding their 
state, who are getting more firewalls because they need more capacity.
You don't see as much new firewall business out there or new hardware business out there. So, we have to be 
very careful and cautious around it. But we are seeing that being supplemented by a lot more software-based 
solutions. So, you saw the success and strength in Prisma Access. You saw the success in our VMs. So we are 
seeing people step up and solve their problem using our software solutions more and more. And in case where 
they need more capacity for more VPNs or more remote users, they are expanding capacity of firewalls, or they 
are going through a cycle where there are some firewalls that are getting end of life, they are doing a refresh in 
those cases.
But in terms of subscriptions, I have to say, as I highlighted, DNS, which we launched in Q3 2019, has hit its 
3,000 customers mark. We are in the process of allowing subscription capability in the future on our software 
firewall format. So you will see us continue to drive the subscription thing. It's an early priority, but we have a lot of 
expectation from IoT, because we believe that's an important need from the enterprise perspective. So we have 
launched B1 with our most recent ML-powered firewall, and we hope to be able to add more enhancements to IoT 
and make a success out of that as well. This is hard, I can see myself. I'm not used to doing this on a earnings 
call.

And better understand, when we think about the kind of the overall firewall platform billings growing 19%, that's a 
very impressive number. Is there a substitution effect going on? And is there any way that you could quantify that 
in terms of people taking Prisma Cloud versus taking firewalls and maybe some substitution of dollars going from 
one side of the equation to the other versus product revenues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes, I think – thanks, Keith, for the question. I think, yes, there is substitution going on. If you look at the example 
I highlighted in the call, where one of our customers was running out of capacity in their data center to be able to 
remote secure access, and we went and deployed Prisma Access. They got 1,000 people live over the weekend, 
they got more people live by the end next – the following week, and now they're going to go put Prisma Access 
across their entire state, across all their offices, and that would have been a box sale. Two years ago, that would 
mean more boxes in their data center running EPM. So there's clear substitution going on. Prisma Access is 
substituting hardware.
Now I like it because: a, it's a software form factor, which means we can update and upgrade that software on a 
more regular basis and hardware, the customer has to do the updates and upgrades, and which is where the 
security risk comes in. So for us, having software form factors out there is a long-term amazing total cost of 
ownership benefit, not just for us, but our customers, allow us to keep updating security as we go on.
So yes, the substitution is happening. It's happening from the hardware format to the software format in the case 
of Prisma Access. Or take the case when a customer says as we at Palo Alto Networks, we have significantly 
shrunk our data center capacity. We basically shifted all of our own compute to Google Cloud or to AWS and 
when that happens, we're not deploying more hardware in our data centers, we're actually buying more cloud 
from the public cloud providers.
Now to protect ourselves in those situations, we're putting our VM-Series firewalls or our CN-Series firewalls in 
the future against our cloud incidence. And so that's, again, because we're moving to the cloud, we're substituting 
our own hardware purchases or our own hardware deployment with what is a containerized or a VM firewall. So in 
both cases, you're seeing the substitution happen. That's why we've been talking about this Firewall as a Platform 
number for the last 1.5 years, saying, look, pay attention to that number because when these substitutions 
happens some vendors, some partners or some industry players have some of those solutions not all of them and 
the virtue of us having all three form factors, whether a cloud-based firewall or a firewall that can operate in the 
hardware form factor or to Prisma Access or against the public cloud instance that allows us consistency and 
allows us to pitch the right firewall for the right situation.

Great. Thanks for taking my question, and hey, congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to focus in on just the goto-market efforts. I wonder if you can give us an update heading into this fiscal year, how you fee about sales 
productivities, sales capacity and also just the incentive structure? And anything you're changing this year, any 
priority focuses for fiscal 2021?

Nikesh Arora

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
It's – I don't want to use the word unprecedented because I think it's been used too often. But launching it – right 
now, we're going through our sales kickoff. It's – we've gone from a three-day event, which used to be physical 
last year in Vegas, and I'm not missing Vegas. But is turning to a six-week learning journey and we're 
instrumented everything online, where people have to go through the learning process, and they're going to 
upload their video pitches up into a platform and each of them are going to rate each other and critique each 
other.
So, we are all learning with the times in terms of how to go sort of initialize a sales force in new fiscal year. And I 
think, we're – our teams are doing a really good job of making that happen. So from that perspective, I am not 
concerned about our ability to go out there and create the opportunities from our sales teams. I think the real 
question going into next year is how do we continue maintain the momentum. And as I've said, we intend to keep 
investing in our transformation that we've done so far with next-generation security. We're all very pleased.
If you'd asked me at the Analyst Day two years ago, what did – a year ago, what did I think where the biggest risk 
was? My biggest risk was, can we get to $805 million of billings for next-generation security because they're all 
sort of somewhat fledgling businesses we bought. We're going to integrate them. We're going to go and convince 
customers that this is the right way to go buy cybersecurity. And $928 million of billings which us was a welcome 
surprise also for us in a good way, our teams love the products, our customers are loving the products.
So we're just going to try and keep that momentum going into next year. All of our sales tweaks or commission 
tweaks or go-to-market tweaks that we make are going to be aligned towards meeting the objectives that we set 
out to ourselves. So, we're hoping not to make any major shifts yet keep doing and investing in the direction that 
the teams have shown success in so far.

Walter H. Pritchard
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Hi, thanks. Yes, I am here. So just a question on margins, I guess, you took on pretty significant margin dilution in 
fiscal 2020. Could you help us understand the puts and takes around margins as we head into 2021? And 
especially, you've seen that revenue on those acquisitions, it sounds like, ramp quite a bit and take care of some 
of that dilution. Can you help us understand where the incremental investments are going relative to keeping 
those margins flat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes. Well, I think if you think about the success in NGS, so what we did was we deployed a speedboat model, 
which was we created a dedicated sales team that was helping us sell Prisma Cloud and helping us sell Cortex 
and Cortex XSOAR. And now what we're doing is we're trying to; a, keep that momentum. We saw that we grew 
that number 105% and that requires us to make sure we continue to invest in our sales team which can actually 
go compete with some of the other players in the market and go into hand-to-hand combat for some of the larger 
deals.
What we've also done is we're deploying that capability across our entire core sales team what they are able to 
take the products and done with it. So we track very carefully how people are spending time and how much of our 
new products they are able to sell. So we're glad that the proportion of our sales teams that are able to sell nextgeneration security continues to rise, which is a good thing. But we continue to hope to make investments in that 
direction.
The other part, which Luis alluded to, is that as we see ramp-up in next-generation security because there is 
significant amount of deployment expense and consulting expense, which is a one-time expense that happens 
early in the life cycle of us deploying this product, you see that we have some compression in the first year of the

margin, both on the gross margin, the operating margin, both sides when we deploy the services. So it's really –

Fatima Boolani
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Either for Nikesh or Luis, nice to meet you. I 
wanted to drill into your fiscal 2021 outlook. Appreciate sort of the high level trajectory of the key metrics in the 
business. But as I triangulate between near triple-digit growth in your NGS portfolio, which is now a fifth of the 
mix. As I think about the software business contribution accelerating and even substituting for hardware. I'm 
wondering, what's maybe underpinning some of your conservatism on a mid-teens outlook? We'd love to get 
some of your puts and takes and your thought process behind that outlook relative to the 32% you did this 
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luis Visoso
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Thank you for the question. Nice to meet you. I think they are – we should take into account two factors. 
One is the strong performance of Palo Alto Networks, right? So we're performing very strongly and you see that in 
our Q4 results and you see that in our guidance in Q1. But we – there is still a lot of uncertainty out there and we 
want to be prudent as we give guidance for the year or as we set up framework for the full year. So we just want 
to be prudent as we think about it just given the uncertainty.

Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. So I want to drill into the acquisition of Crypsis. So we're watching FireEye actually 
separate their product business from their services business. And I just want to make sure, is there an intention 
with this acquisition to have the incident response actually drive follow through purchasing of product? Is that 
what you're looking to accomplish with it or is it a different strategy in terms of the acquisition?

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Sterling, that's a great question, and I would not comment on FireEye. But we have noticed when it comes to 
XDR, the customers are both excited about having a managed capability around it, as well as you've noticed that 
in the case of incident response, typically, if you have a good set of products and those products help you protect 
in that or help you diagnose during that incident, the customers are reasonably keen on deploying those products 
on a larger scale.
We've experienced that with XDR even without having incident response team. We've been called in by many of 
our large customers in certain cases where we've gone on a sort of – on a partnership basis gone and helped 
them in the case of an incident or in the case of a breach. And almost all times, invariably, we – the customers 
had actually embraced XDR and deployed it in large numbers.
So we've noticed that, and we believe that, if we had a team that was being sort of canvased and asked to come 
in and do – help in, in this case, Crypsis has done 1,700 such responses from an incident perspective, we think 
the upsell or cross-sell possibility for XDR, if it's the right product, in that incident is huge. So we think this will 
significantly allow us to amplify our success in XDR in the future.

Thank you, Nikesh. Good question, Catharine. What we have seen relative to the cloud providers is they – it's 
very important to them to have a set of security capabilities that helps remove certain obstacles for getting
customers to consume more and more cloud, but not necessarily going to the level of true enterprise class. And I 
think that's the underpinning of our success with VM-Series and the just recently released CN-Series, Prisma 
Cloud as well. We're really focused on bringing the enterprise-class capabilities that our customers expect in a

much more tightly integrated fashion and being able to then take those capabilities and go multi-cloud as well as 
hybrid cloud.
And so, one of the key differences in our approach is our ability to support our larger customers as they have 
multi-cloud strategies, whereas the cloud providers themselves are almost by definition going to be single cloud in 
their solutions.

Patrick Colville
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Q
Hey, thank you for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. Can we just talk about the products, fiscal 
2021 kind of color you gave? I appreciate the world is changing. We're going to more software-driven world, 
nonetheless hardware. But the guidance you gave is suggestive of kind of market share bleed to Fortinet and 
Checkpoint. And so just any thoughts around does that matter, are you guys now more focused on the kind of 
software components? Just to help us, I guess, get your thinking around the hardware side and what used to be 
the core business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes. I think, Patrick, thank you for the question. I don't get to the same conclusion. So the way we think about the 
firewall platform, as you see, we consider a situation where we sell Prisma Access could have been a hardware 
situation. And if you sold Prisma Access with CloudGenix and SD-WAN solution, we think that's a like-for-like deal 
where we're not losing market share. And the reason we've been talking about Firewall as a Platform for last yearand-a-half or so is, when we look at market share from the firewall perspective and say, am I selling more 
firewalling capability than the industry growth rate, I think the industry growth of firewalls is in the low-single-digit 
range. And if we can deliver Firewall as a Platform growth rates in the high teens, that's a good outcome for us.
So, we grew Firewall as a Platform at 19%, industry profit grew 3%, 4%. We think we took share. I took share with 
software, which I think is, in the long term, much better outcome for us, because it allows us to keep our 
customers in a better situation. And also, it's not a hardware-dependent business where there's more risk.
So, we don't – you don't get to the same conclusion on loss of market share. As long as I'm growing Firewall as a 
Platform in the ranges that we have, I think, we're taking share, we may be shifting share to the earlier question 
from hardware to software, but we don't have any intention of losing any share to anybody in the market. 
Hopefully, we intend to gain share in the market. And I think you have to look at it more holistically across what 
Zscaler is doing, what Checkpoint is doing, what Microsoft Firewalls are doing, what our firewalls are doing.
And if you look at that as a total firewall market, we want to be growing that – share that by. And even in the 
current environment, as I've said, it's very hard to go deploy hardware or sell hardware to customers because 
many of them are not there in the office to take delivery and do a proof-of-concept even. So, we're delighted that 
we have software form factor to be able to sell them in this environment and deploy them remotely because that's 
what the customers are looking for right now.

Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to drill down a little bit more into Prisma Cloud and some of the 
newer offerings that you guys discussed relative to data security, network security, and IAM. Are those products 
going to be from Palo Alto exclusively? Would we expect you to partner with some of the other vendors in the 
market? And any incremental color in terms of timing or functionality would be appreciated. Thanks.

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So I'm going to give you a perspective, and I'm going to ask Lee to jump in and talk about the modules. Look, one 
of the points of view we have taken as we deploy our next-generation of products, whether it's cloud security or 
Cortex, we have tried to make sure that we give the customers the best-of-breed integrated solution for cloud 
security.
So, when we bought RedLock, we bought Twistlock and PureSec and Aporeto, we made sure they were 
integrated into one platform. The way we sell it is we go to a customer and say buy credits. Our customers buy 
credits to use our products. And we keep introducing these new modules within our product and as the customers 
experience our product, they start exploring these new modules and start using them, which keeps decrementing 
credit.
So, we're trying to create scale from a go-to-market perspective and provide them the best capabilities. So, 
towards that end, the 1,800 customers we have for Prisma Cloud, these customers are borrowing from on-prem 
versus cloud versions, they will have the opportunity of experiencing every one of our modules without having to 
come out and buy it from us. They would already have it as part of the product. And if they choose to use it, they 
will decrement their credits faster. So, that's our strategy.
And towards that end, we believe that the true benefit for the security solution of the customer as well as for us 
economically is if we don't have to go do a sort of a sales role every time that we are launching a new module 
because we believe cloud security is not fully developed as a platform, so we will have seven modules sometime 
later today, and I'll let Lee talk about the future functionality and capability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes. So, one of the very strong points of feedback we're hearing from our customers with Prisma Cloud is our 
ability to give them both breadth of capability as well as depth in those capabilities is really resonating. They like 
the strategy of an integrated platform, delivering an increasingly comprehensive set of cloud security capabilities 
that they need.

So with that in mind, these three new modules that will be coming out we expect this fiscal quarter are really 
exciting. The first one is data security. So, this is effectively applying both DLP as well as malware scanning to 
cloud storage. To cloud storage, basically data breaches is one of the big challenges a lot of customers deal with. 
And this module will aim to address and fix that.
Second is a module focused on web application and API security. So this will play in the sort of the WAF and 
RASP market categories. And fully integrated leveraging the exact same agent that our customers have already 
deployed when using us to do container and serverless security. And then IAM security, which is focused on the
cloud credentials that customers have in a really big challenge around over provisioning and commissioning of 
those credentials.
And so this will give visibility as well as security around how to lock those down with the right security policy. And 
then tying this back to what Nikesh said, as these new modules are available, our Prisma Cloud customers will 
simply be able to start using them and decrementing the capacity as already purchased from us making the –
turning on and using these new modules super simple.

Brian Essex
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, I just had a quick question on OS 10 and saw that 
you released it a few weeks ago. And I was wondering how meaningful that cycle should be relative to other 
releases. Is that something that customers are going to get automatically with their subscription? And how might 
we expect this to be rolled out throughout your installed base? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So the – obviously, super excited about the release and all of the capabilities, the ML-powered next-gen firewall 
really just infusing machine learning into the core of the product. I'd say to begin with any of our customers who 
have a hardware device or software form factor are able to use it. However, they need to be on some of the 
newer hardware platforms. So this will incent some customers who are still on older generation of hardware to 
want to upgrade in order to get these capabilities.
Second, this is the release that will unlock some of the newer subscriptions we talked about, including IoT 
security. And so there will be added incentive for our customers to get to 10.0 in order to take advantage of these 
new subscriptions.

Brent Thill
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Great. Nikesh, over the last year, you're now approximating well north of $800 in M&A. We appreciate the 
payback that you gave us, but kind of just maybe give us a sense, do you expect this pace to continue? Or do you 
feel like you need to digest what you have now and you've got the core pieces to achieve would you like go 
forward at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Brent, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we have followed a very disciplined approach. We look at –
we're constantly looking at new cybersecurity capabilities in the industry. As you know that as soon as "antidote" 
is found towards a cyber breach tactic, the hackers start working the next way to try and figure out how to hack 
the customers.
So we have to be constantly on the lookout. And we've taken a very, very proactive point of view that we don't 
want our customers have to go integrate these solutions themselves, which is what causes the chaos in 
cybersecurity. So we've stepped up and said, we're going to become more and more comprehensive player in 
areas where we believe we can add value. So we're not going to – we don't see value in going after old red 
oceans where there's enough players in the market. And we're not trying to create a place to get everything. 
We're trying to get to a place where the product that we deliver or the platform we deliver has all comprehensive 
capability.
And as I've said, cloud security is not fully evolved because we are all moving to the cloud and discovering across 
the entire process. And our customers are having to integrate some solutions, that's why we've chosen to acquire 
some companies but also build these next few modules that Lee highlighted internally organically because we 
believe the cost of integration will be higher than doing the organic development ourselves.
So we just – we're constantly on the lookout to make sure that we are solving the problem with customer. We will 
continue to stay in the lookout, Brent. And all we're trying to highlight is that we're not – we're very in thoughtful 
when we do M&A. We look at it both from an economic and a product perspective. And so far, our track record 
has shown that we are able to significantly accelerate the capabilities once we acquire these companies, both 
from a go-to-market perspective or a product perspective and we're going to continue looking at the market from 
that lens.

Great. Just with Strata, can you talk a little bit about where you are seeing the fastest growth in terms of that 
product set? And could digital transformation maybe create a second wave of security investment around the CNSeries and some of the other products in Strata?

Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Hi, Jonathan. So to your first question, where we're seeing the fastest growth? I mean, I think obviously as you're 
seeing, we're seeing great growth across the platform. We talk about Firewall as a Platform and inclusive of 
Prisma Access and the newly integrated CloudGenix, Prisma Cloud, certainly with the recent acceleration of the 
shift to cloud. Prisma Cloud has been a fantastic cloud security platform have available for our customers to help 
them in that shift. And Cortex is really gaining traction both around XSOAR and XDR.

Great. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. And this will be our final question.

Brad Zelnick
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Q
Thanks so much for fitting me in and congratulations on the momentum into Q4, very impressive. I've got an easy 
one for you guys. I just wanted to ask about the spike in DSOs. So it's completely natural to understand why this 
quarter you would see the month of July being so heavily back-end weighted. But if you were to normalize and 
assume a more normal linearity to this Q4, how much of this is because of extending payment terms, if at all? And 
what are you seeing with customers and their need to spread out payments? Thank you.

Luis Visoso
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes, that's an easy question, as you said. No, we do not expect any – from any structural changes. We do expect 
to get back to normal levels in Q1. This is how our billings came in Q4, but we don't expect this to be an issue 
going forward.

Brad Zelnick
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Q
Okay. Thank you.

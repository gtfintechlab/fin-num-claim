Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc.
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We executed well this quarter 
against challenging industry conditions. Despite weakening demand for our 4G solutions, fiscal third quarter nonGAAP earnings of $0.80 per share was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by improved product 
margins, lower R&D and SG&A and a lower tax rate.
In QTL, following the district court's ruling, our licensees continue to perform under their agreements. In parallel, 
at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we are pursuing a partial stay and appealing the ruling, of note, with a 
statement of interest of the Department of Justice in support of our stay motion, stating that QUALCOMM is likely 
to succeed on the merits in the appeal.
The Huawei export ban, along with the pivot from 4G to 5G which accelerated over the past couple of months, 
has contributed to industry conditions, particularly in China, that we expect will create headwinds in our next two 
fiscal quarters. As a result of the export ban, Huawei shifted their emphasis to building market share in the 
domestic China market, where we do not see the corresponding benefit in product or licensing revenue.

In addition, our customers in the China market are working through their existing 4G inventory and deemphasizing 
their second half 2019 4G launches, as they shift their priorities to their 5G launches in early 2020. As a result, we 
do not expect the typical seasonal benefits given this unique market dynamics.
By the first calendar quarter of 2020, we anticipate reaching the inflection point as our financial results begin to 
reflect the benefits of our substantial efforts over the years to bring 5G to the market worldwide. Let me walk you 
through the dynamics of 5G rollouts. 5G network rollouts are progressing at a much faster rate when compared to 
4G. We expect over 20 operators to launch 5G service and over 20 OEMs to have 5G devices in the first 12 
months after the first commercial launch. This compares to four operators and three OEMs with the launch of 4G 
with the major difference being that China is launching 5G in the first year.
In China, 5G commercial service was officially approved in early June and our current estimate is that by the end 
of this year, the three operators will deploy roughly 100,000 5G base stations, which to put in context is the 
equivalent of the scale of the entire network of a large U.S. wireless operator. And in the U.S., 5G is being 
deployed across sub-6 and millimeter wave for nationwide coverage.
Verizon has noted that they expect three quarters of the phones they are launching next year will be 5G. AT&T 
announced that they are on track for a nationwide 5G coverage in mid-year 2020 and we expect a proposed TMobile-Sprint merger to result in an accelerated nationwide 5G rollout. I would add that we expect millimeter wave 
to be a mandatory requirement at all major carriers in the United States.
Also helping to drive this accelerated transition to 5G is dynamic spectrum sharing which enables carriers to 
dynamically repurpose 4G spectrum for 5G use. DSS is a game changer for the carriers and will result in a much 
more rapid proliferation of 5G than we have seen in prior G transitions.
Before I talk about our products, I would like to remind you of our contribution to develop the fundamental 
elements of 5G including innovations that enable massive MIMO, millimeter wave, security and the deployment of 
5G technologies in networks across broad spectrum allocations. This early work has resulted in a valuable IP 
portfolio and provided us with early insight into what products need to be developed and commercialized at scale. 
This will continue as 5G expands beyond Release 15 and the feature sets continue to evolve.
Today, we are the only chipset vendor that has 5G system level solutions spanning both sub-6, gigahertz and 
millimeter wave bands. This is key to global deployments. Our 5G system level solutions span baseband, 
transceiver, RF front end and antenna elements as the components are tightly coupled together for best-in-class 
performance, spanning multiple KPIs including power area and modem benchmarks.
Let me now give you an update on our OEM traction. All of the major Android OEMs have announced 5G devices 
for this year and as volume ramps in early 2020, device offerings will expand beyond premium tier devices. As an 
example, China Mobile plans to drive 5G devices to price points under a U.S. dollar equivalent of $300 by the end 
of 2020, representing about 40% of the Chinese smartphone segment by price band. Our Chinese customers 
have recently made product portfolio decisions consistent with that carrier objective to drive 5G into lower price 
bands.
On the product side, our 5G design wins have doubled since our last earnings call. We now have over 150 5G 
designs launched or in development using our 5G chipsets. In addition to core chipsets, virtually all our 5G design 
wins are powered by our complete RF front-end solutions for 5G sub-6 and/or millimeter wave. We are the only

company today delivering an end to end comprehensive modem to antenna solution. The complexity of 5G and 
the value innovative solutions enables us to expand our ASPs significantly from 4G.
Turning to more detail on our legal matters. On July 8, we filed our motion for a partial stay with the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals. And as you may have seen, the Department of Justice on behalf of the United States filed a 
statement of interest that supports our request. We cannot predict the exact timing, but we expect the Court of 
Appeals to rule on our stay motion in the near future. In the meantime, as can be seen from our results this 
quarter, licensees continue to perform under their agreements, consistent with our view that the District Court 
decision does not nullify the existing license agreements.
On our appeal on the merits of the FTC matter, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the request for an 
expedited briefing schedule. We expect briefing to be complete by the end of the calendar year, and the court has 
said it will schedule the case for oral arguments on the next available hearing date, after briefing is completed.
With regards to Huawei, we continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of the dispute, focused on a final 
agreement.
Turning to QCT, on July 15, we announced our QUALCOMM Snapdragon 855 Plus mobile platform, providing 
about 1 billion mobile gamers a leading flagship option for pro-like gaming devices.
Expanding on our China relationships, we are pleased to announce a strategic cooperation with Tencent to 
deliver premium 5G and gaming experiences to consumers and developers in China and other regions. This
cooperation includes joint efforts on Snapdragon-based mobile gaming devices, Snapdragon Elite Gaming, cloud 
gaming, AR, VR and always-connected PCs.
We continue to execute on our growth opportunities across automotive, AR/VR, connectivity and networking and 
IoT. In compute, we are on track to see the first Snapdragon 8cx-based designs to launch in the second half of 
calendar year 2019.
In summary, while near-term demand trends are not surprisingly soft as the entire market and industry transitions 
to 5G, we are very excited with our design wins and growth in device content as 5G ramps, particularly into 2020. 
Put simply, our position at the center of developing this incredible technology represents a large opportunity for 
our stockholders.
I would now like to turn the call over to Dave.

Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered third quarter GAAP revenues of $9.6 billion which 
included $4.7 billion related to the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers. GAAP EPS was 
negatively impacted by a $2.5 billion non-cash charge to income tax expense due to a write-off of a deferred tax 
asset, resulting from recently issued U.S. tax regulations.
Our non-GAAP revenues were $4.9 billion despite top-line softness. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, at the high end 
of our guidance range due to better QCT gross margins, lower combined R&D and SG&A expenses and a better 
than expected tax rate. During the quarter, SG&A expenses benefited from a faster than expected reduction in 
excess litigation expense.

QCT delivered revenues of $3.6 billion on 156 million MSM shipments, below the midpoint of our guidance range 
given a larger than expected impact from market weakness. QCT's EBT margin was 14%, in line with our 
guidance, reflecting improvements in both gross margin and lower operating expenses.
QTL's third quarter revenues of $1.3 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range, and 
included both current period Apple royalties and the last $150 million interim payment from Huawei. Our third 
quarter QTL results reflect the view that post the ruling in the FTC case, our licensing agreements remain 
enforceable and our licensees are expected to perform under their agreements which they have done to date. 
QTL's EBT margin was 70%, above the high end of our guidance range on lower operating expenses due to a 
faster than anticipated reduction in excess litigation expense.
Turning to our outlook. As Steve mentioned, as we look forward over the next couple quarters, our business is 
being impacted by several factors in advance of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020. We see continued 
weakness in China demand, Huawei gaining share inside China and our Chinese OEMs managing their inventory 
ahead of 5G. We are lowering our estimates for global 3G, 4G, 5G device shipments in calendar 2019 by 100 
million units to a range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We now expect handset shipments to be down mid-single digits 
year-over-year.
In China, through the June quarter, while device shipments from handset makers into the carriers and retailers 
was down only 5%, the device sell-through from carriers and retailers to consumers was more pronounced, down 
approximately 20% year over year, reflecting in part a pause by consumers ahead of 5G and an uncertain macro 
environment. As a result, we have seen a meaningful build in channel inventory during the first half of calendar 
year 2019.
Over the next two quarters, we expect a significant impact on device shipments as sell-in and sell-through growth 
rates realign and channel inventory levels are drawn down in China. In other regions including North America and 
Europe, we are seeing lengthening handset replacement rates impacting unit volumes as well as some softness 
in India and in non-handset devices.
Further, as a result of the trade dispute, our business is being impacted by a shift in OEM share towards Huawei 
as they increase their focus on domestic China sales and to a lesser extent by the loss of direct sales to Huawei 
affected by the trade ban. Lastly, we are seeing our Chinese OEMs respond to these factors by pulling back on 
new 4G device orders and managing their inventory in advance of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenues to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion 
and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.75. For QCT, we estimate MSM shipments to be in the range of 
140 million to 160 million units, down 4% sequentially at the midpoint. Historically, we have seen mid-teens 
percentage growth in MSM shipments from our third to fourth fiscal quarter reflecting normal seasonal strength in 
the latter part of the year as OEMs build for the upcoming holiday seasons. The estimated lower MSM shipments 
in our fourth quarter are being impacted by the factors I just described.
The China related weakness is particularly impactful to QCT revenues due to our leading position with Chinese 
OEMs in the premium and high tiers. We estimate QCT's EBT margin for the fourth fiscal quarter will be 13% to 
15%, flat sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate QTL revenues will be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion 
with EBT margins of 62% to 66%, down sequentially versus the third quarter. Our fourth quarter forecast does not 
include any revenues from Huawei with the last interim $150 million payment recognized in the third quarter. 
Similarly to QCT, QTL is not seeing the typical seasonal uptick in our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting weaker 
device shipments.

We expect non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense to be down 1% to 3% sequentially, reflecting the 
absence of the catch-up and employee bonus expense that occurred in our third quarter, offset by an increase in 
R&D spend. We plan to remain disciplined around cost management and expect operating expenses to increase 
slightly from our fourth quarter run rate as revenues ramp through fiscal 2020.
We estimate our fourth quarter GAAP tax rate to be 16% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be 13%. We believe the 
13% rate is a good proxy for both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates going forward.
As an update on our share repurchase activity, as of today, we have completed approximately 90% of the ASRs 
at an average price of approximately $64 per share. As a reminder, we expect to complete the ASRs in early 
September. We are estimating 1.21 billion weighted average shares outstanding for the fourth fiscal quarter and 
expect to exit the fiscal year with approximately 1.16 billion shares outstanding post the completion of the ASRs.
Looking beyond the quarter, we expect these market headwinds impacting our business to continue through the 
remainder of the calendar year and expect our revenues and earnings in our fiscal first quarter of 2020 will be in a 
range similar to our fourth quarter forecast. We are optimistic that 5G will be a catalyst to market improvement 
with broad rollouts of 5G networks globally, including the U.S., China, Europe, Korea, Japan and Australia. We 
expect 5G device volumes to ramp more meaningfully in early calendar 2020 with new flagship device launches 
from global and Chinese OEMs supporting 5G.
In QCT, as we transition to 5G, our addressable dollar content opportunity per device is up to 1.5 times greater 
than a comparable 4G device, given greater chipset complexity and our ability to capture 5G RF front-end 
content.
We remain confident in the incremental $2 of EPS related to the longer term contribution from the agreements 
signed with Apple as product shipments ramp. And one final comment, we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor 
Day in New York on November 19 this year. Please stay tuned for further details.
Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please 
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James E. Faucette
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask, you've mentioned that a couple of different forces that are 
impacting demand for QCT right now, both Huawei's more internal focus on China as well as pause in demand 
ahead of 5G. Can you talk a little bit about how that is impacting not only unit volumes, but the pricing and mix 
currently? And then how you're looking at the impact on, at least qualitatively, your anticipation for 5G volumes, et 
cetera, next year, especially since we seem to be coming off of a lower base.
Then as a follow-up, can you just talk a little bit more and give a little more color on how you may be handling any 
requests for renegotiation per the FTC ruling and what the roadmap is that you've laid out for those licensees in 
terms of treating those requests and dealing with compliance in the interim? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Sure, this is Dave. Let me start and Cristiano will jump in. So if you think about the dynamics in the market, we 
called down the market 100 million units. A meaningful portion of that is related to China where we're seeing 
softness. We referenced in the comments the sell-through market to consumers being down 20% year-over-year 
through the first half of calendar 2019 and our sell-in at down 5%.
So we see the back half of the year a convergence of those growth rates, so the sell-in rates coming down more 
aggressively in the back half of the year. That in the back half of the year is compounded by some runoff of 
channel inventory that's been built up over the first half as well. And so some pronounced impacts on really Q3 
with respect to the channel inventory runoff. And so we think that the market dynamics in the market units flow out 
a little bit in Q3 and then hitting our Q4 and our fiscal Q1 as those dynamics play out.
And the way to think about how that impacts the business is first you think about QCT. We typically would see 
from a seasonal perspective maybe a 15% to 17% increase in MSM shipments as we move from Q3 to Q4. I 
mean obviously we guided down 4%. So if you think about jumping off from 156 million MSMs in Q3, that gap 
from what we would normally expect to see is about 35 million units. About two-thirds of that is market related with 
China being a meaningful component of that.
I would point out that a lot of the China dynamics and certainly the things related to pause before 5G are more 
premium and high tier dynamics that are more impactful from a revenue perspective for us. And the other third 
would be really share shifts, those OEM share shifts towards Huawei away from some of our OEMs as well as a 
little bit of share loss at the low tier, but that's not really sort of financially impactful. So that's I think the way to 
think about the impacts on the next quarter or two here.

Jim, this is Cristiano. Just to add some additional color. So building what Dave had said, if we remember I think 
China got authorization to launch 5G back in June. And so there was a lot of uncertainty whether they will launch 
or not given the environment. They did launch. And what we seem to some counterintuitive, but actually building 
confidence on the 5G transition is we had some of the OEMs cancel some of their 4G launches and moving their 
portfolio toward 5G designs. We're seeing a lot of requests for pulling in and we see the preparing for the 5G 
ramp at the next selling season.
And when we do have this I will say one-time impact, as Huawei demand got suddenly reduced in Europe, there 
we saw an increase focus of Huawei in China. That kind of changed the OEM mix. But the general sentiment, and 
that's what we're seeing in the activity, is to drive as fast as possible to the 5G ramp as we bleed this inventory on 
the premium and high in the channel and we're seeing 5G ramping across multiple tiers as Steve said even at the 
price points at $300 and above.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander H. Rogers
Executive Vice Presdent & President, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Jim, this is Alex. On the second part of your questions, how are we handling requests for renegotiations. As you 
may have seen, we have had a number of requests for renegotiations come in. We've also had license 
agreements that were in the process in renegotiation recently. And with respect to those requests, we're ensuring 
essentially what we call a FRAND process, that the licensee has an opportunity to drive to a fair reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory result in any license agreement that's ultimately reached. And so we're engaging as we always 
do very thoroughly with licensees to try to get to a process that recognizes the value of our portfolio, which we 
think is very, very good as 5G ramps.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please 
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Caso
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Yes. Thank you. I guess first question is on the sell-through versus the sell-in expectations over the next couple 
quarters and understand what you guys said on the revenue expectations for you that take into account some of 
the inventory adjustment that's going on. But what are your expectations for sell-through? Does it stay at this sort 
of down 20% year on year rate as we get into the 5G transition at the beginning of next year? What's embedded 
in the guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, essentially what's in our guide is we are expecting sell-through to remain low through the rest of the 
calendar year, reflecting as we said sort of some of the macro environment, but also really some of the pause 
before 5G ramps more meaningfully next year. So we expect that to remain low and then the sell-in to start to 
converge towards that over the remainder of the year. And then that's just as we said compounded by the fact 
that there's been some channel inventory build, built in the first half that will bleed off. That's more of a Q3 
probably factor.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Caso
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I guess we understand that you're hoping to get a stay in the FTC 
ruling. Could you lay out for us what the contingency plans are in the event that a stay is not granted? What are

the steps that would need to be taken and what would be the financial impact of having to take those steps before 
appeal is finally decided?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald J. Rosenberg
Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Chris, this is Don Rosenberg. So as you know, we are smack in the middle of the Court of Appeals reviewing 
our motion for a stay. So we're limited in what we can say about that. But I should point out, I don't think it's 
missed your eyes that it's fairly widespread consensus that Judge Koh's order is erroneous in many, many 
respects. And the fact that the United States, the Justice Department with the support of the Department of 
Defense and Department of Energy have filed a brief, statement of interest rather, in support of our motion to 
stay, in which among other things they objected both to the remedy, but also indicating that they think we're going 
to be successful on the merits.
In addition, the Court of Appeals has expedited their review of our appeal on the merits. And so I think we're very 
encouraged by this kind of support. We think as I said that there is a widespread view that our chances are very 
good. So we're at the point where we want to wait for that decision on the stay and then proceed from there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander H. Rogers
Executive Vice Presdent & President, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
This is Alex. I'll just add very quickly. One of the I think fundamental points that can't be missed is that the current 
agreements are valid and enforceable. Even the FTC has weighed in and said that the agreements are not 
nullified. And so that's very important. In addition we have a couple of what I would call anchor agreements that 
are very good agreements that we're quite happy with and that's Samsung and the recently signed Apple 
agreement. And as I've said our IP position is very, very strong through 4G and ramping into 5G.

with your question.

Blayne Curtis
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on Apple's purchased Intel's 
modem and then as you think longer here, it sounds like Huawei's focusing more on post this ban or attempted 
ban here, focusing more internal on their modem. I know you've shipped to a portion of that, so I'm kind of just 
curious. Any view on how this Apple purchase affects the $2 you guys talked about? And then if you can just 
comment on Huawei and if they gain share and do more in-sourcing, the opportunities for you as you go into 5G.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Blayne, this is Steve. I'll handle the first one and Cristiano I think is going to jump in on the Huawei question. I 
would say in terms of the recent news flow, there's really, I think that was pretty highly anticipated. It was clearly 
anticipated in the agreement that we did. Remember we did two agreements, a patent license agreement as well 
as a product agreement, multi-year product agreement.
We don't see anything changing in terms of our ability to deliver on those agreements and we think it still remains 
a pretty competitive, or at least an attractive competitive dynamic for us when you look at the industry and our 
roadmap versus others even after those agreements expire. And I think very clearly in answer to your question, 
we don't see any impact to the $2 number that we have put out there.

Hi, this is Cristiano. So on the Huawei, Huawei has been now a number of years that their premium and high tier 
has been focused on their own silicon. I think our shipments to Huawei is always like in the mid to low tier. But I 
look at the Huawei focus on China a little different. I think it creates an opportunity for our customer base coming 
out of China companies like Vivo, Oppo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi outside China, especially in Europe that's accretive 
to us especially in the 5G transition. And we look that opportunity as probably permanent, not one-time. I think the 
interest on the European carriers have been very high.
And when some data came out that we're very pleased that show since we're kind of generations ahead on our 
5G chip, I think the latest report show that the Huawei modem is at least 50% bigger in area than the first 
generation QCT. At I think we had compete with many other companies throughout the years and we're optimistic 
about the lead we have on 5G. And hopefully, that will drive a good transition for us, for our customers in China 
including competing with Huawei domestic China as well.

Samik Chatterjee
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with kind of a question on 5G. You're clearly excited 
about your position in 5G, but as you kind of think about the impact on the smartphone industry, you're expecting 
volumes to improve, but lowering the cost of the solution also there's probably going to be a big driver. So how 
you are seeing kind of progress on that front?
And just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned kind of 20 operators you expect to launch 5G. Can you just help us 
think about the mix of sub-6 versus millimeter wave? And you mentioned you would expect millimeter wave to be 
mandatory. Kind of what's driving your view there given what we hear is the infrastructure is not really ready to 
support millimeter wave in most geographies yet? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Samik, this is Steve. Maybe I'll take the first one and Cristiano will jump in a bit on the RF components. I would 
say, I would look at 5G rollout in general has a higher intensity and a more global nature than what we saw even 
in 4G. So the pressure that we are getting to accelerate not only the premium tier, but also higher tier devices is 
pretty immense.
If you were to look, China Mobile came out with a data point that said essentially RMB 2,000 devices, roughly 
$300 phone, that will be where they're going to target the 5G line next year pretty substantial by the end of the 
year. That's a pretty substantial move. I would expect at the beginning of the year, which is what we're really 
focused on right now, you'll start to see that line be somewhere close to the RMB 3,000, so roughly $400, $430 
price point. That's pretty significant actually. And it's anticipated in our roadmap in terms of our integration. You 
may have seen us and remember that we have talked about how we have been moving 5G into an integrated 
roadmap even more quickly than we did in 4G.
Now two things happened to us that I think are beneficial in addition to just the good dynamics that happen when 
you have transitions in technology. One is because the complexity of 5G goes up, the ASP of the baseband, we

tend to have an attractive move just from the ASP of the baseband alone tier to tier. So 4G same tier to 5G same 
tier, the ASP of the baseband is good for us.
Secondly, we see a strong opportunity in the RF to grow the content of a device. As you know, we've had strong 
traction there in part because of the importance of wrapping the system design around the antenna. You will see 
consistent with the design that I mentioned, or the feature that I mentioned dynamic spectrum sharing, you will 
see an opportunity to extend those 5G RF design opportunities into the legacy 4G bands as they are effectively 
dynamically refarmed with that feature.
So we see a continued roadmap for us to continue to grow content per device and that's why we've been 
investing so heavily to put that in place. It's in place now, and the real activity for us is how quickly can we get this 
to ramp and can we do it worldwide. So we're pleased with that, I would say the dynamics. And we have a lot of 
visibility into that. We have a lot of confidence that we think that we're going to be able to do it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, so Cristiano. Just to answer your question about sub-6 and millimeter wave mix. So millimeter wave right now 
is a requirement across all the main carriers in United States. I think we saw phones get launch with millimeter 
wave. And in 2020, we'll see that in Korea and Japan.
So if you look at the developed economies, I think the Japan market, Korea market and the States market require 
millimeter wave. There will be no high attach in terms of the total 5G volumes. But it's not stopping there. So 
Europe, that is launching with sub-6. Millimeter wave has already been auctioned in Italy. And it is now likely to 
get licensed in the UK as well. So 5G's really been designed for the combination of sub-6 and millimeter wave. 
And we are optimistic about millimeter wave attach increasing.
One other thing to mention is sub-6 in general, we will see in 2020 a lot of refarming on existing spectrum 
because of the dynamic spectrum sharing technology. So that also create opportunity for us to expand our RF 
front-end that today is focused on 5G, these new sub-6 band and millimeter wave to also add the refarm bands. 
So, and that's how we think about the RF.

Hi guys. When you say that there is slowdown in the 4G versus 5G, is it only China-specific? Or can you give the 
global context of this comment? It's just hard for me to believe that there is any slowdown in Europe or the U.S. 
because of 5G. So I want to understand it.
Second, can you comment on the relationship with Apple, post the acquisition of Intel's modem business by 
Apple? How do you view it? And where do you see yourself kind of in the future playing with Apple? Kind of how 
do you work with Apple, given that they're going to have a modem asset in-house? Thanks.

This is Dave. I'll start. So let me start with China. So we are seeing a pause or a slowing in terms of 4G orders in 
advance of 5G in China. Really there's a number of, as we reference, a number of dynamics going on in China 
right now. There is a sort of a realignment of the sell-in towards the lower sell-through growth rate, so some 
compression on growth rates in the back half of the year, the channel inventory being drawn down.
And so headwinds for the OEMs in terms of the market in the China in the back half of the year. And then what 
we're seeing is an element of the softness in the sell-through market really being attributable to more high and 
premium tier segments of the market pausing before 5G. So we are seeing that, some of that pause before 5G 
and a desire by some of our OEMs try to accelerate efforts to bring 5G into the market, so seeing that there.
Outside of China, we referenced lengthening replacement rates in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe. 
And so, we think a little bit at play there as well in terms of some pause again at sort of the higher tiers in advance 
of 5G.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
And Tal, this is Steve. With respect to Apple, I think the relationship is quite good. What really characterizes it now 
is the 100% of the intensity is about how do we get products out together, very natural I think for both companies. 
We, and I think both sides really anticipated that there would be some announcement like you've seen. But it 
hasn't changed the way in which we move forward. We're used to that and the real effort is how do we get 
products out together and I think that's a very healthy relationship.

Ross Seymore
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Hey, guys. I want to talk about the 5G side. You're clearly excited about the first half of next calendar year. Can 
you talk a little bit through, do you think it's going to be more of a unit demand environment where that's really 
going to rise? Or is there going to be more of a substitution effect there? And people on the sell side and buy side 
should more focus on that 1.5x increasing content that you talked about, Steve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, Ross, I think as we look out over the next year and the transition to 5G, we don't really look at it in terms of 
being a unit growth story, where the market units increase. What we really see is in a flat market, the transition 
over to 5G creating an opportunity for us by the fact that our monetization per phone is going up, as Steve 
referenced, as wee see higher rate ASPs associated with the complexity as well as the capture of 5G RF frontend content. And so it's really more about that as a growth driver for us as we head into the first calendar quarter 
next year and on into the rest of fiscal 2020.

Ross, this is Cristiano. I'd like to add the following. When you look at the first half, just the launch of 5G by the 
operators and how unlimited data plan starts to move to the 5G devices, we'll see that replacement and with that 
you do see this 1.5 factor coming in as we grow content and RF front-end. Over time, it's hard to make 
predictions, but we've seen this with every different transition. Some of the new services, whether video or gaming

or streaming gaming starts to become more popular and device form factor changes for a larger screen, you 
could see the market growing faster than single digit. But we're not making that assumption for 2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ross Seymore
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
That's helpful. I guess as my follow-up question, sticking with the China theme in general, can you give us an idea 
whether it's your QCT revenues or the MSMs, any sort of even rough estimate about the percentage of those that 
are associated with China, because the year-over-year growth rates you're talking about, or declines in this 
instance are quite acute. I know in the September quarter you had 14 weeks last year and some things have 
changed and you walked through the inventory dynamics. But even if I adjust for those, it seems like you're down 
the better part of 15%, 20% year over year. So to the extent China is such a larger exposure for you, can you just 
talk about how big is it? And is there anything you can do to help mitigate these sorts of booms and busts as we 
go into that first half of 2020, when the count, the 5G ramp could lead to this same sort of volatility?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, a quick comment on year over year, so if you look at where we are year over year there's a couple of 
factors that affect the decrease, or the reduced level of revenues. One, I would remind you that last year there 
was significantly more Apple in our business versus the current quarters. So that's a meaningful portion of the 
decrease in revenues on a year over year basis. We also had some low-end share loss over the last year that had 
some contribution to the reduction as well, but Apple, a big part of it in terms of QCT.
On the QTL side, just to highlight it, in the year ago quarter, we had $500 million from Huawei compared to $150 
million in the current quarter. So, overall that contributes to the comparison also.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
And I would just add one – this is Steve – I'd just add one. I think you have an unusual event here, which was the 
reaction of Huawei to the ban and how it retrenched into China. And I think that was a very unusual share shift 
that obviously we got impacted probably more than other folks just because the tiers and the OEMs that were 
impacted are ones that we tend to monetize. We think that gets back in a more normal position, kind of snaps 
back the other way with the launch of 5G. And hopefully, wouldn't have a one-time event like that, but it should be 
more stable post that big ramp with 5G.

Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A couple of additional question on China, one from each side of the 
business. I know, Steve or Cristiano, I know you've talked a little bit about the Huawei retrenchment and the 
impact on QCT units. It's been topical that obviously China after the Huawei entity list stuff and other factors has 
maybe focused more as a country on indigenous development. Have there been any movements for high silicon 
to supply any other OEMs in China or for OEMs broadly to source from China?
And then on the QTL side, since Judge Koh's ruling, any change in compliance with Chinese OEMs outside of 
Huawei that we should note? Thank you.

Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way to think about it, Huawei had a sudden change in their phone 
landscape, especially what happened in Europe. I think there was a drastic reduction in demand. And I think that 
causes them to be very focused on China, because that's the place they could be focused on. I think the big 
picture answer to your question is China has many initiatives and their initiative with China is not only about China 
domestic market, but also how the Chinese mobile system grow outside China.
And what we have seen, it's our relationship with China remains very healthy and is expanding, and in addition to 
the relationship with Vivo, Oppo and OnePlus as they range in Europe, we recently signed an agreement with 
Tencent talking about content in 5G use case development. And I expect that the relationship between QCT and 
China in the 5G era will continue to be healthy, because we help the expansion outside China. And that's how we 
look at. We don't see any signs today that the dynamic is changing.

Alexander H. Rogers

And then this is Alex. On the QTL side, there was, as we've referenced, one incident that would have affected 
compliance and we engaged very rapidly on that, took it very seriously. But as you can see as of the end of the 
reporting here, we've got good compliance.

Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the QCT trajectory. So, I know you talked about 
inventory flush and some of the weakness and everything else. But at the same time, if I look at your forward 
guidance on chipsets, I mean you've been missing for the last several quarters, so why all of a sudden is it 
inventories in a pause in front of 5G versus just a continuation of the trend that we've already been seeing for the 
last three quarters or four quarters?
And for my follow-up, I just want to know, do you guys think 5G overall is accretive to licensing revenues? I mean 
you lowered the rate when you included it. You have the ASPs capped. It doesn't sound like you're looking for 
incremental unit growth for the market for 5G. So, how do we think about 5G's impact on the run rate of royalty 
revenues given where it is today? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hey Stacy. Yeah so, with respect to the QCT side, first of all, I would make the comment that stepping back over 
the course of this year, I think with the recent 100 million unit reduction, we've seen a sort of a continuing erosion 
in the handset market over the course of this year. So, this has been something that has been a headwind for the 
business I think for the last several quarters. And so I think that's been a dynamic that has been impacting MSM 
units as well as sort of the overall business.
I think what we're seeing now is maybe a little more pronounced growth impacts on the back half of the year as 
again we go back to the sort of the sell-through rates remaining down in China and the sell-in rates really not yet

aligned with that. So realignment there, the fact that they weren't aligned in the first half resulting in some channel 
inventory build, so really more market dynamics in terms of pressure on units.
As we said, a little bit of share loss at the low end, not financially significant. And then the more I would say 
unique situation with Huawei really entrenching and focusing on the domestic China market and really putting 
their attention there and grabbing significant share. So, that little bit more of a unique situation to what we're 
seeing right now. But I would say a lot of it is, really is attributable to the market headwinds that we've been 
frankly seeing all year long.
And then QTL, with respect to how to think about that as 5G as an upside, a lot of the agreements we sign are for 
4G, 3G, 4G, 5G. And so really we look at it as just a continuation and extending of the monetization of the 
handset market as it evolves from 4G to 5G just like we did from 3G to 4G.

Mitch Steves
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a quick one just kind of turning back to the ASPs expected if 
we're going to ramp 5G faster. So, I guess two parts. So first, does this mean that essentially we're going to see 
kind of a bigger pause in smartphones shipments and then that's going to increase demand for the kind of the 5G 
shipments out in 2020? And then secondly, if that's not the case, what should we think about as a kind of a 
normalized unit base for the smartphone industry at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yes, so in our comments when we talked about the 100 million unit reduction, we kind of gave a sense it's 1.7
billion, 1.8 billion units in total. We indicated that now translates into a handset market being down sort of midsingle digits year-over-year. And so if you look, if you step back over the last number of years, it's been a 
relatively flat handset market, so down a little bit as we see some of this pause and some of the macro 
environment impacts affecting us. So we don't really see any sort of changes in the overall unit market beyond the 
comments that we made.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mitch Steves
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Yeah, just to clarify real quick, I don't think I did a good job asking that question. I was referring to more to 2020. 
So essentially, if people are pulling down the numbers for this year, does that mean essentially 2020 should be up 
like 7% or 8% to kind of offset this being more of a down year or is that too early to call that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yeah, probably too early for us to call what we'll see in 2020. But I think we would expect to, as we said, see an 
inflection beginning in the first calendar. So it would be our second fiscal quarter with 5G launches happening 
more significantly in China as well as other flagship device launches at a Mobile World Congress and things like 
that and then sort of building over the course of the year as we think about moving towards really more flagship 
launches happening in the fourth fiscal quarter.

stuff and just ask if you could update us on the CFO search, kind of what the status of that is. And then I also 
wanted to come back to just the demand stuff, just to kind of clarify what information you're acting on? So are you 
seeing – did you see deterioration of demand through the quarter? Could you just kind of talk to us about what 
sort of data points you've seen here and how they came to you? Did things weaken toward the end of the quarter 
or they just remained weak? Or want to give us some idea of what trajectory looked like to you? Thank you.

David E. Wise
Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Interim Chief Financial Officer, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Then with respect to sort of how things have unfolded I guess more recently. So one, I think we track like the 
CMRR report. I mean, we track that like probably a lot of others in terms of watching what's happening with the 
sell-through. And so we've seen that continue to be down even through the June quarter with really no significant 
movement away from that trend. And then we look at that relative to kind of where we see handset demand 
coming in with respect to sort of our own data points around the market. And so we look at it from that standpoint. 
We look at our demand profiles coming in from customers in QCT and factor that into the mix as well. And that's 
where we've seen some of the pullback that we talked about with respect to 4G units.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Atlassian’s Head of Investor Relations. 
Ian Lee: 
Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian’s Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On the 
call today we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, our 
Chief Financial Officer James Beer, and our President Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and 
commentary for our third quarter of Fiscal Year 2018. These items are also posted on the Investor 
Relations section of Atlassian’s website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there is also an 
accompanying presentation and data sheet available. 
We’ll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A. 
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance 
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements 
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking 
statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s 
beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. 
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the Company’s financial results is 
included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the 
section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Forms 20-F and 6-K. 
In addition, during today’s call we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial 
measures are in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS 
financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS 
measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is 
available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and our updated Investor Data Sheet on our IR
website. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. 
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Good afternoon. Thanks everyone for joining today. We had a great start to 2018. This quarter we grew 
revenue 40% year-over-year and generated over $86 million of free cash flow. We also added 6,587 net 
new customers, the most we’ve ever added in a single quarter and a big step towards our goal of serving 
the Fortune 500,000.
In February we kicked off the Atlassian Team Tour where we’ve been unveiling product updates, sharing 
the latest in team practices and discussing the future of teamwork with almost 3,000 users and partners.
We’ve almost completed our tour across 11 cities worldwide, and it’s been fantastic to speak directly to 
customers and hear about the different ways teams are using our products. We’ll be making our final stop 
in Tokyo on May 23rd.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
This quarter, we announced the opening of our newest office in Bengaluru, India. This new location will 
add to our world-class R&D and customer support centers around the world.
As part of our earnings today we announced two exciting updates to our Board of Directors. First, we are 
pleased to announce that Shona Brown has been appointed as the new Chair of the Board. Shona has 
been a Board member since November 2015 and has been a great mentor to Scott and myself. We were 
also excited to welcome Sasan Goodarzi of Intuit to our board. Sasan brings with him almost 15 years of 
experience driving product leadership and growth at Intuit, and will be a valuable addition to the Board.
Finally, we’re pleased to have our new CFO James Beer on the call with us today. James joined the team 
in February and will play an important role for Atlassian as we grow past $1 billion in annual revenue.
With that, I will pass the call over to the Operator for Q&A.
Operator:
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, 
then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before 
pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. 
The first question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Alex Kurtz:
Thanks for taking the question, guys. Stride, any kind of adoptions trends you saw in the quarter, 
announced newer product and maybe how you see that playing out over the next six months or so.
Scott Farquhar:
Thanks, Alex. This is Scott here. Just a reminder for everyone here on the call, Stride is our 
communications product that we built entirely from the ground up to put voice, video and team chat into 
one product. As we know, the communications space is sort of a large and nascent space. 
With Stride, we’re still in the early learning mode with our customers, and we don’t have adoption metrics 
but we are getting a lot of feedback from our early users.
James Beer:
This is James. I would just add that I don’t expect Stride to be a material revenue driver in Fiscal ’19.
Alex Kurtz:
Thanks, guys.
Operator:
The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
Hi. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about trends on the deferred revenue side 
and deal signings, and I was wondering if there was anything you could share with us about the linearity 
of deferreds in the quarter and if there’s anything you could share with us about how customers maybe 
might be seeing the price increase in the market. Thank you.
James Beer:
Let me start with that. In terms of the deferred revenue, obviously I’m sure you know about the price 
increases that we announced in August of last year and some of our customers took advantage to pull 
forward, either their maintenance renewals; in some instances new business, upgrade business and so 
forth, and so that benefited Q1 and Q2, and so we saw the other side of that effect in Q3 as we saw that 
pull forward revenue that otherwise would have played out in Q3.
The other thing I would mention, particularly about Q3 deferred revenue and so forth, is of course this is 
the first full quarter of Trello. We’re now lapped the acquisition that occurred midway through Q3 at this 
time last year.
In terms of the price increases, we very much feel as though the effect is on track as we expected, so 
that’s going along very much as planned.
Heather Bellini:
James, could I just ask a follow-up, if I may, about Q4 deferred revenue trend. If the early renewal slightly 
impacted Q3, should we be expecting that to also have a seasonal impact on Q4 just as we think about 
setting our models?
James Beer:
I think that pull forward effect is likely to decline as the courses go by, so I wouldn’t want to overstate the 
effect that you’ll likely see in Q4 there. No, I think that will be a more in line, if you will, in terms of the run 
rate around deferred revenue. 
One of the other factors that we have to think through is obviously the cloud business is growing very fast 
and so you have to think about the mix of whether our customers are electing the annual subscriptions or 
the monthly subscriptions.
Heather Bellini:
Okay, great. Anything you could share with us on what they electing? What’s the trend in the annual 
versus monthly?
James Beer:
Well, it moves around. We’re pleased with the response to both. I think what’s important is that we’ve got 
options out there for our customers. We’re really addressing their needs in a variety of different ways.
Heather Bellini:
Thanks. Thank you very much.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Bhavan Suri:
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I was going to touch a little bit on Service Desk here. Just, you 
know, as you’ve seen customers and partners start to deploy it, it has now been a little while it’s been the 
fastest growing product for a while, just some color on sort of this sizes of deals and sort of are you 
starting to see them expand? Then just touching on a couple of cases where we’ve chatted with partners 
where you see coexistence with service now, just sort of an idea of how that exists and also as you view 
that as a potential replacement over time.
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Hi Bhavan, it’s Mike. I can take that one. Look, as we’ve said before, JSD is growing very quickly and 
we’re very excited about its opportunities in all sorts of fashions inside of enterprises. We do see the 
growth is both in small and large accounts. Obviously in the larger accounts there’s potential to go further 
afield because the size of the company it’s greater, the amount of service opportunities between teams is 
larger, so we do see a correlation with larger businesses, obviously moving it into other functions outside 
of IT. It moves into Finance, HR, Legal, lots of different teams. Interactive Marketing is a particularly 
popular one. Any team that tries to help other teams is a part of their team’s job. We’ve disclosed more 
than 25,000 organizations use Jira Service Desk and it continues to be one of our largest products 
alongside Jira Software and Confluent.
We do see Service Now. We do come up against it occasionally, but by far the largest is attacking of 
greenfield opportunities. As a reminder, they target kind of the Global 2000 and we’re the Fortune 
500,000, so more often than not you see very happy coexistence in a lot of different ways, and they 
probably see us far more than we see them I would suspect.
Bhavan Suri:
A quick follow-up just on product investment. You obviously talked about the new location in Bengaluru, 
but as you look at product investment, R&D spend I guess, how should we think about sort of the split 
between sort of optimizing and enhancing (inaudible) product, and sort of newer stuff you might be 
working on that maybe you haven’t sort of built out, so either gaps in existing products or brand new sort 
of sets like Stride, what would that mix be? How do you think about that sort of in the long term? Thank 
you.
Scott Farquhar:
Bhavan, it’s Scott here. One of the things we’re really proud of is our investment in R&D and turning that 
into valuable products for our customers, and we’ve done that for 15 years and that’s not going to 
change. We’re going to continue to invest in R&D because that drives our business more than other 
competitors or other companies that drive more sales driven approach (inaudible) with R&D, so that’s not 
going to change.
The relative amount we spent on optimizing and enhancing changes from year to year, I’d say this year 
with some of our move to AWS we probably spent a bit more on kind of internal rearchitecting, which has 
shown more sort of infrastructure benefits for our customers, reliability, speed, latency. We can put data 
centers close to our customers, scale, so those types of benefits is what our customers get from those

infrastructure investments. Now that that’s happened, we’ll be doing more investments in sort of more 
front-facing user features. It changes from year to year as we listen to customer needs.
Bhavan Suri:
That’s very helpful, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question.
Operator:
The next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
George Iwanyc:
Thank you for taking my question. Impressive new customer additions. Can you give us a sense of where 
they’re coming from? How much from Jira and other products?
Jay Simons:
Hey George, this is Jay. We don’t break out individual products. I think the story of the customer count 
was just the business overall was firing on all cylinders. I think especially on the cloud side, all Core cloud 
products drove strong customer adds, and remember the number in the quarter, the number between 
quarters is going to move around a bit from quarter to quarter but obviously we’re super proud of the 
result of both the adds in the quarter and just the future expansion opportunity that gives us. But 
remember, it’s still a drop in the bucket on the way to the Fortune 500,000 which is what we’re chasing.
George Iwanyc:
Okay. Trello looks like it’s continuing to see good adoption with new users. Can you give us a sense of 
how the cross-selling is going with that, or have you started to do that and the monetization opportunities?
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Sure, I can take that one down here in Sydney. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, we just passed 
the one-year mark of the closing of the acquisition of Trello. I can honestly say that no one on the team 
has been more excited than we are now about Trello. We continue to get more excited quarter on quarter 
about the potential and opportunities of Trello.
As we’ve said a number of times now, our focus to date has been just allowing it to continue its 
impressive momentum and user growth. The user base continues to grow quickly as Trello spreads 
around the world. 
With regards to the monetization, we certainly aren’t rushing in to cross-selling it to our existing base; 
we’re looking to do what makes the most sense for the businesses, but you can expect to see it continue 
to come closer and closer to the family as it continues to grow by itself.
We’ve previously mentioned that we expect Trello to contribute $20 million of the revenue in FY18. We 
expect to meet or exceed that at the moment, so we’re well on target. We haven’t been standing still with 
Trello, I suppose is the other important point to make. As we noticed last quarter, we introduced Trello 
into the Japanese market as well as partnerships with a whole series of local companies so we continue 
to use our strength with Atlassian to take Trello to places it couldn’t have got to by itself. As we

mentioned, we passed a million users now in four different countries individually, so in the U.S., Brazil, 
U.K. and France. 
I think Trello demonstrates our ability to successfully do acquisitions, to grow the product family, to 
maintain those acquisitions and their momentum, and then we’ll continue to do what we’ve done 
historically which is to bring the family closer together over time.
George Iwanyc:
All right, and last question for me on the tax rate. How should we look at that as we look forward to FY19?
James Beer:
In terms of the tax rate, I think Murray has probably described to you in the past how under IFRS our tax 
rate is calculated in each of the geographic entities in which we operate, and so based on the mix of 
income and the mix of deductions that are appropriate to take in each of those geographic entities, that 
can move the rate around from quarter to quarter moreso than you would see under the GAAP approach, 
and that was in fact how things played out in Q3. Q3 benefited; I would expect that to somewhat reverse 
out in Q4. I’m comfortable with what I’ve seen in terms of the overall tax rate for Fiscal Year ’18. We don’t 
guide yet for Fiscal ’19, so we’ll get back to you with that with more color around that story in a quarter or 
so’s time.
George Iwanyc:
All right, thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Gregg Moskowitz:
Thank you very much and apologies for the background noise. Jay, how did data center subscriptions do 
this quarter relative to your expectations?
Jay Simons:
Hey Gregg, I hope you’re on hands-free. It was great. It performed. We’re happy with the performance. It 
performed in line with what we expected. Continues to be a really important and large expansion 
opportunity for us into bigger enterprise organizations on the server side. I think nothing special really to 
highlight outside of there’s really good momentum in the data center business. It’s still an early product 
line with I think a lot of room for growth, and we’re pleased with how it performed.
Gregg Moskowitz:
Okay, thanks. Then James, you spoke about pull forwards into Q1 and Q2, and the company had noted 
that previously as well, but since this was the first quarter with the maintenance price increase in effect, 
just wondering if you saw any change with respect to the in-period maintenance renewal rates?
James Beer:

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
No, in terms of renewal rates, again, we’re very comfortable with the customer reaction to the price 
increase initiatives generally, and in Q3 obviously, yes, the new maintenance rates went into effect at the 
start of the quarter, but obviously others had in essence locked in that lower pricing. We’ll have those 
older prices in place for a number of quarters for a portion of our customer base.
Gregg Moskowitz:
Okay, thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Sanjit Singh:
Thank you for taking the question and welcome, James. It’s nice to have you onboard. Maybe I wanted to 
start off a little bit on some of the model dynamics. James, I’m wondering if you could remind us, as we 
move more to subscription, I think 80% of new product sales are now cloud, what impact does that have 
on the model, particularly when we are thinking about top line revenue growth?
James Beer:
As we continue to develop very, very strong momentum around cloud, but not only cloud as Jay was just 
mentioning the data center product as well, they’re both accounted for in the subscription line. We’re 
seeing very strong growth rate there.
The other side of that coin is you would expect that our server business that’s sold on a license and 
annual maintenance basis, it is not growing at that same pace. It’s growing nicely. You particularly see 
that in our statistics around license revenue. Those were in the single digit growth numbers this quarter. 
Just a very clear illustration when you contrast that growth rate to subscription how customers are moving 
increasingly to the cloud. 
In terms of the dynamic in terms of revenue recognition, then obviously subscription taken ratably over 
the period of the subscription length, whereas that server business has a component, the license 
component, that’s taken up front. As that license revenue component is growing at a significantly lesser 
rate than the subscription, then you’ll see the overall model trending towards in essence a more ratable, 
predictable type structure.
Sanjit Singh:
Got it, so that’s helpful. Then maybe in terms of Mike and Scott (inaudible), maybe a high level product 
question for you. In that project management space, particularly among business teams, whether it’s 
project management or task prioritization, there definitely seems to be just sort of a lot of options for 
users, and so what is the central value proposition that you guys are driving to, to get customers to use 
Atlassian versus what seems to be a ton of options out there in the market? Is it the integration back to 
Core Jira? What’s going to funnel that then onto the Atlassian platform?
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Good day, mate. I can take that. It’s a bit more of a philosophical question than we normally get on an 
earnings call. There’s been project management software for the last 25 years and I would expect there

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
will continue to be project management software for the next 25 years. Obviously with Trello and with Jira, 
specifically Jira Software, and even a little bit with Confluence, you could say that we manage projects in 
a lot of different ways for teams of knowledge workers depending on the types of projects that they are 
running. The more structured your project is, the more you have a larger number of people, very defined 
workflows, and structured content that you need, the more Jira Software and to some extent Jira Service 
Desk and Jira Core come to help your project succeed. That’s sort of … The biggest difference between 
Jira Software and Trello would be around the structuring and the control elements that you get. The larger 
a business gets the more structure and control it tends to need in the way that it runs its projects.
At the core though of both Jira Software and Trello would be the notion of workflow. It’s not as much 
about managing tasks as you would do as an individual in a task management application you might have 
on your phone which is more like to-do items: buy the milk, get the laundry, and you tick them off if they’re 
done or not done. Once you get into a team of people collaborating, you need to have great collaboration 
fundamentals, which Atlassian has baked into our DNA in terms of exchanging information, bringing 
people into the project, making sure the right people are aware of the right information. Then secondly, 
you need to have workflow capability to be able to move work around, to understand the core work items, 
the things that need to be done, who’s currently responsible for doing them, and then connect out as we 
do with all of our integrations and Marketplace add-ons to other applications where parts of the work may 
live. If you look at Jira Software, it connects to probably 50 or more different applications that might store 
a source code or builds or documents or whatever else there is. 
That’s sort of the way that we see project management. Fundamentally, it’s about workflow with the 
difference with Jira Software and Trello being around structured versus unstructured.
Sanjit Singh:
That’s super helpful. Maybe the last one for me, in terms of coming off a project vertigo (phon), which 
seems to be pretty successful, there used to be a sort of user cap on your cloud products. I think it was 
around 2,000 users. Now with that lid off, in essence, was there any sort of pent-up demand effect? I’m 
just trying to maybe contextualize the strong net new customer add performance which seemed to come 
from cloud. Was that sort of the removal of that user limit restriction, resulting in any sort of pent-up 
demand that caused that strong net new customer add performance this quarter?
Scott Farquhar:
Sanjit, it’s Scott here. We haven’t officially removed that 2,000 user limit. We are working with a select 
number of customers on that but it’s not something that we’ve lifted broadly, so I can’t answer that. There 
is demand from our large customers to move and there’s a lot of things that they want in that process, so I 
couldn’t answer that there’s a huge pent-up demand. We’ll see customers transition from server to cloud 
over a long period of time. 
As just a reminder, we’re pretty agnostic if people use our server-based products or our cloud-based 
products; we have a great server and data center business that serves from very small customers to very 
large customers behind the firewall. Our cloud business, also very small to very large customers in the 
cloud, so we’re really pretty agnostic about that.
Sanjit Singh:
Appreciate it. Thank you for the time, guys.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael Turits:
Hey, good evening everybody. James, welcome to Atlassian and the calls, and great to talk to you again 
after years. I haven’t talked to you since Symantec, so welcome.
James Beer:
Yeah. Thank you, Michael.
Michael Turits:
One question for you on margins. Margins and EPS guide was just slightly below for next quarter. This 
was a really great year for margin expansion, so any thoughts on why they might have been a little bit 
below the street and at least philosophically, any thoughts on margin expansion in the next year with the 
Street looking for just above 1 point of growth or expansion.
James Beer:
In terms of the current year, I’d say a couple of things. We did identify some additional opportunities to 
spend against our various product investment areas. Second thing I’d mention is that we’re particularly 
pleased with the pace with which we’re attracting top talent to both our Bengaluru office across multiple 
functions and the Mountainview office as well. I’m excited about that.
In terms of the longer term, as we think about margins, obviously last year I think at the Investor Day, the 
Company committed to continuing to have modest increases in both operating and free cash flow margins 
over time, and we’re very fortunate to have such strong market opportunities in front of us, excellent R&D 
capabilities. So, we will have more opportunities to invest in ways that will drive very strong returns to our 
shareholders, and what we’ll do is back that up with a robust process of driving accountability within 
Atlassian for spending wisely, and I think that will be a good outcome for shareholders.
Michael Turits:
Got it, thanks. I think for Jay, can you give us an update really on how things are going with the channel? 
Any changes there? Whatever particular partners you want to talk about but including some of resellers 
that seem to be expanding, and how they are working with some of the personnel inside including 
technical and account managers to drive some of the larger deals.
Jay Simons:
Hey, Michael. No material changes. The channel, as you know, has been an important part of the model, 
an important part of Atlassian for the better of the past decade; it continues to be so both in terms of 
reaching new markets geographically, new markets that we’re targeting like as an example with Jira 
Service Desk and sort of the IT landscape, as well as just reaching new customers and then expanding 
existing ones. They do overindex around larger enterprises, in part because of the complexity, the 
expansion, the opportunity for the services and engagement that they offer is larger.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
I had the opportunity to meet a number of them during the Team Tour event that we highlighted, and 
everyone I spoke with shared positive signals about both the current business and the opportunities that 
they see in front of them. So, I would just say all things humming.
Michael Turits:
Great. Thanks very much.
Operator:
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
Keith Bachman:
Hi. Many thanks. I also wanted to ask two questions. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of sense 
about the puts and takes involved in the June quarter guidance. To a previous comment you said you felt 
like the pricing increases had manifested themselves in the December and March quarters. If I look at the 
guidance for June though, you’re guiding to even at the top end 5% sequential growth. In the last two 
years, June ’16 and June ’17, you grew 8% and 9% sequentially, and so I was just hoping you could go 
through what are some of the puts and takes we should consider as we’re running through our models 
related to the June quarter? Thank you. And I have a follow-up.
James Beer:
As you think about the June quarter, I think it’s important to recall that we’ve now lapped Trello year-overyear, so that effect will be a factor.
Keith Bachman:
Yeah, sorry. My comments were sequential so Trello wouldn’t really impact that.
James Beer:
In terms of the sequential process, I think again you’ll see there, similar to one of the answers I gave a 
little earlier, as you got cloud and data center continuing to grow very, very fast, the license revenue line 
obviously growing at a much, much lower rate than that, you’ll see the revenue model orientation lift 
become more ratable. The deferred revenue component, in essence, rises somewhat relative to the 
recognized revenue component, so underlying this we continue to have strong demand across the 
product set and I’m very comfortable with the fundamentals of the top line.
Keith Bachman:
Okay. Thank you. My follow-up question then does relate to pricing. You’ve had a few sets of price 
increases, depending on the category, subscription maintenance, license, etc., and at the Analyst Day 
last year you talked about you envision annual price increases. I just wanted to see if that’s still the way 
we should be thinking about the Atlassian model. As we look out of the next year, is it that price increases 
will be an annual event?

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
Yeah, well one of the things with my sort of outsider lens on, if you will, that you’ve been really struck by 
us the remarkable ratio in terms of price to value that Atlassian offers right across its product set. That 
obviously underpins what’s been said in the last year or so about a philosophy of being able to apply 
annual price increases on the server and cloud side of our businesses, and of course we’ll always be very 
thoughtful about current market conditions and so forth, but I think that is a part of the model that you 
should expect to see going forward.
Keith Bachman:
Okay. Many thanks. Congratulations.
Operator:
The next question comes from Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
Adam Holt:
Hi everyone. I’ll also echo the congratulations and welcome for James. James, it’s also been a long time 
and glad to have you back.
James Beer:
Thanks, Adam.
Adam Holt:
Absolutely. I had two questions. In the shareholder letter you had some nice language and some 
numbers around Confluence which I don’t think I’d seen for a while, but a lot of detail around how you’re 
expanding outside of the IT, sort of the core IT organization. I was hoping maybe you could touch on in 
general how the efforts have been to extend outside of IT and really monetize that non-IT opportunity. 
Then I had a follow-up for James.
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Good day, mate. I can talk to that one. Confluence has continued to be one of the great success stories 
of Atlassian over the last decade, and passing 40,000 customers individually, obviously it continues to be 
our second biggest product and growing strongly and so it was a good moment to celebrate all the 
achievements of Confluence in the cloud server and data center realms.
It is certainly one of the products that pushes the furthest and the fastest outside of technology teams, 
and it’s continued to do so in terms of Marketing, Finance, Sales, all of the other functions inside of a 
company. It continues to be our long-term trend as a business as we highlight in data, in customer 
examples, and as you see in some of the Confluence parts of the shareholder letter, we continue to land 
strongly in Software and IT departments in companies, and continue to grow across the Enterprise into all 
teams. Then alongside that continuing to land also a little bit more broadly. If you think of something like 
Trello, it lands sort of all over the map, even going as far as home teams and different forms of crosscompany collaboration, and we continue to see that as an important part of our model is the strength to 
be able to land in certain types of teams and then having a product depth and breadth to be able to 
expand across an organization to all types of teams.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
Thank you. Then for James, the perpetual number, the license number in the quarter was a little shy of 
consensus and I wanted to know did you all hit your number internally in the quarter? How should we 
think about the quarter-over-quarter in license so we as an analyst community make sure that we get that 
right going into the next quarter so we’re more in line with your thinking? Thanks.
James Beer:
On the perpetual license line, also just going back to one of my earlier answers, as we think about the pull 
forward effect that we saw of activity into the first half of the year as customers looked to get ahead of 
price increases, certainly the primary effect there would have been around customers renewing 
maintenance contracts and so forth, but there was also a certain element of customers bringing forward 
new purchases, upgrades to current installations and so forth, and obviously that would have helped the 
perpetual license line—excuse me, the license revenue line in the first half of the year, and so that 
dragged some of that activity out of Q3 and to some effect we’ll see that in Q4 as well, although I would 
expect that effect to dampen out as time goes by.
Adam Holt:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Zach Lountzis:
Hi guys. Zach Lountzis for John. Jay, there was some helpful comments you gave on the data center 
trends earlier, but within there are there any updates on how Atlassian Stack is doing? I remember a few 
quarters ago you said over 50% of customers with 500 or more users have three or more products, which 
I guess helped drive the creation of this discounted suite. What are your thoughts on offering something 
similar for cloud specifically? Thanks.
Jay Simons:
Hey Zach, you shouldn’t consider Stack to be a material driver of data center growth. I mean it’s really 
offered as a simpler packaging of multiple products at a nominal discount for a company that’s going to 
basically swallow the blue pill and take all of them all at once. It’s going to be rare but it’s there for 
customers to remove friction if they want to do that, to basically do it easier. 
I think the more common pattern is a customer is going to adopt Jira Data Center when they’re ready to 
do it, Confluence Data Center when they’re ready to do it, Jira Service Desk Data Center when they’re 
ready to do it, and those might be at different times. It’s there. It removes friction for them when they want 
to do it, but I’d focus sort of overall on the growth of the data center business on whole, which is good.
Zach Lountzis:
Okay, sure. Good. Thank you.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, April 19, 2018
Again, if you have a question, please press star, then one. The next question comes from Pat Walravens 
with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Walravens:
Great. Thank you for taking the question. I appreciate it. James, welcome and forgive me for beating a 
dead horse here, and if it’s just too much then say, but should we expect the perpetual license rate to 
decelerate from Q3 into Q4?
James Beer:
Well, we don’t get that granular in terms of the guidance thought process, but I think the core trend here is 
that more and more of our customers are choosing cloud as the way in which they want to consume our 
product, and I would expect that that will continue. When you add to that the fact that many of our larger 
customers on the server side of our business are choosing to deploy our data center product, and both 
data center and cloud are a part of the subscription revenue line, then I think it’s reasonable to infer that 
there’s going to be a lesser proportion as time goes by going through the license revenue line. That said 
though, that’s still a very important and robust part of our business.
Patrick Walravens:
That’s very helpful. Thank you. Then Scott, in your picture I just noticed in the letter you talk about how 
you’re transitioning from the Chair of the Board role. I was super impressed by the academic background 
of your successor, but I was just wondering why you feel like this is the time for that.
Scott Farquhar:
Yes. Pat, we’ve always surrounded ourselves, Mike and I have always surrounded ourselves with the 
best people we can in order to grow this business, whether that is the Board, and I think we have a very 
impressive Board for all of our Board members, all the Management Team we have. We can’t do this
alone and we really want the best people in the world to help us along that. Having Shona as the Chair 
will free up my time to be more detailed and involved in the business, and also provide the opportunity for 
Mike and I to sort of enhance our learning from her and for her to have a better opportunity to help out the 
business. 
I’m very excited by that. Mike and I have never sort of coveted the Chair position from any sort of ego 
perspective or anything like that. It’s really about just getting the right people around us to make a 
successful company.
Patrick Walravens:
Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator:
This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the 
Management Team for any closing remarks.

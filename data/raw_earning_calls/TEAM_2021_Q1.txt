MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Atlassian's earnings conference call for the first quarter of 
fiscal 2021. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor 
Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Matthew Sonefeldt
Vice President-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Good afternoon and welcome to our Q1 of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call 
today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; and Chief 
Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our first quarter of fiscal 2021. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. On 
our IR site, we have also posted a supplemental data sheet. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and 
then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially 
different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking 
statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such 
statements are made, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be 
up-to-date. Further information on these and other factors that could affect company's financial results is included 
in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled 
Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures 
are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures 
versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used 
by other companies.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our 
shareholder letter, and in our updated investor sheet on the IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full question 
upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Also, please be patient if we encounter any 
disruptions or challenges.
Lastly, we've announced two additional items in conjunction with our financial results this quarter. First, we have 
filed the Form 6-K announcing the successful close of $1 billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan and a 
$500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Second, we've announced that we will host a fiscal 2021 
virtual Investor Day on Tuesday, November 17, at 2:00 PM Pacific Time. You'll be able to RSVP for that over the 
next 24 hours through our IR website. We hope to see you there.

Thank you, everyone, for joining today and for your continued support. We hope you and your loved ones are 
healthy during what continues to be a dynamic time for everyone, including our customers, partners, and 
employees. We hope you've taken the time to read the shareholder letter. This quarter, we've been transparent in 
describing the many different long-term initiatives that we're focused on as a company. This includes our recent 
announcement focused on migrating our customers from Server products to the cloud.
In Q1, we posted strong results, adding over 8,600 net new customers, generated $460 million in revenue, up 
26% year-over-year, and realizing solid non-IFRS profitability of $61 million in free cash flow. [ph] We've got 
(00:03:46) several product wins as well, including achieving FedRAMP certification for Trello Enterprise, 
strengthening our partnership with Slack, launching Atlassian Ventures, and closing the Mindville acquisition, 
which accelerates our ability to offer customers a comprehensive ITSM experience.
Looking forward to the rest of fiscal 2021, we will continue to focus on playing offense for the long term. [ph] Full 
of our (00:04:13) choices and actions focused on making our customers successful can drive us through $5 billion 
and beyond.
Before we move to Q&A, Scott and I both want to thank our employees that continue to be an inspiration for us in 
these challenging times. Thank you for sharing your passion with our customers, especially as they move to the 
cloud. You make unleashing the potential of all teams possible.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. 
Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Turrin
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q
Hey there. Thanks and good afternoon. On the cloud migration, I'm sure there will be a number of questions on it. 
Obviously super early and appreciate there's an Investor Day upcoming, which we're certainly all looking forward 
to. But any initial feedback you've gathered from customers and partners early on to share? And I think it's 
unquestionably the right strategic decision, but in terms of the risks to be aware of, how do you think about the 
potential friction a hard and fast timeline can add to the equation? And you mentioned some of this in the letter as 
well, but can you talk through some of the steps you're taking to help ensure this transition is as frictionless as 
possible? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure, Michael. [ph] I can quickly address that (00:05:52). This is Mike. Hi there, can you hear me? This is Mike.

Operator: We could hear you now, Mike.

[indiscernible] (00:06:17). Thank you. Sorry, apologies for that. As I was saying beforehand, [indiscernible] 
(00:06:24) because I was on mute, the customer's feedback has been largely as we expected. So we've had the 
expected range of responses. I would say, our customer base has been [ph] ultimate at coming to ask these 
(00:06:37) questions. We've given a long timeframe here, so there's multiple years. So when you sit down with 
the customers and explain [ph] how you've gotten years here (00:06:46) to make a decision, this is a three-year 
end-of-life timeframe, and there are a lot of options for you.
Our teams have done an amazing job with content to help our customers through that journey. So we've got, I 
think, 10 or 12 different language translation. There's 1 million-plus words of content out there, which I'm told is 
longer than the entire Harry Potter series. So this has really been an all company effort to make sure that this is 
handled well with the customer [ph] first wins and try (00:07:13) to be as clear [ph] and entertaining (00:07:15) to 
customers as possible as we move through that.
Obviously, as we discussed in Q4, we think we're ready to make this transition. It's been a long-term journey. 
We've been working on for a long time. And this is just the next step on that journey particularly. We've had more 
than a decade-long history now of building cloud products and a multiyear investment in our cloud platform. And 
we really believe, as we show for more than 95% of new customers choosing today, we're at the right particular 
time to move our customers across. But necessarily, this is an announcement that for some customers [ph] is a

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Really nice quarter, this quarter, in terms of the new customer 
adds. I don't think we've seen a number that strong in quite some time. Two questions, well, one question on that. 
In the letter, it sounds like you guys don't expect that level of customer gains to maintain on a go-forward basis. 
Could you talk about why not, like sort of what is going to bring those back down on a go-forward basis? And then 
maybe one for James, on the guidance for the full year and the slowing down, it seems to assume that like the 
subscription line is going to have to slow down for the remainder of the year. I get what's going on with license, I 
get what's going on with maintenance and the marketplace. I don't quite get kind of what the pressures are on 
subscriptions. Can you dig into that a little bit for us and sort of why the shift towards cloud doesn't have a more 
immediate positive impact, at least on the subscription line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, Keith, I can take both of those. So, first of all, on the customer adds, yes, we were very pleased with that 
figure. A couple of things, though, that I think probably did help it somewhat in this quarter. First of all, you'll recall 
that in Q4, we had a relatively low customer add number. And what we talked about there was COVID-related 
churn effects impacting some of our cloud customers in particular. And I think part of what we've seen here is in 
essence, a little bit of a pull-forward of that churn from Q1 into Q4, as those customers were experiencing 
obviously very tough macroeconomic-type conditions. And so I think some of those who perhaps might have 
churned in Q1 under normal circumstances ended up churning earlier in Q4.
The other thing I'd point to is that we obviously, as you know, have really established free versions of Jira 
Software, Confluence and Jira Service Desk in the market now. And as a result of doing that, we've curtailed our 
cloud starter offering. And so for those folks, we've seen a nice portion of them moving up to a full standard cloud 
license, and therefore being counted in our definition of a customer. So, both of those things, I wouldn't expect 
those to be recurring necessarily in the coming quarters, but certainly, yeah, we're very pleased with that 
customer number. That's a nice illustration of the power of our land and expand model.
To the revenue picture, a few thoughts on this one. During this next phase of the cloud transition, we've really 
given our 30,000 or so Server customers the control to pick their migration path and the timing of that move. And 
so, this will introduce a degree of variability into our financial model likely over the coming handful or so of 
quarters. And so given this variability, we wanted to provide everyone with something of a framework as you 
consider our revenue growth during this transitional period. And I think of that framework as having five themes to 
it that we've really generally discussed with you previously.
First of all, consider COVID-19 and the resulting challenging macroeconomic environment that's created for our 
customers. Q1 in this regard was quite encouraging versus Q4 of the last fiscal years in terms of the figures. And

Copyright © 2001-2020 FactSet CallStreet, LLC
based on what we've seen in Q2 in those numbers, so far, we continue to be encouraged. And so we're assuming 
that this headwind diminishes steadily but will still be a factor in our revenue results, including the subscription line 
in particular, because we've seen obviously our smaller customers generally use our cloud products. We would 
see that being still a factor over the next tenfold of quarters or so. But that said, as you know, we are seeing 
COVID-19 cases continue to grow around [ph] Central (00:13:00) Europe and the Americas. So we're remaining 
watchful of any building impacts on our financials from impacted industries or some of our small, medium-sized 
business customers.
The second point, as we've discussed before, are we've very much taken the stance of investing through this 
challenging macroeconomic period for our customers, with very much the strong belief that that will drive longterm competitive advantage for us, and a good example of that investment focus, which is really a consistent 
theme right across these next four drivers that I'll mention, was the broad rollout of those free versions of Jira 
Software, Confluence, and Jira Service Desk. We've been very pleased with the resulting expansion at the top of 
the marketing funnel, and that's going to create an excellent source of new customers for us over the long term, 
but in the short term, this will create a revenue headwind that we expect will moderate in the next year or so.
Third, we've also talked about another investment that we've been making in this macroeconomic environment, 
and that is to drive less FY 2021 revenue growth from price increases than was the case in fiscal 2020. Now, the 
Server and Data Center price changes that we announced just recently will largely benefit FY 2022 and beyond, 
so we expect the FY 2021 pricing-related growth headwind to neutralize in the coming quarters.
Fourth, as we discussed 90 days ago, we expect our Server business will decline, especially now given the end of 
life announcement, and specifically the FY 2021 license revenue line, we expect to be down around 50%, 5-0%, 
year-over-year, and the maintenance revenue line will be approximately flat year-over-year in FY 2021, as our 
Server customers gradually migrate. And we expect a similar effect on our Server apps business, which we 
account for in the other revenue line. Based on our recent announcement, we would expect license revenue to 
trend down towards zero in the next 1.5 years or so, and the significantly larger maintenance revenue line to do 
the same over approximately the next 3.5 years.
And then the fifth point is that while we're excited by the long-term benefits of the cloud for both our customers 
and Atlassian, we're again taking a very customer-focused approach to gradually phasing in these benefits to our 
financials. So for example, the larger customers will offer material discounts to our [ph] cloudless (00:16:00) 
prices for a multiyear period, depending on the timing of the customers' move to the cloud. And this approach will 
bring gradually growing revenue benefits. Those discount levels subside over the coming three or so years. And 
then for smaller customers making that transition, we've really designed the server and cloud economics to be 
somewhat similar. So as these customers grow in the cloud, they'll of course enjoy more of the benefits of our 
cloud offerings, and we'll share in that additional value creation.
So, the net of all of that – I realized that's quite a mouthful – the net of all of that, I would say, is that revenue 
generation will be driven in part by the timing of customers electing to migrate. I would expect beneficial migration 
revenue effects to gradually build over time, especially as our larger customers increasingly migrate to the cloud 
in the coming years. And my current expectation is that our revenue growth rate would begin improving beyond 
the next year or so. So, that's probably a little more color than you were expecting, Keith. But I wanted to really...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, I think there will be some pull-forward activity as in previous years. We're giving customers time to think 
about how to step in front of those price increases that come into effect on this coming February 2. So, yes, in our 
modeling, we do try to predict some amount of that pull-forward, but that's always a challenging exercise. And I'd 
say it's more difficult this year, because this time, we've actually announced the end of life of Server, so how 
customers will adjust in their pull-forward activity to that really remains to be seen over the next several weeks.

Walter H. Pritchard
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Hi. Thanks. Just to build on the last one, we talked a lot about Server, and that's pretty clear with the end of life 
and so forth. Around Data Center, how are you expecting that the news that you've put out around Server will 
impact the larger customers who are on Data Center, who may look at this move and say, Data Center [ph] is 
next in that (00:18:55) and that's just the path that Atlassian's going where the innovation is and so forth in cloud? 
Do you expect, even though it's not a direct announcement there, that you'll have to sort of induced a behavior 
change there as well?

Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Scott here. I'll take that. Yeah, look, I mean, what we've said for our customers is – [ph] in front of our 
(00:19:17) largest customers are choosing to remain on Data Center, because they have a longer timeframe that 
they want to migrate and [ph] were continuing (00:19:28) to invest in our Data Center product. Just a reminder for 
some of those who haven't read all the announcements, [ph] we're end of life at (00:19:36) Server product, but 
our Data Center product continues to be something Atlassian builds upon and supports and continues to invest in. 
Now that said, I have talked to [ph] a whole number of CIOs (00:19:46) over the last three months from –
everything from regulated industries, banks, European customers, and every single one of those [ph] CIOs 
(00:19:55) have a plan to move to our cloud, whether they're in a regulated industry or a European customer, and 
it's just a matter of when. So our Data Center product is going to be critical in making sure those customers are 
supported over their timeframe for migration, but we expect that all our customers will migrate to cloud over the 
medium term.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. James, I wanted to circle back, I guess, on fiscal 2022, 
because clearly there are some puts and takes and you alluded to some of them. But I guess as I think about it on 
one hand, there will be an additional loss of perpetual license revenue. There will be significant ongoing migration 
incentives. But on the other hand, you're going to get more benefit from the upcoming price increases, more 
conversion from free to paid, and the loyalty discounts in year two for large customers naturally won't be as 
significant. Now, in the shareholder letter you said that fiscal 2022 will also be negatively impacted by all of the 
changes that you've recently made. But just to be clear on this point, any revenue headwinds will be greater in 
fiscal 2021 than fiscal 2022, correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, what I was [ph] chiming (00:21:18) about there, Gregg, as I kind of walked through that five-point framework 
with the different timeframes that I feel will be relevant to each of those factors. As you framed there in the 
question, you've got a lot of moving parts. I'd say the net of all of this is that the revenue growth rate would begin 
improving again beyond the next year or so. So in the letter, we used similar words in my section, but that's how I 
think you should consider the trajectory of the revenue growth rate pattern.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, James. And then just a quick follow-up, there was a comment that the current 
expectation is that there will be lower take rates on the sales of cloud apps through the Atlassian Marketplace, I 
suppose, over the rest of the year for the near term anyway. I'm just kind of wondering why that would be the 
case.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. There, we're just very much looking to continue to provide rich incentives for our app ecosystem partners to 
build more cloud apps and have them be in our Marketplace. Obviously, that Marketplace started out life many

years ago as a Server-based marketplace. More recently within the last year and a half or so, we've really 
focused on expanding the Data Center apps as well. And with this very clear focus we have as a company now 
on the cloud transition, obviously we want to make sure that our customers can gain access to the same sort of 
functionality that they really benefit from in their current apps behind the firewall available in the cloud as well. So 
we just want to make sure that the financial incentives for our app developers line up with that. And as we 
mentioned in the letter, we've designed those as temporary incentives.

Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to round back to the blog post that you'd put out a couple weeks ago 
about the changing in the server pricing. But you also have a comment on the blog post around future cloud 
pricing. I know today in the shareholder letter [audio gap] (00:23:50-00:23:54) blog post which seems to imply that 
the customers in the advantaged pricing program might eventually be moved up the list price. So maybe just help 
me navigate that and what that could mean for a potential cloud price increase for those cloud customers.

But in terms of what we've talked about in that blog post a couple of weeks ago, yes, we are raising prices 
effective February 2 for our Server and Data Center products. And we note in the shareholder letter that while, 
yes, you've got to be very thoughtful about user tiers and product combinations for specific price outcomes if 
you're a customer, directionally, from a modeling perspective, they equate to about 15% increases year-overyear. We're very explicitly not raising cloud prices this year versus the case where we have done that, in whole or 
in part, in previous years. And in terms of your reference to advantaged pricing, yes, there were some price lists 
for current customers, when we've rolled some of these price increases through, we've always wanted to be 
thoughtful about the degree of change that the customer is taking on in terms of price. And so in each of the 
situations, the end result is [ph] list price (00:25:46). But it just takes longer than just an immediate step function

up to the new list price, just reflective of people – customers' current budgets and those sorts of things. So does 
that get at what you are asking?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah. It does. So just to be clear, the advantaged pricing plan is probably for a very small sub-segment of your 
cloud customers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yes. So the advantaged cloud customers were those, you may recall a year ago, for the higher user tier part of 
our cloud pricing structure. So certainly a year ago, we had relatively few customers in that part of our customer 
base, and yes, we move prices up for those higher cloud tiers. So for those customers who had gone early to the 
larger scale end of the cloud, we're giving them more time to come up to list. Yes, that's a relatively small 
proportion of the overall cloud user base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Thank you, Alex. [indiscernible] (00:26:59) Scott Farquhar here, just to chime in and add to James, like, it's 
a great question [ph] on the details (00:27:04), but philosophically, we want to get our customers to the cloud. 
When I talk to companies big and small, they want to move across to the cloud. We know that over time, because 
we solve a lot more problems for them and take a lot of the management overhead from them, the scalability 
issue, the hardware costs, because we do all that on their behalf, they're willing to pay larger – higher prices in 
order for us [ph] to get order (00:27:30). The cost savings are significant. In many cases, [indiscernible] (00:27:34) 
five or six people managing our products, [ph] when you were managing yourself (00:27:39) that's down, we have 
a case study with us down to under a person now. And so, those cost savings, we can capture some of that.
The aim is in the short term though to make it an absolutely easy decision for people to move across 
[indiscernible] (00:27:53) discussions in their organization [indiscernible] (00:27:57) make the cost and price 
relatively the same in the sort of first year of transfer, and over time step them back up and capture sort of more of 
the value that we're providing for them.
So really, there's a lot of ways [ph] you could do it slight (00:28:11) differently. And we think this one is very 
customer-friendly, and we've always thought about the long-term customer relationships we have, from 
[indiscernible] (00:28:20) all the way up to [ph] CIOs (00:28:21) of very large organizations, we want to have very 
great relationships as we provide more and more products for them, and we sell them more things, but also that 
[indiscernible] (00:28:33) without any sort of [indiscernible] (00:28:36). So, that's sort of the [indiscernible] 
(00:28:38).

Ittai Kidron
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thanks and good quarter, guys. Leaving the cloud on the side for a second, Scott, Mike, maybe you can talk 
about Trello in the work management space. Maybe you could talk about progress over there, and maybe finetune the kind of differentiation over there now that the [indiscernible] (00:29:10) how do you see the landscape? 
How do you see your competitive positioning there and opportunities ahead? And then for James, just kind of 
following up on the Data Center side of the equation, correct me if I'm wrong, that is a [ph] term (00:29:23) 
business, so that shows up in subscription revenue. But can you tell us the magnitude? How much of your 
subscription revenue is tied to on-premise, not to cloud, perhaps number of customers? I think you talked about 
30,000 enterprise customers. What would be the count on the Data Center side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure, Ittai. This is Mike. Hope you're doing well. Look, on the work management side, I can give you some color. 
It wasn't a specific question, I suppose. Obviously, look, you saw us in the quarter on specifics, we got support for 
Trello in FedRAMP. For obvious reasons, Trello is doing well in the government sector and continues to grow 
there. I'd say the broader story there is around Trello [ph] in the enterprise (00:30:11), and as the extremely large 
Trello user base continues to grow apace, how that is, it's starting to get into larger organizations like the 
government, obviously, indicated from that. At the same time, Trello continues to sort of broaden the appeal of its 
product. So, you've seen us do a lot of work with what we call Trello [ph] views (00:30:35), so changing the way 
that you see the data that's inside Trello, and also embedding Trello into a lot of other places.
In a broader sense, I would say, look, that area of work management for all continues to be one that we are 
spending a lot of time in. Confluence continues to grow very well. You've seen us with the Halp acquisition in 
terms of providing a sort of service management experience inside of Slack and inside of messaging tools which 
is used by IT, certainly, but used increasingly by other teams where that's a much more familiar enterprise for 
them to provide a service management capability. So, I think we're incredibly positive about all of the things we 
have going on in that area. Continued innovation and continued enterprise growth of work management for all 
tools, I think, bodes very well for us in that space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, 
Atlassian Corp. Plc
A
And Ittai, this is James. I can jump in on the second part of your question. So, yes, Data Center is accounted for 
in the subscription revenue line. And I think the way to really think about that subscription in Q1 represented 60% 
of total revenue. And recall that in the past we've said that the cloud business is just a little shy of 50% of total 
revenue at this point. So, that gives you directionally a sense for the scale of the Data Center business.
And in terms of customer accounts, some of the other data points we've offered, and now we have 182,000-plus 
total customers, and we've talked about 160,000 cloud customers. So, again that gives you a little bit of a sense 
directionally of the overall customer count.

Hey, guys. This is Luv Sodha, on for Brent Thill. Nice quarter and great investments on cloud side. I wanted to 
ask a couple questions. One was, in terms of – you provide great color on server to cloud pricing. I was 
wondering like, what would be the – in terms of any color you could provide on Server to Data Center pricing, in 
terms of what's the difference and what the migration process entails there? And then the second question was 
around the Mindville acquisition that you closed this quarter. Obviously, how does that position you relative to the 
competitors in that marketplace in the ITSM space? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, I can perhaps take the first part of the question in terms of the economics of moving from Server to Data 
Center. Really quite similar to the situation when a customer is electing to move over to the cloud. For our larger 
customers in the thousand-plus seats category, we would again look to offer material discount levels, less than 
those that we would be offering someone moving over to the cloud but still material discount levels over a multiyear period. So, it's a similar approach reflecting the comments that Scott and Mike made earlier that the Data 
Center is very much still a deployment option that we continue to invest in for the future.
So, I'll pass over to Michael, Scott for the Mindville part. Mike?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks, Luv. Thanks, James. Thanks, Luv, for the question. I can certainly take that. Look, we continue to be 
incredibly excited about what's going on in the ITSM space as we continue our long-term journey in that space. It 
really has been a series of years now. I think if you zoom out, you can look at that and see a whole kaleidoscope 
of options. There are many, many ways that companies can provide ITSM solutions. I do think what we're doing is 
bringing that into pretty sharp focus. And if you look at our offerings continuing to mature in the way we've taken 
Jira Service Desk and then adding Statuspage for external communication, adding Opsgenie to provide rostering 
and real-time management capabilities of your team and bringing them into incidents, and then obviously adding 
Mindville for CMDB capabilities, so asset management of all types alongside our service management capabilities 
that we've released, so not only managing the services that are outbound but also providing a registry of the 
inside services, the technology services that you have inside your company.
What we're starting to do is really provide a single pane of glass that can look across your IT operations and 
development teams. As teams and companies are increasingly bringing their development teams closer to their IT 
teams, we're providing a singular set of offerings that run across that. And as we continue to integrate them and 
add the Atlassian platform under all of them, we're obviously incredibly excited about both the growth of the space 
but also the uniqueness and the clarity that our offering brings to the – to otherwise quite blurry space that is 
around that and the uniqueness of that offering. So, really excited about that space going forward, and you'll 
continue to see us investing there and continue to see us having big announcements in that space.

Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Scott here. Thanks for the question, Jack. Look, the systems integrators or what we call our partners' partners 
have been a huge part of Atlassian's success. We have a great partner network. Hundreds of partners around the 
world, particularly in Europe is a real big strength for us. And they're – as we see with some of our larger 
engagements with customers on the larger side, like most of them are bringing in and working with the systems 
integrator on those transformations. And [ph] you see, (00:37:34) particularly as you think about digital 
transformation, a lot of what needs to get done in those organizations is not simply the deployment of software. 
It's actually changing the way that these organizations work to do agile transformation or scaled agile framework 
and so forth. And so, these systems integrators are really important to be on the ground to help out with some of 
these transformations that have to happen.
And so, we've been particularly happy with those systems integrators. And you would also say our migrations, 
people migrating to the cloud, is a huge opportunity for our systems integrators, and we've seen some of our best 
partners build migrations practices already in moving people to the cloud, and that's been a great source of 
business for them and also a great way for our customers to get across to the cloud faster.
And of course, we continue our depth of portfolio that we provide to CIOs in terms of everything from the Jira 
framework and Confluence, but all the way up to Jira Align, which handles effectively the CEO dashboard about 
how their organization is going in the digital transformation. Again, that makes us more strategic for customers. 
And many of our customers, they walk to our partners to help them deploy and roll it out.

Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Just two quick ones. First, if we do kind of the back-of-theenvelope math, you've got roughly 60%-ish of your customer base that's using a hybrid, some products onpremise, some products in the cloud. Can you give us a little bit more color on what these sort of situations look 
like? Is it a function of they might be using Jira on-premise and Trello in the cloud or is it a departmental level 
thing where the initial adopters are using Jira Server/Data Center and new teams are jumping straight to Jira 
Cloud?
And then the second is just on thinking through the longer-term COVID impact over the past couple quarters, 
you've identified some of the headwinds from SMB exposure and payment duration. When we look out maybe 
longer-term, especially given that it's looking likely that we're going to be in a much more distributed workforce 
even post pandemic, how do you think that shapes maybe the necessity for your solutions and the demand 
environment? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
It's great questions. Firstly, I'm not sure the back of the envelope is 60% of customers is necessarily right, but we 
said in the past that 95% of our new customers use our cloud offerings, and while we don't disclose the overlaps 
like – but I can talk through the reasons for that. If you – one of the advantages of the cloud is that you can get 
going really quickly. You don't need to deploy hardware. You don't need to kind of even find space in your Data 
Center. And so, what we find is even amongst our largest customers that may have deployed wall-to-wall with our

Data Center or Server offerings with new projects what they want to get off the ground quickly, they, in many 
cases, will deploy a cloud version of our product.
So, we find that even [indiscernible] (00:40:57) customers you find using [indiscernible] (00:40:59) cloud products, 
and in many cases that's sort of the White House department inside those companies as they move to migrate to 
cloud. So, I think it really speaks to the ease and speed of which customers can get going in that cloud, but you 
see that hybrid and, of course, over time we'll see those cloud things scale.
On the distributed workforce side of things, what we saw in initial days of COVID was a spike in our web traffic. I 
think they're in the order of roughly 10%, where we saw noticeably a huge spike in customers within days of the 
pandemic. But because our existing customers were using our products with a high frequency and [indiscernible] 
(00:41:36) posted notes in the whiteboards and then they want to track all the work they did inside our tools, and 
there's a huge opportunity for that because once you track work in products like Jira, Trello, Confluence or any of 
our products, there's opportunities for automation, which we've seen with all our investments in automation and 
Atlassian's automation products. There's investments [ph] to smarts (00:42:02) and we've seen some 
announcements recently around how we're using data machine learning to better route work through the right 
people. And so, we think there's a huge opportunity for our products to help with the workforce.
And the other thing which was surprising for me when I chatted with CIOs is that the CIO's agenda has never 
been more aligned with the CEO's agenda. If you went back to sort of 15 years of CEO and the CIO's agenda 
would be sort of marginally overlapping, whereas today the same problems CEOs are struggling with, which is, 
how do I make my workforce productive while we're remote, how do I serve our customers in a new way 
particularly if I have to move our transactions with our customers online, how do I make sure my employees are 
healthy, how do I make sure the workflows across the organization are moving fast? Like, these are all CEO 
conversations and board level conversations that are happening, and the CIO is now on the hook for doing that.
And now the – it used to be that HR was responsible for the water cooler; now, CIOs are responsible for the 
digital water cooler. And so, what has surprised me is how much interest there's been around culture in – from 
CIOs. So, traditionally, he wouldn't be thinking that that would be fund of mine for them. And because of Atlassian 
and the way we work and how we work openly and how our products promote and open a transparent culture, 
they've seen us as a trusted partner to help them transform their organizations.

Great. This is actually Nick Altmann, on for Derrick. Thanks for taking our questions. You guys have talked about

of the portfolio versus net new offerings?

few times, we're in three very large markets between work management for all the software agile DevOps market,

and then into obviously the IT and the ITSM market. One of our advantages is not only of these three fantastic 
markets that are incredibly critical to customers and to companies that Scott mentioned. They are all connected at
various different points. One of the strengths Atlassian has is having products, Confluence runs across all three, 
Jira as a platform runs across all three. Trello is increasingly used in lots of different places across all three. So, 
having products and connections between these markets, as we've mentioned software coming closer to IT, 
obviously the IT department being more involved in all sorts of what management capabilities. These 
connectivities are a huge strategic strength of ours, but require R&D investment. They require us to continue to 
bring products closer together to allow customers to reuse data across different spaces and building out our cloud 
infrastructure to handle all of the enterprise needs of customers, as well as the work management and the 
automation data platforms, as Scott has mentioned.
So, yes, we will certainly continue to invest in R&D across a lot of those areas. Our platform is a continued place 
of some significant investment, both to bring our marketplace up to speed but also, as I mentioned, to look across 
the increasing amounts of data we have and providing better answers, automation, AI. There's lots of things that 
we're doing and building there.
We are always looking at building new products. We always have a series of different prototypes and things, 
working on things internally. Sometimes those become products for the outside world. Sometimes they actually 
get merged into existing applications and become features of what we're already doing. So, one of the 
advantages of our business model, obviously, is our ability to invest in R&D and continue to keep that innovation 
going. One of the advantages of our DNA is the long-term thinking, and when you put both together, I think that's 
part of the reason we've been so successful for almost two decades now and intend to continuing to be so. So, 
we don't generally provide any specifics, but hopefully that gives you a little bit of color about where some of the 
R&D is going and why we're excited about our possibilities in the markets we're in.

few years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Robert, Scott here. We're really pleased with the customer adoption of premium, and is – as you know, in the last 
probably 18 months we've introduced premium and enterprise versions of our cloud SKUs. So, previously there 
was really only one price you could pay for say Jira or Confluence with your Service Desk, and we've now sort of 
got [ph] premium (00:47:31) in those structures. Premium [indiscernible] (00:47:35) ramping up now, so that is 
widely available and widely adopted products, and enterprise is really in the early stages like we've announced, 
certainly we've got some early customers using it but it's still ramping up.
I would say we're [indiscernible] (00:47:47) giving specific numbers. We've been extremely happy with the 
premium adoption of our products. We're still in the stages as we add more features, they get adopted at a higher 
rate and the satisfaction for those customers has been really high. As a reminder, the premium version of their 
products include feature differentiation and they also include high [indiscernible] (00:48:08) for customers where

customers. So, yeah, very excited and very happy with it.

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
In the launch of Atlassian Ventures, can you help us frame the positive impact they might have on ecosystem, as 
well as future marketplace revenues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. I just want to add one thing. I'll get [ph] to Ventures (00:48:34) on premium and enterprise additions in the 
cloud. A reminder that most customers will tend to migrate, and obviously migration is going very we'll, we're up 
about 90% year-on-year in terms of the number of users that are migrating. And obviously of a small base, but as 
we continue to increase that with tools and with partnerships, that's going to grow. Most customers will migrate 
probably to cloud standard, and then over time as their cloud journey – as they increase their confidence in 
Atlassian's cloud and they need more features and capabilities, once they're in the cloud they'll then sort of move 
up through premium and enterprise depending on their company and their journey. So, just to be clear, I'm not 
sure people will necessarily move from on-prem straight to cloud premium. That will be as they mature in their 
Atlassian journey.
On Atlassian Ventures, look, we're obviously incredibly excited about this. We've done a few investments in the 
past as Atlassian. This is, I would say, a sign of our maturation as a company. Having a formal brand, a formal 
budget, and a team that is focused on doing this allows us to better serve the ecosystem and economy around 
Atlassian, right? It's not all about acquisitions. There's a lot of work to be done in investments and partnerships, 
and we'll just continue to mature and grow in stature in all of those areas as we become a part of the larger-scale 
tech economy, and I think it's a great step for us to continue to go, albeit done with Atlassian's general pragmatic 
long-term focus on how we do this. So, obviously that's not a short-term issue.

Hey, guys. This is [ph] Quinton (00:50:20), on for Jim. Thanks for taking our question. Just two high-level

way to think about the revenue contribution today outside of the core software dev market? And then additionally, 
wondering if you guys have seen any material changes in the hiring of developers or IT professionals in general

Scott here. And [ph] Quinton (00:51:04), great questions. What we're seeing in the dev and [indiscernible] 
(00:51:09) markets is the continual overlap of those markets. And so, if you – people like to put them in the street 
buckets, but these days mostly what I see people are doing use involving software and a lot of it – the operation 
staff is running and managing software, and that's an area where we believe we have a unique advantage as the 
vendor that powers more software than anyone else on the planet. We think we have a huge opportunity there to 
bring those two things closer together.

If you think about how we – I've mentioned this before, in terms of planning and managing work during complex 
[indiscernible] (00:51:48), we do an incredible job there and we handle everything from someone putting 
something on that sprint backlog all the way up through the Jira Align and managing 10,000 people. Then through 
developments like there are a lot of vendors there and we actually partner with a huge number of vendors in that 
sort of code and test and deploy side of things.
And in the run side of things, right, run, manage, support area, that's where you're seeing us make a large 
number of investments over the past couple of years, everything from Jira Service Desk which has been in the 
market now for quite a while through to Opsgenie, Statuspage, and the investments that Mike talked about with 
Mindville recently.
So, that is a huge area of investment for us. And as you see, like everyone to build software now has 
[indiscernible] (00:52:32) and those things are closer than ever before. So, we don't break them out as much. If 
anything, we're seeing those lines being more blurred. Developers are now on call and on support. It's not a 
separate team sitting in a network operations center anymore. It's the people that build it, now run it, and so the 
developer [indiscernible] (00:52:52) our products there. So, that was on the first thought.
On the hiring of developers, what you see across the entire industry now is 10 years of digital transformation 
happening in 10 weeks. And so, the demand for IT professionals and developments, and people can build 
software higher than it's ever been. And what you're seeing is organizations saying, well, we want to hire 
developers. And if we can't do that, how do we get our developers to be more productive. And so, you see the rise 
of workflow applications like Atlassians where you can take – you don't necessarily need a software developer to 
make work classifications happen and run across your organization.
You see workloads opportunities which particularly using Atlassian platforms to automate things across their 
entire organization. And automation, which we've invested heavily in and to make sure that all of the busy work 
goes away. And so, in terms of – we don't have specific numbers from many third-party in terms of [indiscernible] 
(00:53:53) developers, but I would expect that to be a pinch points for most organizations for the foreseeable 
future.

from us. And I kind of wanted to touch on Trello. As you've made some kind of changes here in 2019 with the [ph] 
paywalls (00:54:21) and the acquisition of Butler, but kind of thinking, how has the monetization of the product 
changed and then how are you measuring the kind of success from this product looking into fiscal 2021? Thank 
you.

Thanks, Dylan. Look, as we've – we've been on a long-term journey with Trello. We've always said the most 
important thing is to keep the product growing as a whole. Trello is a monster product, tens of millions of users, 
and continuing to grow fast. And from the long-term perspective, having those tens of millions of users continuing 
to grow is the number one priority and we've been pretty clear about that. That said, we have continued to apply

Atlassian's expertise in pricing and packaging to work out how we get the best customer outcomes and the best 
Atlassian outcome so that we can continue to invest in the product. That journey has been going quite well. As 
you mentioned, we've changed some of the ways that it's charged in – a couple of times now over the years, and 
that continues to drive the top line that Trello is contributing to Atlassian. Seems like Butler provide more 
differentiation.
So, that's the sort of automation capabilities for Trello, and you're seeing that with the continued work we're doing 
around Trello to use sort of providing more ways to look. We've got a calendar view and a map view at the 
moment. We've got a table view that's in the public [ph] data (00:55:54) at the moment. So, continuing to have 
different ways to look at the data that's inside Trello. Also gives us some capabilities to look at the different paid 
additions and add different view capabilities as you go through there.
So, I think, look, our continued number one focus for Trello, as I've said, is the user base and continuing to just 
make it a standard. The other thing we're also doing with Trello is continuing to bring it closer to the Atlassian 
family as you've seen with the identity stack underneath moving to the Atlassian identity platform which, by itself, 
handles tens of millions of users, so it's very helpful to bring that Trello user base closer to the Atlassian user 
base over time. And obviously, things like access is a monetization angle across Trello, as well as connections to 
obviously the Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, to Halp, and to Confluence, obviously. So, bringing you closer to 
the Atlassian family is a part of the monetization journey for Trello as well.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. Just wanted to double click on the comment 
around low-code app development. It's an area we're seeing increasing strength, certainly this year, around crisis 
communications or track and trace, et cetera. Any thoughts around furthering efforts here? Obviously, Forge is a 
great first step, but any more color you can share on new use cases and ways you're seeing people use Atlassian 
as a low-code platform in this environment? Thanks.

Apologies there. Sorry. One of the benefits we've had over the long-term at Atlassian is that our products are 
incredibly flexible, and now our customers have used them for all manner of things. And so, we – the Atlassian 
products use everything from HR, recruiting, and onboarding of employees. We've seen them for people – a 
Nasdaq-listed company uses Atlassian's products to handle their quarterly close process in finance. And the 
advantage, I guess, is our products are very fast to roll out. They are widely deployed inside an organization and 
have customization that varies from just changing internal kind of the build interface and configuring workflows

and custom fields, all the way through to our [indiscernible] (00:58:55) Forge, which is Forge application through 
to building complicated applications that are – you can deploy and use around marketplace.
And so, we've seen that as sort of use cases. It'd be too numerous to get into on this goal, but we've seen 
Atlassian's products being used across the entire organization. The example we've said previously, Trello uses 
Atlassian for hundreds of service desks, I mean 140 service desks, so everything from a legal service desk to HR 
across the entire organization. And so, we see Atlassian as a platform where people do move, work across their 
organizations. And as Mike alluded to, as we continue to build out that platform, it gets used for more and more 
use cases.

Charles Zhaoxuan Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Margaret, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. Firstly, to assist better understanding and analysis of our quarterly results, I would like to remind everyone that based on the changes in this quarter, including the sale of Kaola and the NYSE listing of Youdao, we will now be reporting segment report as online games, Youdao and interactive businesses and others, which includes now Yanxuan, NetEase Cloud Music, Internet media, CC live streaming and others.

Kaola's financial results has been deconsolidated and listed as discontinued operations. This applies to the current quarter, as well as the historical comparative periods. This quarter, our total net revenue represents both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth. You can also refer to Youdao's earnings release for more details about its quarterly results.

I will now read the prepared remarks on behalf of William. We have had quite a eventful third quarter with a number of strategic moves made across our business lines. Those moves allow us to realign our resources and sharpen our strengths in areas where we see the most potential for our sustainable long-term growth. During this quarter, we continued to grow our online games business with steady performances from existing titles and further expanded our overseas presence. We are pleased to have achieved another quarter of strong financial performance with total net revenues increasing by 11% and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations increased by 74% year-over-year.

For games, our online games revenue continues to exceed RMB10 billion for the sixth consecutive quarter, driven primarily by the steady performance of the long-running titles in our games portfolio. Our flagship, Fantasy Westward Journey series and Westward Journey series, continue to perform strongly, as two of the longest and largest running game IPs in China. Those games continue to attract a loyal crowd. Fantasy Westward Journey Online achieved another record high quarter of gross billings, since its debut in 2003, 16 years ago, while the mobile version also reached its highest quarter of gross billings in the last two years. While the Westward Journey series, we introduced a brand new dragon character in conjunction with an expansion pack in August, for both the PC and mobile games, which quickly gained popularity within fans. Westward Journey Online also peaked in gross billings this quarter, reaching the highest level we've seen since 2015.

Other games launched in more recent years are also enjoying impressive popularity with highly active core user bases, Invincible had another quarter of record revenue with continued growth in active users. In October, with its fourth year anniversary, Invincible reached number two on China's iOS top grossing chart. Onmyoji also celebrated its third anniversary this quarter and topped China's iOS grossing chart for the third time this year since September. In addition, other games in our portfolio, including our new ghost series, Identity V, all about [Foreign Speech], which previously known as CRX [Phonetic] and Life-After are also enjoying a sizable and steady run rate with their respective large basis of royal fans. Two weeks ago, we launched an updated version of Life-After. The update came with an overhaul of the game, introducing a series of new themes and innovative gameplay, leading to a strong growth in the number of active users and gross billings. These games span different genres, target different user profiles and last a long time horizon. This is how we achieve sustainable revenue base for our existing portfolio of games and the continuously add more and more game titles to this expanding game portfolio. The fans that these games have accumulated over the years and reach of their influence have turned each of them into valuable IP, giving rise to the possibility of more renditions [Phonetic] of these popular characters and story lines.

Most recently, in October, we launched Xuan Yuan Sword: Dragon Upon the Cloud, a Chinese style term-based MMORPG, which topped the iOS downloads chart soon after its launch. And for Bloom & Blade, a new MMORPG we just launched last Friday is also trending well. This game is designed to target female game players and was featured by the iOS app store.

Our joint venture with Blizzard Entertainment has also had a good quarter. In line with our successful 10-year partnership operating Blizzard's World of Warcraft in Mainland China, the popular franchise continues to provide new thrilling game experiences to players across the world. August 27 marks the official launch in China of Blizzard's World of Warcraft Classic, inventive revitalization of WoW as the world's renowned MMORPG, calling on the nostalgia of a generation of old players and intriguing new players alike. This latest release increased both revenue contribution and total number of subscribers for the game.

In terms of overseas revenues, we delivered a record quarter. We now have two blockbuster games in Japan, Knives Out and Identity V, both of which gained top positions on Japan's iOS grossing chart. Life-After, our newer release is also ramping up well in Japan. With the success of Knives Out, we gained a better and deeper understanding of users in Japan, in terms of their interest, social behavior and preferences in style, aesthetics and gameplay. We passed the successful experience and knowledge on to the design of other NetEase games, enhancing our ability to deliver popular titles to Japanese users. Identity V, topped Japan's iOS top grossing chart for the first time in September, while Knives Out remains a household name in Japan among the gamers. To further support our games growth in Japan and stimulate player enthusiasm, we hosted Knives Out Championship, our first ever e-sports championship tournament in Japan from May to August, with more than 500,000 players participating.

In terms of our pipeline of games, we are pleased to have received license for FWJ 3D, which is currently undergoing the final round of beta testing and is scheduled for launch in December. In addition, we are excited to announce plans to release Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, a card game featuring a blend of strategic roleplay elements that invites players to experience the magical wizarding world.

Other games included in our lineup include Onmyoji: The Card Game, Marvel Super War, Onmyoji: Yokai Koya, EVE Echoes, Ghost World Chronicle, Diablo Immortal and Pokemon Quest. While our existing games are expected to sustain our online games revenue at a high-level, the abundant pipeline titles represent opportunities to further fuel the revenue growth for our online games.

Now, turning to our education business. We have completed Youdao's public listing on the New York Stock Exchange in October. This marks our first ever carve out IPO under the NetEase umbrella and the beginning of a new journey for Youdao, to lead our efforts in revolutionizing the way that people learn and receive education.

Following the IPO, NetEase remains Youdao's majority shareholder and will continue to support Youdao's future growth that propels their mission to empower the people of China on their lifelong learning journey. Over the past 13 years, Youdao has become a strong contender in the online education space with clear advantages in Internet-native, tax-driven content offerings.

The Internet has disrupted many industries in the world. But so far it has had a minimum impact on the education space in China. This offers tremendous opportunity for Youdao. Led by Dr. Zhou, Youdao's senior management team is comprised mostly of computer science graduates and doctorates from top universities who are best suited to lead the transformation in the online learning space, enabled by the application of technologies. Both Youdao and NetEase are fully committed to investing in technology and content creation in order to bring to our users more effective and technology-driven education experience.

Moving on to innovative businesses and others. For NetEase Cloud Music, we continue to deliver a highly differentiated music product, with the mission to help tens of thousands of talented Chinese independent musicians, create indigenous content that resonates with Chinese listeners. We strive to provide our users with the most intimate, interactive and high-quality music experience, as we continue to amass more and more of what we call cloud villagers. We know we are on track.

NetEase Cloud Music continues to ramp up its monetization efforts, reaching new record high revenues in the third quarter. Revenue growth has been strong across the board in subscription, advertising and live streaming, leading to continued improvement in our financials. We entered into a definitive agreement with Alibaba and Yunfeng for approximately $700 million in September. With our new strategic partners, we are able to explore more innovative forms of monetization for this highly engaging music platform.

For Yanxuan, the focus continues to be about operating efficiency. During the third quarter, we continued to optimize our supply chain management to reduce our inventory and to deepen our relationships with choice manufacturing partners. We help our manufacturing partners better understand the consumer metrics and provide them with better visibility and ultimately better sales figures. Forging ahead, Yanxuan will continue to focus more on quality control and bring high-quality products to our consumers.

In September, we completed the sale of our cross-border e-commerce business, Kaola, and we are pleased to have found a strategic fit for Kaola within Alibaba's extensive ecosystem.

In summary, we had a busy quarter, being more focused and realizing value for each of our core business areas. We are very confident in the future prospect of the sectors we choose to be in, and we have developed and will continue to strengthen our distinct product offerings in each of these markets. We will persist in our pursuit of excellence across all of our business lines and the needs of our users always remain at the heart of our business strategy. As we advance each of our businesses and create value, we are always looking for ways to increase returns to our shareholders. This quarter, in addition to our regular dividend, representing a 30% payout ratio, we will also be distributing a special dividend of $3.45 per ADS this quarter in consideration of the sale of Kaola business. As always, we appreciate and value the long-term support from our shareholders, and we are always devoted to maximizing the interest of our shareholders.

This concludes William's comments.

I will now provide a brief review of our third quarter 2019 financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. Our total net revenues for the third quarter were RMB14.6 billion or $2 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 11%. And again, let me remind everyone that the revenue has taken into the consideration that we have deconsolidated Kaola results in the current quarter, as well as the historical comparative period.

Net revenues from online game services were RMB11.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by Life-After, which was launched at the end of last year, as well as continued strong performances from Invincible and Identity V. Mobile games accounted for approximately 71% of net revenues from our online games in the third quarter.

Net revenues from Youdao nearly doubled year-over-year to RMB346 million, primarily due to increased net revenues from Youdao Premium Courses driven by higher paid student enrollments and average selling price.

Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB2.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year due to mainly the increased monetization from Cloud Music, partially offset by decreased revenue from online advertising businesses due to macro environment.

Overall gross margin was 53.8% in the third quarter. Gross margin for our online games services for this quarter was 63.8%. Our gross margin for online games is generally stable, fluctuating quarter-to-quarter within a narrowband based on the revenue mix of mobile, PC, as well as self-developed and licensed games. Youdao's gross margin was 25.8%, an improvement from 23.3% in the prior-year period due to increased net revenues from Youdao Premium Courses and down from 32.9% in the previous quarter. Gross margin for innovative businesses and others, for the quarter, was 15.2% compared to 15.5% and 17% for the previous quarter and prior-year period, respectively. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to decreased net revenues from advertising services.

For the third quarter, total operating expenses were RMB4.5 billion.

Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of our net revenue were 11.1% compared with 8.9% in the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to online game services, as well as the summer promotion of Youdao, which is typical in the online education space.

R&D expenses remained steady at around RMB2.2 billion. We remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is what defines us as a technology company.

Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled RMB4.7 billion or $661 million, representing an increase of 21% quarter-over-quarter and 74% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations were RMB36.31 or $5.08 for the third quarter.

Our cash position remains strong. As of September 30, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investment balance totaled RMB61.4 billion compared with RMB49.7 billion as of the year-end last year.

As William mentioned in his remarks, we are pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a dividend of $7.59 per ADS. This includes a regular quarterly dividend of $4.14 per ADS, equivalent to approximately 30% of our net income attributable to the shareholders, plus a special dividend of $3.45 per ADS.

Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead to the Q&A.

Questions and Answers:
Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] For the benefit of all participants on today's call, if you wish to ask your question in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English. Please ask one question each time. If you have more questions, please join the queue again. We will take our first question from Natalie Wu from CICC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Natalie Wu -- CICC Limited -- Analyst

Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the upcoming FWJ 3D. Just wondering if management can give us some color on your expectation for that game. And do we need to worry that game could have the possibility of cannibalizing your current FWJ mobile grossing, if that FWJ 3D could be the next hit game? Thank you.

Charles Zhaoxuan Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Thank you, Natalie. I'll translate that question for William.

[Foreign Speech]

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign Speech] Okay. I'll provide a brief translation of William's response. FWJ 3D is currently scheduled to launch in the first half of December. And we are quite excited about this game because this game represents accumulation of over a decade long of RMB experience both from the PC version, as well as the mobile version of FWJ. And we can assure to the users and the investor community that you're going to see a lot of innovative -- innovation in this game. So this game is -- we are hoping that this game can attract many enthusiastic fans about the Westward Journey franchise and we -- given all these games are in-house developed by NetEase, we are not overly concerned about any internal cannibalization to our existing FWJ PC and FWJ mobile.

Next up, we have Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Alex Poon -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

[Foreign Speech]

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

Okay. [Foreign Speech] Thank you, Alex. I'll provide a brief translation of William's comments for the audience. Firstly, on Music. So in short, yes, we are very actively exploring different opportunities in terms of monetization, that will be reflected in the upcoming quarters as we continue to explore, strengthening existing monetization channels, as well as to apply some innovative brainstorming new features, for instance, social aspects, et cetera, that we mentioned previously.

In terms of our cost control, NetEase as a whole, not only as NetEase Music, we are very prudent and practical in terms of cost control. We think that in order to differentiate our Music business from the competition, we are going to further strengthen sales production, UGC, independent musicians as a differentiated content. As a result, we do not see any material increase in terms of music content acquisition cost. Overall, we are very confident about the prospect of monetization, which will lead the path to profitability. We do not have any definitive timetable for breaking even or IPO. But I think as long as we progress on track toward the mission and those are -- those growth will come just naturally.

To your second question on the overseas games strategy, so as you had mentioned, we've been also quite active in exploring overseas opportunities. The various overseas investments that we made in those studios are mostly valuing their R&D expertise, which we think can supplement to our in-house R&D capability. Equally our NetEase R&D expertise is something that attracts those business partners to collaborate with us. Today, we have achieved a small milestone in Japanese market and we are hopeful that with more new game launches on the global stage, step by step we are also going to have a more promising future in terms of the US and European, Western market.

Next up, we have Hillman Chan from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Hillman Chan -- Citigroup -- Analyst

Hello, William, Charles and Margaret.

[Foreign Speech] Thank you very much for taking my question. My first question is to follow up on the FWJ 3D mobile. During the final beta testing for Android, do we have a sense of the percentage of participants coming from those currently playing mobile FWJ? And also, could you share more observation from the beta testing as well?

And then my -- another question is on the Marvel Super War. Could you share more on the development status and launch timetable? And what other game genres for the Marvel IP under development and the status, please? Thank you very much.

Charles Zhaoxuan Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

[Foreign Speech] Okay. Thank you, Hillman. For your first question on FWJ 3D, as you know, we've started beta testing as early as in the summer. So far, the testing results has been very promising, which leads to our confidence in launching this game in the first half of next month.

For your second question on Marvel IP, as we have reviewed the overall partnership with Marvel on our May 20 game day, there will be multiple games that's going to be developed by NetEase for Marvel IP and Marvel Super War is one of them. I think Marvel Super War is well on track from a development perspective, so this game could be expected in the near-term. Obviously, for Chinese market, this is after all subject to the license approval. But several of these Marvel games are targeting both the Chinese market, as well as international markets.

Next up, we have Kenneth Fong from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Kenneth Fong -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

[Foreign Speech] I have a couple of questions related to the overseas business. First, what is the overseas game revenue as a percentage of our total game revenue?

Second about our game pipeline, which one of you see great potential for the overseas market next year?

Third is, how do you see the competitive landscapes for the overseas game development, especially I noticed that there is a lot of Chinese game developers also very active in publishing overseas? Thank you.

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign Speech] So, Kenneth, to translate William's response and also to add a few more color. In terms of the overseas game revenue, [Technical Issues] above 10% of our overall game revenues and we see great potential in terms of further enhancing both the absolute dollar by overseas game revenue, as well as this percentage ratio.

To your second question, in terms of game-specific product line-ups for the various international markets, apologies for your understanding that we would not be able to elaborate the details here, but there is a solid plan where we say that we are confident to increase the overseas game revenue, as well as the percentage. It is actually bottom-up, it is supported by a very extensive study of the overseas market, as well as our product line-ups.

For your third part of the question, in terms of the competitive landscape of the overseas market, I think that's a good question because when we are launching our products to the overseas market, we realize that in more developed markets like Japan and US, users are actually a lot more sophisticated. The only way to impress, to retain, to attract these users is through product innovation and game quality, that is something that NetEase is proud of our competitiveness. And with that confidence, I think it represents actually a very, very optimistic upside of the overall NetEase games in the markets beyond China.

Kenneth Fong -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

[Foreign Speech] Thank you.

Up next, we have Jialong Shi from Nomura. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Jialong Shi -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my call and congratulations on a solid quarter. Let me first ask my questions in Chinese.

[Foreign Speech] I have two questions. The first question is about the online gaming business. So I was just wondering when Company will officially launch the upcoming new mobile game, Harry Potter. And also, I was wondering, what Company did to -- in Q3 to have helped the two legacy titles, FWJ and WWJ2 to achieve record high growth in Q3, respectively.

And my second question is about the online music business. We heard from some media that China's regulator is likely launching investigation into the license in practice between record labels and music streaming companies. So, I was wondering, if management can provide some colors on this ongoing investigation and -- or specifically what potential changes this investigation may bring to the music streaming industry. And related to that, what potential impacts these changes may have on NetEase Cloud Music business? Thank you.

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign Speech] Thank you, Jialong. I'll translate William's response for the audience. Firstly, given that we have abundant line-ups for the game pipeline, William is actually encouraging people try not to focus too much on individual titles, whether it is existing FWJ, WWJ or the upcoming FWJ 3D or Harry Potter, all of these are high-quality games that we self-develop and we are very confident about their performance, longevity and we have a lot more than just those couple of names that we quoted. For the past summer, yes, FWJ and WWJ, both have delivered a record quarter stimulated mostly by expansion packs in the summer. Harry Potter is also scheduled for launch. We don't have a concrete timetable yet, but it should be planned for next year.

On your second question, Jialong, on the Music, we've also learned from the media about potential regulatory investigations and queries into that. Our general attitude is that, for any sort of industry growth, a conducive environment from the players and from the regulators are ultimately longer-term beneficial to serious and long-term players. Our mission ultimately is to ensure that the industry, as well as the passionate Chinese online music users benefit from a healthy and diversified growth of the industry. Overall, we think an appropriate and conducive environment is going to be long-term beneficial to all the players in this sector.

Next up, we have Daniel Chen from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Daniel Chen -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

[Foreign Speech] I will translate myself. I'm asking on behalf of Alex Yao. So my question is, first one is related to PC games. We noticed some of our top PC games such as, World of Warcraft Classic and Fantasy Westward Journey, actually performance is very resilient. So could management talk about the PC game market outlook in next few years? And what are the key growth areas?

Second question is related to some of the new innovative trends. Could management talk about NetEase strategy in this new innovative trends, such as 5G and cloud gaming? Thank you.

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign Speech] Okay. Thank you, Daniel. I will translate William's response and also add on to your first question. Your second question, William commented, that's a great question, that the industry has been noticing these new features. First of all, William thinks that the user recognition of game titles, so any sort of content is ultimately attracted to the content, less so on the different screens or media. So ultimately, it is the best quality content for the different sector of users that dictates who is the winner. Cloud gaming, as well as 5G, all these are great features to supplement to this content creation industry, whether they are going to be a mainstream feature or whether that's going to be disruptive to the overall user experiences, those are all good questions to ponderance [Phonetic] to be further observed. Overall, we think as long as it's content industry, whether it's education, whether it's music, whether it's games, ultimately content is the King, the one who has the capability of developing the highest quality content would always be the ultimate winner.

Charles Zhaoxuan Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

For your first question on the PC games, we have recorded a great quarter in terms of PC games of our portfolio. We've seen both FWJ, WWJPC, as well as WoW Classic delivering quite strong quarterly results. Overall, we think -- obviously, we can't speak for the entire industry but as for us, we are fairly confident about the steady performance of our PC games into 2020.

Daniel Chen -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst

Next up, we have Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Thomas Chong -- Jefferies LLC -- Analyst

Thanks management for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first question is about our Cloud Music business, given that we are going to include more features, such as live streaming to the music side, how should we think about the impact of our short-form video to live streaming?

And my second question is about the OpEx trend. Given the fact that we are innovating a lot of new business, as well as we are also expanding to overseas, how should we think about our R&D headcounts going forward? Are we going to expand our headcounts in overseas? Thank you.

[Foreign Speech]

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign Speech] Okay. Thank you, Thomas. I'll translate William's remarks. Firstly, he thinks that the short video industry in general is actually a positive catalyst to China's online music industry because as you can see, all the presentation of short format video, as well as live streaming require some sort of a music element, which actually helps to promote music popularity.

For NetEase Cloud Music specifically, we now have over 80,000 Chinese independent musicians that's been nurturing on our platform and this figure is growing. We think short-format video is a very conducive way to promote good music. Based on our data and user statistics, we are not seeing short-format video as a distraction or a competition for users screen time and others. We think ultimately user traffic is attracted by good music, Chinese and global alike. Currently, on Cloud Music, we now have almost all the good music of the last couple of decades, those are the core assets that attracts users.

Charles Zhaoxuan Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

And quickly before we wrap up this call, for your second question, on the OpEx trend, our R&D headcount is steadily increasing. In fact, overall, by the end of the third quarter, especially after the summer recruiting season, our headcount has represented a slight increase comparing to last quarter, as well as to the last year-end. I think this is a strong factual evidence dismiss many ungrounded market rumors of so-called massive layoffs about NetEase.

Thomas Chong -- Jefferies LLC -- Analyst

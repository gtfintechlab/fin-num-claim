MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
Operator: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of 
Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the 
Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call. 
I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Senior Manager of Investor Relations. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Martin Lam
Senior Manager-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc 
Good afternoon, and welcome to Atlassian's first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today, 
we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial 
Officer James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons. 
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our first quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's 
website at investors.atlassian.com. 
On our IR website, there is also an accompanying presentation and data sheet available. We'll make some brief 
opening remarks then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements 
to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. 
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such 
statements are made. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial 
results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including 
the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and Quarterly Report on Form 6-K.
In addition, today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures are in 
addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with 
IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus the 
nearest IFRS equivalents, and there may be differences from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other 
companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, 
our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website. 
I will now turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks before we move to Q&A.

Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Thanks, gentlemen, for joining today. We're out of the box in good form in fiscal 2020. This quarter we grew 
revenue by 36% year-over-year and generated more than $62.4 million of free cash flow. We also added over 
7,000 net new customers during the quarter and now have more than 159,000 customers in total.

This quarter, we introduced two important new additions of our Cloud offerings: Free and Premium. Our disruptive 
business model continues to win new customers, both large and small, and these new additions offer them more 
choice and capabilities. We want it to be easier and less costly for teams to get started in the Cloud and grow with 
us as they need to change and become more complex.
Premium illustrates the increased sophistication of our enterprise cloud offerings, providing large companies the 
flexibility and the tools they need. We are also excited to have acquired Code Barrel, the creator of Automation for 
Jira. As a platform for managing work and workflows, Jira is in a unique position to help automate manual steps in 
a workflow to help people and teams advance work more efficiently.
Automation is increasing [indiscernible] (03:30) customers because it helps them move faster and collaborate 
more effectively. Automation for Jira is already used by thousands of teams, and this is another important step as 
we continue to enhance our Cloud products. We provided more detail on these announcements along with many 
other updates in our shareholder letter that was issued earlier today.
And with that, I'll pass the call over to the operator for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with 
Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Heather Bellini
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit just because there's been some 
concern over the past few days about if you've started to see any change in the customer buying patterns, right –
I mean, I know you guys don't have a direct sales force, but I know James has obviously seeing different cycles 
from time to time being at different companies. But any sense that there's been any change in the demand 
environment?
And then I had a follow-up question. Just if you could share with us anything about any potential impact you saw 
from the from the price changes. If there's a way to help think about the impact on the quarter or whether we 
should be thinking about it more similar to kind of the fiscal year 2018 price increase where the timing was more 
similar or is it potentially more like last's year in terms of the behavior in deferred revenue. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Heather. Let me start off with our answers. First of all, I wouldn't say we've seen any material change in 
customer buying patterns. We've been pleased by the results, the overall strength right across the product set and 
our different deployment options. So, nothing material in that regard. Reaction to price increase, Jay, if you want 
to start off with that one, and then I can come back on some of the timing items.

I think similar to how we've reported in the past, it was in-line with expectations. So I think customers – and part of 
that is just around the plan that we do that goes into the increases that we do communicate to customers and the 
way we communicate those price increases to customers. So I think we're pleased with how it's been adopted.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. And in terms of the timing, we announced our price increases at the start of this past September. And so a 
couple of weeks earlier then was the case a year ago and so more in-line with the timing of fiscal 2018. And so for 
that reason, we expected that there would be some additional customer activity in Q1 as there was in Q1 of fiscal 
2018, and that there would be potentially some of that bleeding over into Q2 as well, again, as there was in fiscal 
2018.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Heather Bellini
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. I found it interesting just in follow-up to Heather's question 
that your EMEA revenue growth actually reaccelerated this quarter just given again some of the macro and other 
concerns that we've all heard about. Is there anything that you would call out with respect to your strong execution 
in EMEA?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thank you, Gregg, for the question. Recall that over half of our partners are based in EMEA. We have over 500 
partners around the world, and they have tended to be quite active helping their customers, our customers step in 
front of the price increases. We saw this in the last couple of years. And while that activity generally impacts our 
deferred revenue balances, there are, I think as we've discussed in the past, a couple of revenue drivers there as 
well. And so that is a part of what's driving those strong results. So, both in EMEA and in APAC as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay, that's really helpful, James. Thanks. And then just as a follow up, I realize that we're only one quarter, of 
course, into fiscal 2020 but just relative to your prior guidance for the cloud mix shift to cause because a 100-
basis-point revenue growth headwind for the year. Have you seen anything at this point that perhaps might tilt you 
in one direction or another or do you still feel that's probably the right landing spot for the Cloud impact this year? 
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, and I would continue to say that that 1-point headwind to revenue growth year-over-year is what we're 
expecting. Recall, that there were three elements to that when we talked about it 90 days ago. The first, launch of

Free editions of Jira software and Confluence. The second thought that we would offer free trials of our Cloud 
product to the user of that same product behind the firewall.
And then the mix shift that you're referring to in the question. And one of the other things to recall is that we just 
rolled out the Free versions of Jira software and Confluence just quite recently. And so, continue to be of the view 
that that 100-basis-point headwind is the right way to think about those three issues combined.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay, terrific. Thanks very much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. Two questions. One on sort of the new customer 
adds, you, I guess, have been adding customers at a really nice clip, saw a really good growth in that net new 
customer adds this quarter of like 20% on a year-on-year basis. Anything in particular driving that's kind of 
stronger new customer adds in Q1? And anything in there that wouldn't be repeatable for the rest of the year? 
Number one.
And number two, another acquisition, sort of going deeper into sort of the opportunity around Jira and some of 
that core IT. We haven't heard as much about this stuff outside of the IT department. Can you just give an update 
on kind of how we're thinking about the opportunity for Jira outside of the IT department? And is the focus still 
there in the same way it had been historically in terms of expanding the use cases outside of those core IT's 
cases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Keith, Jay here. I'll take the first part, and then hand it off to Mike on the second one. In terms of customer 
growth, really contribution across the board from all the major products that contribute to the new customer adds. 
As we talked about last quarter, there's one component in there related to the monetization improvements that we 
introduced to Trello around board limits for team usage. And there is some nascent pent-up demand within the 
existing customer base that's contributing to the number, not in a materially outsized proportion, but it is in there. 
And that's maybe one component as we roll through a year of those monetization improvements in the base that'll 
moderate a little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And just one thing to add on to that briefly, we continue to see more than 90% of those new customers going 
straight to our cloud services. Mike?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Hi, Keith. Look, we obviously continue to remain bullish and focused on the opportunities both inside and 
outside the IT and software department. You referenced the acquisition of Code Barrel. Obviously, Automation is

an area that we already have quite a variety of offerings in now in Trello, in Opsgenie, and we had some 
Automation features in Jira Service Desk.
This really lets us expand that Automation offering across the whole Jira platform. So when you talk about non-IT 
teams, where does that mainly exist? Obviously, Jira Core, just for business workflow and process management 
at all sorts of levels, this Automation fits directly inside of that sweet spot for companies that are modeling all sorts 
of processes on top of Jira already. This just gives them extra super powers.
And then within Service Desk, it's also incredibly important because Service Desk, while it continues to land very 
strongly in IT, does expand very well outside of IT to all sorts of other flow-based teams within an organization, be 
it in legal or finance or HR, workplace management, any of these sorts of things, that Automation obviously works 
very well in those areas as well. Obviously in this case, Automation doesn't affect Trello or Confluence or anything 
else we sell outside to business teams. But from an Automation point of view, yes, very, very strong for the whole 
Jira platform both inside and outside IT.
And obviously for us, the core of that business is a bunch of really kickass people that came from Atlassian to 
start with. So we know the people really well and I think it's going to work really well. We're very happy.

Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Excellent. Thank you, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of our Arjun Bhiata (sic) [Arjun Bhatia] (13:11) from William 
Blair. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the acquisition that you were just 
talking about. Just to try to get a better understanding of how you might integrate this into Jira and how you might 
monetize it, I think I read that it's largely sold through the marketplace today. But can you maybe just walk us 
through how the monetization model might work? Is this something that you plan to introduce on the Premium 
products only or is this going to be widely available across all Jira tiers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Arjun, Scott here. Look, we've had some success. We acquired Butler and did something similar where we had a 
lot of success at packaging and part of it in our Premium, [indiscernible] (14:02) part of it in our also a standard 
offering to customers to get a taste of it. And [ph] the industry growth (14:07) position, I think we'll also have some 
existing customers particularly around the existing companies in terms of transition period. So there's a lot of 
things to consider there, but we do think it will help bolster our Premium offering over time, and this is something 
our customers are really interested in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks. And then maybe on the freemium products that you launched, the freemium for all the three tiers 
of Jira and Confluence. Can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing from customers in the initial phases of 
this launch? I know it's still early, but are you seeing a big uptick of new customers coming in into that Free tier?

And maybe on the other side, what are you seeing from existing customers that used to be paying but might have 
– moving down to the Free tier? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yes. Well, if I think about our disruptive model over the years, like we've always tried to make sure our products 
are accessible for every size company. The start-ups is coming out of university. People are just starting to treat 
us as an organization all the way up to people that use our things with 30,000, 50,000 people and to expand that 
gamut.
And that we've always had our pricing to appeal to that. If I would go back to 20 years when we started and with 
the Fortune 500 could afford software and we pioneered the model to make software affordable to companies of 
all sizes.
And if you go down with Free and Premium, it's continued to improve that in the Cloud. And on the Premium side, 
it's making sure our largest customers have the features that they need to continue their expansion in the Cloud 
or to move their on premises deployments to the Cloud. And on the Free side of things, it's around to make sure 
again that those companies at the moment charge – cover all the months that the [ph] barrier (16:01) of the credit 
card, if we can remove that, we believe there'll be a large increase in the funnel there.
Now one on the Free, I think your specific question was how much it's opened the funnel. We're not in positioned 
to talk through that at the moment. So apart from saying that we are pleased by the results internally of how that 
is going, but it's still early days, and we'd want to look at some of those things from cohorts over a long period of 
time to make sure that it really uplifts. But irrespective I guess of the short-term benefit, the long-term benefit is 
ensuring that every single companies of every size can use Atlassian's products.

Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Okay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And just to emphasize what I was mentioning earlier about that effect of Free being embedded within that one 
point headwind to our revenue growth rate in FY 2020.

Hi. This is actually Robert Majek on for Michael. It sounds like Opsgenie is doing really well as part of the 
Atlassian family. Can you just give us some more color there, the changes you've made that led to an accelerated 
growth rate? And maybe more broadly, if you can just talk more about the long-term opportunity for that asset.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Michael, it's Scott here again. We [indiscernible] (17:19) thought about the Opsgenie acquisition. We just actually 
had a party in our office to celebrate one year of closing last night. So it's great. It seems like only yesterday. The 
acquisition is doing really well inside Atlassian and [ph] if you'll get a space (17:36), the incident management 
companies around the world are struggling to how do they release software at a faster pace. How do they keep 
up with their competitors? And are you seeing a whole movement around things like DevOps? And a big part of 
that is making sure that when incidents happen, as they naturally do, that people can respond quickly and have 
the right people available, and that's what Opsgenie does.
Now, Opsgenie, we're pleased with some of the integration that we've done on the product side, the identity side, 
on the user space side, but I still think we have a lot of opportunity there to put those products together with our 
large existing base. And we have seen a doubling of the rate of [indiscernible] (18:19) since we acquired the 
company. I think we'd put in our shelves later. And that's been great. And we still think we have a long way to go 
in terms of introducing our existing customers to the Opsgenie product.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Majek

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is 
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah. Thanks. I just want to follow up on that thread, just in your shareholder letter talking about the Free tier 
doubling the pace of growth for Opsgenie from a user perspective. When you see that kind of result, is that how 
you might think about future M&A that you can really accelerate a product in market where maybe as a standalone entity, a company just can't get to that kind of growth rate? That might change how you think about future 
M&A, or do you think that was really specific to the markets that Opsgenie serves? So I guess the question is 
when you see that impact, do you think you guys might want to be a little bit more aggressive in M&A?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I'll take that. Scott here. And Mike might want to add something at the end. When we think about M&A, we 
think a couple of things. Firstly, it's got to be a great culture fit for the company. That's first and foremost. It's very 
hard to change culture. Second, it has to be a mission fit. So there's no point acquiring companies that don't work 
with our mission which is to unleash the potential of every team.
And third is the business model fit. It's more difficult though not impossible to change a company's business 
model, take it from low volume, high price to high volume, low price, for example, is a difficult thing. And then after 
that, we consider technical and other things.

And so if we do find companies that align with our mission, with our culture and with our business model, we will 
consider them. And we do believe that our base of 159,000 customers and millions of teams around the world is 
something they're interested in other products that we can bring to market for them, both acquisitions and new 
products that we'll develop organically.
So any opportunity is really large. We're not about kind of acquiring stuff for revenue's sake. There's a lot of things 
that we could – just random things introducing to our customer base that may bring short-term revenue but don't 
bring us closer to our mission, and we want to be very disciplined about not going out to those types of 
opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Great. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I would just add one small thing. Obviously you've seen us make a series of changes in Opsgenie and it's 
obviously we're generally pleased about how it's going. I do believe companies have a DNA. We obviously have a 
long-term philosophy, a DNA of having a long-term philosophy and making changes [ph] that have patience 
(21:16) over the long term. As Scott mentioned, 159,000 customers. We have a massive distribution engine for 
software, but you still have to have fantastic applications with really great feature sets.
Opsgenie has the best features in the market, and we have an ability to put a disruptive price against it to really 
make a huge dent. I think that fits our DNA in a really, really good way. So part of the reason we've been so 
excited about the team since they've come on board, and we're starting to see some pretty great results. Taking 
our model up against big enterprise software is something that we're very familiar with doing, have almost 20 
years now history of success in doing so and intend to continue that.

J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company Q
Great. Thanks. And nice job on the quarter. I wanted to touch on what you're seeing in terms of rate of activity 
from customers moving from server to either Data Center or Cloud. And I guess on Cloud specifically, now that 
you've got Cloud Premium out, I know it's still very early, but, I mean, as you look over the next 12 to 24 months, 
do you see migration being more gradual as enterprises slowly get more comfortable or do you see perhaps more 
of a hockey shape just with more acceptance of Cloud and the advance that you're making with your Premium 
SKU?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Derrick, Jay here. We talked a little bit about this on the last call. I mean, we're seeing increasing interest in 
Cloud generally but also in Cloud from our server customer base. And so part of what we've been invested, we 
made big investments in migration tooling just to make that process simple. We've made some pricing calibration 
adjustments to make it easier for customers to move. And then we're working a lot more closely with customers to 
make sure that the planning of that move and the implementation of that move is smooth.

I think and just in terms of the demand environment, it's increasing at a steady clip. And I think what we've 
signaled last quarter is just the investments that we've made over the past year and just the readiness to make 
sure that when customers do want to move, because it is both – in some cases it's a re-platforming. It's saying I'm 
going to take an instance that I have three or four or five years of history with, and I want to move that smoothly 
from infrastructure that I'm hosting to managing to infrastructure that I no longer have to manage because 
Atlassian can do a better job of it for me.
And then Data Center is a little bit of a different, not even a migration pattern, it's basically an upsell from a 
standard version of server on-prem to a high availability instance of the on-prem infrastructure, and that's still a 
motion that really, really large customers are choosing, which is fine because we're celebrating the customers' 
choice to either remain on-prem or go to cloud if they want to.

And just a couple of things to emphasize what Jay was saying there. We're obviously very pleased with the rate of 
growth of our subscription business, which encapsulates both our Cloud and Data Center business. So that grew 
50% in Q1. And then you mentioned the potential effect of Cloud Premium. As I've said in the past, I wouldn't 
expect Cloud Premium offerings for JSW and Confluence to drive the material revenue effect in FY 2020. I think 
we see the benefits of that downstream.

Nikolay Beliov
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the last question, you've put in place channel incentive, 
product incentive, pricing incentive to steer the server customer base to the Cloud version. Do you envision this 
being, I don't know, like two-, three-year process or five-, six-year kind of like transition of that installed base and 
the $400 million worth of maintenance to Cloud?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I mean, the transition will happen over years. It'll be gradual.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikolay Beliov
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Okay. And, James, question for you, you raised the revenue guidance for the year in-line with the Q1 bid. I'm just 
wondering what kind of puts and takes you're considering for the rest of the year as you provided the updated 
guidance for the year? Thank you.

Well, this is the midpoint of our original guide 90 days ago, we've obviously raised beyond the Q1 beat quite 
substantially, and this reflects our ongoing confidence, as I said, right at the outset of the call across the products 
and across the deployment options. So really, that's the logic behind the moves that we've made today on the 
guide.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gray Powell
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Great. Thanks for taking the question. So on an absolute dollar basis, you added more revenue to the 
subscription line than any prior quarter ever. I know you're not going to give exact numbers, but like maybe 
broadly speaking, how much of that is being driven by just normal demand versus customers shifting from server 
to cloud?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, I would say that the gradual server-to-cloud transition is building momentum, but what I really would say –
and when you think about that subscription growth rate, it just represents the underlying strength of both the 
Cloud business and the Data Center business. So we're pleased by how both of those business lines are growing 
very substantially.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luv Sodha
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Congrats again on a strong quarter. I had a couple of questions. One was 
given the impressive subscription year-over-year growth rate of 50% this quarter, I know last quarter you guys 
mentioned that you would hit – grow over 40% year-over-year for subscription. So is there any update to that?
And then the second question was really that this is the first time you guys have done price increases on the Data 
Center product. So has there been any initial reaction to that and from customers if you have seen that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yes. So let me take the first part of that. So in terms of the subscription business, we guided at the outset of the 
year that we thought we could beat 40% growth year-over-year. Obviously the Q1 result is a very nice down 
payment, if you will, on achieving that objective. So, nothing to update around that at this time. In terms of the 
price increase activity around Data Center customers, Jay, would you want to take that one?

Jay Simons

Yeah. I know it's a fine reaction. I mean, the price increase in Data Center was super nominal as you mentioned. 
It was the first adjustment we made to Data Center pricing since introducing it four years ago.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jack Andrews
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Well, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could speak about the broader 
demand trends in competitive landscape as it relates to Trello. It seems like in this broader collaboration space, 
more companies are increasing some focus and investments there. So I was wondering, are you seeing any sort 
of inflection in the demand for more general collaboration tools?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, good day, mate. Look, I mean, I would say more general collaborations will continue to be something as 
that growth as business evolves, right? People are getting more comfortable with using these types of tools. You 
have obviously people joining the workforce who are incredibly comfortable with mobile-based collaboration apps 
and things like that, but nothing unusual in the last quarter over a general shift towards collaborative tools both, as 
we would say, in specific domain.
So I would argue that Jira, Confluence, other tools we have are actually modern collaboration tools. They have all 
of the modern collaboration features from our Teamwork Platform but focus on specific domains, whether it be 
project management, workflow management or document collaboration, but nothing particularly changing other 
than a general movement in our direction, which is obviously the way we intend to be.

Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two here. First, on Trello, I mean, now up to 50 million users. Can 
you maybe help us understand if you've seen pretty good traction in specific industries, lines of business within 
organizations, specific geographies? And alongside that, on the monetization side, I know you introduce board 
members relatively recently and that seems to be helping but maybe help us understand what the path to 
monetization for Trello looks like going forward.

And then on the Automation for Jira and the acquisition there, maybe just help us understand the technology a 
little better. Is this similar to the Butler acquisition for Trello or is this more robust maybe even slightly similar to an 
RPA offering? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Rishi, I'll certainly take the first half there. I guess I could take second half too. Look, on Trello we continue to be 
extremely positive. As we said in the shareholder letter, we passed 50 million registered users this quarter, which 
is again a huge jump on last year and continues to power along really nicely. So, as we say pretty much every 
quarter to you, guys, the first goal is to continue Trello growing the way it's growing. And I think we're sort of 
ticking that box and continue to travel well there.
Those users are all across the globe. It's a very global phenomenon. It's an application that works as well in 
Android in Brazil as it does in iOS in America or on a desktop in Australia. So in terms of a global application, it is 
very, very large, and I think we're showing in the numbers that we can continue to grow it very strongly. We are, 
as you mentioned, starting to monetize it more in the last sort of 6 to 12 months, seeing good traction happening 
there.
Just in terms of managing how we separate between the free and paid offerings, you mentioned board limits. A 
few other small tweaks and changes we've made to monetization and pricing. I would just say again that comes 
from my sort of long-term patient philosophy as a company and our DNA of being very, very expert at how we 
optimize pricing for different customer groups and customer segments, and make sure that that drives, firstly, 
growth, and then second, value to Atlassian after we deliver value to our customers.
And Trello is no different there. The only difference with Trello, I point out, we're still not actively cross-flowing 
users to other Atlassian properties yet. It's on the list, we'll get there, but we're not actively looking at today. The 
other two parties are taking more of that in the short term.
I guess I can take the Automation for Jira. Look, technologically, I'm not sure what depth you want in answer to 
that question. It's similar to Butler in some ways in terms of how, I guess, it works in Automation, obviously built 
completely differently. Inside of the Jira stack, it's a very different world.
For the basics of things like RPA, for sure, you could use it to automate some of this, but it's not – I wouldn't say 
it's a competitor to RPA tools in that way. It's more about automating, I guess, repetitive – or tasks that you don't 
necessarily need to do.
So I've given the example of our legal team uses Service Desk very heavily to manage incoming contracts and 
move them around. They can look for missing fields, missing data, other things they would need, and bounce it 
straight automatically back to the user to get more information or to move it to the next stage in the workflow 
without one of our very expert lawyers with their legal degrees having to spend time moving tickets around, which 
they shouldn't have to do, right? They want to focus on high-value work that leverages their skills, and Automation 
just lets us take that to our millions and millions of Jira users around the world. So I think we're incredibly positive 
about the impact it can have.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Iwanyc
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my question. So just another one on Code Barrel from an expense perspective, is the 
acquisition going forward some expenses and is that kind of embedded with maintaining the operating margin 
guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, that's – George, we've embedded all of that within the guidance. That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Iwanyc
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Are you accelerating investment in other areas internally as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, I wouldn't point to any particular acceleration driven by the acquisition per se. Obviously, we're very pleased 
to be adding the Code Barrel team. And as I say, we've catered to each of the effects there within the guide that 
we've issued.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Iwanyc
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Okay. And just broadly speaking on the IT side, has the competitive dynamics changed at all with the ramp of Jira 
Service Desk and Opsgenie and all the other efforts that you're doing focused right there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Scott here. The competitive dynamics I don't think have changed significantly over the last couple of quarters. So 
we feel increasingly confident about our position. As we've sort of mentioned before, IT and software have 
become increasingly closer together and that's an area that we have a real strong market position given we have 
a large number of software developers and tools and products to help them be productive. And as those teams 
work closely together, they ultimately have one stack to pull those things together. So from that we go, I guess 
increasingly confident about our position in the market. But in other people out there, I don't think there's any 
major changes in the competitive dynamic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Iwanyc
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Okay. Thank you.

Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the

Tyler Scott
Vice President, Investor Relations, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received the copy of the earnings 
release and investor supplement for the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. If you have not,

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the 
responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk 
and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide 
useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Throughout 2021, clients have meaningfully accelerated spend on 
digital transformation initiatives, accelerating the demand for IT services. Elevated attrition in key digital scales is, 
however, a direct consequence of this, creating revenue fulfillment challenges and cost pressure that need to be 
carefully navigated. I'm therefore pleased that we had another quarter of solid execution, delivering against our 
commitment to clients and to you, our shareholders.
Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, above the high end of our 
guidance. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin 
was 15.3%, and full year adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, in line with our guidance.
During the quarter, we also progressed against our key strategic initiatives, including scaling our digital capability, 
globalizing the company, helping our clients be successful by leading with greater industry insights and solutions 
and repositioning the Cognizant brand.
Turning now to industry segments, our recovery in Financial Services continued with fourth quarter growth of 19% 
year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an approximate 9 percentage point benefit from the impact of 
the prior year charge related to Samlink. As you know, we've been rebuilding our strength in Financial Services by 
refreshing our leadership in client-facing teams, strengthening our partner engagement, shifting our portfolio of

services to more attractive market segments and sharpening our focus on priority industry solutions and clients. 
We expect to build further on this progress in 2022.
As we reposition Cognizant as a digital transformation provider in larger banking clients, we've complemented this 
with sustained momentum in regional banks. KeyBank, where we've just renewed our engagement as their 
primary digital partner, is a great example of this. We will further enable their digital transformation by digitizing 
their products to increase their digitally-active customers to approximately 85%, by driving remote self-service 
growth by more than 40%, by automating front-to-back processes and by migrating more than half of their 
application portfolio to the cloud.
In insurance, we see continued demand for core modernization and digital transformation, including cloud and 
analytics. Unum, a global leader in disability insurance and group benefits, is partnering with us to pursue their 
digital transformation focus on agent and customer experiences and associated analytics. These digital solutions 
enhance our existing application development and maintenance services relationship with Unum.
And for a long-time client, Royal London, the UK's largest mutual life, pensions and investment firm, we're now 
extending our partnership to reimagine their customer engagement through personalized, seamless, connected 
customer journeys enabled by cloud, data and customer-centric principles.
In Healthcare, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. We've substantially increased our 
competitiveness in Healthcare by investing in digital solutions, domain expertise and partnerships, and by 
modernizing our core platforms. We've seen continuing momentum in our TriZetto product business, which grew 
13% in 2021. We continue to add new footprints and in 2021 increased a number of overall members supported 
by our platforms to approximately 210 million.
We see solid commercial momentum across our Healthcare payer and provider business. For instance, Humana, 
a large national payer, is modernizing and moving their legacy ecosystem to the cloud and has chosen Cognizant 
as a partner for agency, marketing and clinical transformation. These initiatives will help improve Humana's 
customer and employee satisfaction, reduce costs and enhance the delivery of integrated personalized 
experiences to their members.
We also have momentum with next-generation healthcare companies like Reliq Health Technologies, a rapidly 
growing global telemedicine firm, which turned to us to expand their care management capabilities. Reliq will 
leverage Cognizant care management services to support the deployment of their care platform across managed 
care organizations, hospital networks and health insurance providers.
In life sciences, we partnered with AbbVie, a leading global biopharma company, to help advance their digital 
transformation in safety and risk management, which will improve patient care and outcomes. Through our digital 
health consulting services, augmented by capabilities in human-centered design and digital product engineering, 
AbbVie can understand the needs of patients and care providers, design fit-for-purpose solutions that support the 
patient journey and incorporate feedback for ongoing innovation. These improvements will help AbbVie better 
support patients and care providers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and products.
Within Products and Resources, we continue to deliver our excellent growth in client success across travel and 
hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Drawing on our extensive experience helping 
automakers streamline their operational tasks, Volvo Cars chose us to help harmonize their finance and 
accounting and procurement processes and implement intelligent process automation to support their digital 
transformation. This is a great example of our growing momentum in digital business operations, which

significantly outpaced the BPO industry in 2021 and is set to continue to gain share. Top line growth has been 
fueled by momentum in intelligent process automation and strength in our digital-native client portfolio.
Our work at Grundfos, a global leader in water technology and the world's largest pump manufacturer, perfectly 
illustrates our growing digital credentials. Grundfos initially selected Cognizant to establish an IoT-based 
intelligent platform to gather real-time pump data from the sensors and perform analytics to prevent, predict and 
respond to issues caused by leakages. Based on this success, we've since been selected to build a modern 
enterprise system based on SAP S/4HANA.
Finally in Communications, Media and Technology, we saw continued strength in technology, in particular, where 
we've sustained strong double-digit growth over the past three quarters.
Turning now to bookings, which grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, our second consecutive quarter of 
20%-plus growth. Full year 2021 bookings growth was in the mid-teens. We entered 2022 with a healthy book-tobill ratio of 1.2. Throughout the year, our bookings strength, which has been fueled by digital, has been broadbased across industries and geographies.
Moving to the macro demand environment, industry demand remains robust and I expect it to continue throughout 
2022. Clients are embracing digital operating models to become more efficient, agile, automated, scalable, 
innovative and indeed, secure whilst also responding to the expectations of their customers and employees for 
hyper-personalized experiences.
Continuing to scale our digital capabilities is at the heart of our company strategy. Digital represented 45% of our 
revenue mix in Q4. As we noted during our recent investor briefing, we believe digital can become 55% to 60% of 
revenue in the coming years. Reflecting our strength in digital credentials, during the fourth quarter, we were 
named an industry leader in 17 new industry analyst reports. They highlighted the company's client partnerships, 
scalability, digital capabilities and expertise as factors in recognizing our leadership.
Accelerating digital is not only a driver of double-digit revenue growth and improved margin, it also fosters greater 
client intimacy and higher levels of employee engagement as we partner on strategic transformation projects that 
leverage advanced skills.
Moving on now to an industry phenomenon, you are accustomed to hearing about the unprecedented competition 
for talent, reflective of the industry-wide demand supply and balance in key digital skills. Fourth quarter voluntary 
attrition moderated a little to 31% on an annualized basis or 28% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, 
when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and 
BPO. We've been working aggressively to mitigate attrition levels whilst intensifying our efforts and focus on 
employee training, promotion cycles, professional development and total rewards.
During 2021, we also facilitated more than 14,000 job moves across 40 countries, continued to revitalize our 
campus recruitment program in India, established new compensation measures and a revised promotion cycle to 
retain employees and invested heavily in upskilling. In fact, our associates completed 23 million hours of learning 
and consumed 130,000 courses in 2021. Given that we compete on our knowledge and skills, we're proud to 
have won 42 awards for excellence in learning and development from the Brandon Hall Group, often considered 
the leading independent HCM research analyst firm.
We more than offset elevated attrition levels in 2021 by accelerating our hiring, allowing us to increase company 
head count by 14%. I'm pleased to say that in recent years we've made meaningful progress in correcting our

delivery pyramid by significantly increasing the number of college graduate hires onboarded in India. In 2021, we 
added a record 33,000 college graduate hires in India, up from 17,000 in 2020. In 2022, we plan to add 
approximately 50,000 in India.
Digital acquisitions have also brought incredible talent to Cognizant. During 2021, we completed seven 
acquisitions that extend our digital leadership, most recent being our fourth quarter acquisition of Devbridge. This 
software consultancy and product development firm expands our software product engineering capabilities and 
global delivery footprint by adding more than 600 engineers, designers and product managers in Lithuania,
Poland, the UK and North America. This extension of our global delivery network complements recent 
announcements in the United Kingdom, Australia and indeed Canada.
In closing, I'm proud of our execution against our strategy in 2021. We've re-established commercial momentum 
and have a healthy book-to-bill ratio. Our delivery teams executed against our commitments despite challenging 
labor market conditions. Our performance in our two largest industries, Financial Services and Healthcare, has 
strengthened. Growth in key international markets such as the UK has meaningfully accelerated. Our digital 
portfolio has been extended and has never been stronger. And we've made significant progress in our people 
strategy, our internal digitization agenda and indeed our brand repositioning.
For several quarters now, I've been holding hour-long open-ended virtual sessions with small groups of 
employees. What I've learned from these intimate sessions as well as from our large virtual town hall meetings is 
that employee pride in the company is building. Employees see not only how far we've come but also clear path to 
an exciting future.
Employees also recognize the consistent execution of our strategy, our commercial momentum and a 
commitment to our purpose, vision and values. This purpose has kept us focused on executing our ESG agenda 
despite the stress for prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Our ESG focus commitment is evident in our Cognizant 
Combats COVID-19 initiative in India, in our intensified efforts to drive a culture of belonging throughout 
Cognizant, in our $250-million philanthropic initiative to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, along with health 
and well-being in communities around the world and many other areas covered in our 2021 ESG Report.
In summary, our broad-based progress allows us to approach the new fiscal year with confidence in our ability to 
execute against the multi-year financial outlook we presented at our November investor briefing.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before 
we take your questions.

Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We finished the year with solid momentum driven by digital 
projects and enter 2022 with bookings momentum and strong customer demand. For the full year, revenue was 
$18.5 billion, representing an increase of 11% or 10% at constant currency. This includes 320 basis points 
contribution from our acquisitions. The charge in Q4 2020 related to the proposed exit from the customer 
engagement of our Samlink subsidiary contributed 70 basis points of growth. I will refer to this as the Samlink 
Impact for the remainder of my remarks.
For the full year, digital revenue grew over 19% and represented approximately 44% of total revenue. Q4 revenue 
was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year or 14.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year 
growth includes 280 basis points of the Samlink Impact and also 280 basis points of growth from our recent

acquisitions. In Q4, digital revenue grew over 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 45% of total 
revenue.
As Brian mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and for the full year. In Q4, 
we have begun providing trailing 12-month bookings, which can be found in the supplemental presentation posted 
on our Investor Relations website. We took the opportunity to enhance our bookings definition, modifying it to 
exclude overlap from early renewals and to include bookings from unintegrated acquired entities. As of Q4 2021, 
trailing 12-month bookings based on our revised definition were $23.1 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 
approximately 1.2.
Moving on to segment results for the fourth quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in 
constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 19%, which includes a positive 900 basis 
points of Samlink Impact. During the quarter, we saw positive trends in our North American banking business, 
where revenue grew high-single digits, and internationally within insurance. Across banking and insurance, we 
are continuing to invest into our talent and digital capabilities while focusing on broadening our client base and 
driving improved profitable growth. In 2022, we expect our recovery to continue.
Healthcare revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by double-digit organic growth in life sciences. Our 
Healthcare payer and provider business grew in the mid- single-digits, driven by our integrated software solutions. 
As we discussed during our investor briefing in November, we see a large and growing market opportunity in the 
Healthcare space, and our capabilities across Healthcare payer, provider and life sciences provide us a unique 
industry perspective and client intimacy that we believe provide ample opportunity to support sustainable growth 
in the years ahead.
Products and Resources revenue momentum continued with revenue increasing 18%, the third consecutive 
quarter of strong double-digit growth. Revenue was again driven by strong performance in manufacturing, 
logistics, energy and utilities, which grew double-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and surpassed $2 
billion in annual revenue in 2021.
Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double-digits year-over-year with quarterly 
revenue now back above pre-pandemic levels. Revenue growth also included 550 basis points from our recent 
acquisitions. Communications, media and technology revenue grew 13%, of which approximately 300 basis 
points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was again led by our Technology 
business, where our work with digital-native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio.
From a geographic perspective, in Q4, North American revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by banking, life 
sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the 
benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. Revenue outside of North America grew 
approximately 33% year-over-year in constant currency, including 13 points of Samlink impact. Growth was led by 
the UK where we saw strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, Products and Resources and 
Communications, Media & Technology segments. We also continued to experience strong growth in Australia and 
Germany, driven in part by our acquisitions of Servian and ESG Mobility, respectively.
Now moving onto margins, in Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.3% as there were no nonGAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved by approximately 
300 basis points driven primarily by the Samlink charge in the prior-year period. As we discussed last quarter, 
merit increases for the majority of employees were effected October 1 which negatively impacted margin in the

quarter. Supply chain constraints and our elevated attrition has kept subcontractor recruiting and other delivery 
costs elevated, while our recently completed acquisitions have also negatively impacted our margin.
While we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth, we have also moderated nonstrategic spend, which has helped partially offset the labor cost pressure. Our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the 
quarter was 22%, below the low end of full-year guidance range, benefiting from discrete items, which we do not 
expect to repeat in the future. Q4 diluted GAAP and adjusted EPS were both $1.10.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or 
net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q4 was $760 million, representing approximately 130% of net income. 
This resulted in a full year free cash flow of $2.2 billion and represented a cash flow conversion of over 100% of 
net income, which was in line with our prior guidance. DSO of 69 days declined by 3 days sequentially and by one 
day year-over-year. DSO will remain a key lever to support strong free cash flow conversion over the medium 
term.
During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares for $66 million under our share repurchase program and 
returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend and spent cash of $255 million on acquisitions. 
In 2021, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and spent 
approximately $1 billion in acquisitions. This was consistent with our capital deployment framework introduced in 
Q4 2020 and reiterated at our November investor briefing.
In support of our capital deployment framework, today, we have also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly 
cash dividend, our third consecutive annual increase and fourth since we initiated the dividend in 2017. We also 
expect to return at least $500 million through share repurchases in 2022, subject to market conditions and other 
factors.
Turning to guidance, for Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.84 billion, representing yearover-year growth of 9% to 10% or 10.2% to 11.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will 
have a negative 120 basis points impact and an inorganic contribution of approximately 200 basis points. For the 
full year, we expect revenue growth to be towards the high end of our medium-term financial framework, which is 
consistent with our expectations at the November 2021 investor briefing.
We expect full-year revenue of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, representing 7.8% to 10.8% growth, or 8.5% to 11.5% 
in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a negative 70 basis points impact and includes 200 
basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. This inorganic assumption includes approximately 100 basis 
points from future acquisitions. Full-year guidance also includes the negative impact from the sale of our Samlink 
subsidiary, which was completed on February 1.
Moving on to adjusted operating margin, consistent with our outlook at the November 2021 investor briefing, we 
expect 2022 to be towards the lower end of our medium-term financial framework. For 2022, our full-year adjusted 
operating margin guidance of 15.6% to 15.7% assumes approximately 25 basis points of expansion at the 
midpoint from 2021. While we are not providing quarterly margin guidance, we expect typical seasonality in 2022, 
which includes stronger margin performance in Q2 and Q3, while Q1 and Q4 are expected to be below our fullyear guidance. In Q1, we expect some modest sequential pressure driven by compensation costs and seasonal 
factors.
Our outlook for margin assumes the industry supply side constraints continue and that attrition remains elevated 
in 2022. In response, we will continue to invest into our talent, including through merit increases, promotions,

career development opportunities and training. This will include hiring of approximately 50,000 recent college 
graduates, targeted lateral hires and the continued use of subcontractors. Similar to 2021, we will continue to 
moderate non-strategic SG&A spend to help offset some of this pressure in the near term.
This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.46 to $4.60. Our full-year outlook assumes interest 
income of $25 million. Our outlook also assumes average share outstanding of approximately 522 million and a 
tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the 
full year.
With that, we will open the call for your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the 
interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes 
from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Essex
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Maybe we can start with Brian. No question, you seem 
well exposed to demand in this environment. But on the supply side, as we sit here, I guess, over a month into the 
first quarter, could you share a few thoughts on attrition and level of confidence you have that we may be on the 
right side of the peak in attrition trends at this point? And maybe share what initiatives seem to be resonating the 
most with employees?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. Hi, Brian. Yeah. What I'd add there is we're in a robust demand environment. That's not a concern for me. 
I'm expecting that to continue in the coming year. And there's lots of [ph] mega (00:28:19) trends that will support 
that statement undoubtedly. But we're certainly in, from my perspective, an unprecedented competition for talent. 
We've seen a slight moderation sequentially on an annualized basis. January has been in line with that. But to be 
very honest, it's too early to call this a trend for the year. There's natural seasonality one expects to see in the 
course of the year coming up to bonus periods, et cetera. As Jan pointed out, we're expecting elevated attrition 
through the course of the year. And obviously, we're going to work very hard to try to mitigate that and try to 
minimize it, the impact on the business.
The implications of attrition, of course, are across financial, commercial implications as well as employee 
implications. And the levers we're using against that is naturally to try and recruit as many people as we can. I'm 
delighted we've been able to recruit – to add a net 41,000 head count year-over-year. And compliments to our 
team, because I think it is core competency of Cognizant in this regard. But, what we're doing in terms of 
employees, as Jan pointed out, as I did too in my script, a lot of efforts around hearts and minds. There's a lot of 
effort around compensation measures, which, of course, is pretty critical. I think it's essential for us to continue to 
show up and post strong double-digit growth, which is helping get a degree of confidence and swagger and 
optimism back into the company. And just continue to support our employees by celebrating success and giving 
them career path potential, which of course, growth does. And on top of that, we've revised the way we think 
about promotion cycles and other such things in the course of the year.

So, it's been a very hands-on engagement for me down through the entire leadership team. In the last six, nine 
months, we spotted this early. We've added more recruiters and we've really put a lot of efforts in place around a 
retention task force. But, be that as it may, as you've seen with many of our peers, attrition is elevated and we 
assume will stay elevated through the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Essex
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe to follow up with Jan, could you maybe frame out the 
scenarios where we might see upside to margins for the year? And is there any rule of thumb for appreciation of 
the dollar versus the rupee and how that might impact margins going forward as we track FX?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. I don't want to up my guidance in my first question for the call, I'd imagine so. We have our work cut out to 
achieve the margin guidance that we did. We feel confident about it, but as you know, we talked about 
compensation measures, but other factors that are impacting our portfolio in a negative as there are positive 
factors. So, I want to point out some of the drivers that, obviously, are helping us.
The accelerated revenue itself is a helper on margin. So that helps. Our digital business continues to be slightly 
more profitable than our traditional business. So, accelerated digital is built into our – solid digital growth is built 
into our plan. And we continue to make progress on our cost of delivery structure with bringing in college 
graduates, which will improve the overall cost structure over time. So, we rely on a number of offsetting factors in 
order to achieve our guidance. And, obviously, any over or underperformance could yield positive or negative 
outcome. So, I stay balanced. We feel good about our 20 to 30 point outlook.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with 
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lisa Ellis
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC Q
Terrific. Thanks, guys, and good stuff here. I had a follow-up question on attrition, but this time more related to the 
senior levels of Cognizant. Can you give a sense for how your attrition levels are running in the top tier levels of 
the organization and what steps you've been taking to retain some of the key leaders that have been driving the 
transformation? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Hey, Lisa. It's Brian. So, let me address that. To be very honest, I'm not at all concerned about that. The majority 
of our attrition is at the junior levels in certain odd skills, and I would say at the senior levels of the organization at 
this moment in time, we're very much, what I would term, business as usual. Promotions, some refreshing of 
talents, if deemed necessary, based on financial results and other leadership attributes, and what is essentially

normal in a company of our size, some retirements, et cetera. So, sometimes we intervene based on 
performance, but this is more classic business as usual operations at this stage. I feel very good about the 
motivation of the team collectively. We're all in this together, it's certainly a team sport as we say internally, and I 
feel as though we're all in the same page. The leaders I've brought in have certainly refreshed their teams, 
strengthened their teams. I will tell you, right now, I feel I have better instrumentation in terms of how to run the 
company than at any time since I've been here in terms of the analytical rigor that Jan and his team has put in 
place. The HR team have done some tremendous work in terms of where we stand there, et cetera. So, we just 
feel – or I certainly feel a lot more comfortable that we're on top of our game, and we know how things are going. 
So, not a concern.

Lisa Ellis
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC Q
Okay. Good. And then a follow-up for you as well, Brian, just on the demand environment. Can you just talk a little 
bit as you're engaging with clients going into 2022, what do you anticipate or you feel is sort of different about the 
demand environment looking forward as your clients are emerging from the pandemic and maybe trying to get a 
little bit back to business as usual?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. Look, I mean, I think to be very honest, clients are well past by now the initial spend hesitancy of COVID for 
a CEO or for anybody in the sales organization. Certainly, the enemy is indecision, and we don't have indecision, 
far from it these days. People have really moved well beyond where we were approximately two years ago at this 
stage. And people are extremely focused, of course, driving digital transformation agendas, evolving their 
business models which is good for us because our portfolio is stronger now than it's ever been before, and it 
allows us to work on high impact work for clients. So, really driving some of the big innovation journeys that they 
have. Now, of course, that leads to discussions around AI and analytics, consumer-centric, if you will, user 
experiences built-on enterprise class applications, obviously, cybersecurity, digital engineering, cloud migrations. 
And throughout the world as I deal with clients, it's always surprising to see how different clients are in terms of 
where they are in client migrations.
I think the one thing that continues to go from strength to strength is, of course, the growing scale of hyperscaler 
cloud providers. They are, from my perspective, certainly shortening innovation cycles, throwing a lot of 
commercial muscle and financial muscle to accommodate or ensure accelerated cloud migrations.
And, of course, in more recent times, they've really evolved towards industry clouds, not just the hyperscalers, but 
also the major SaaS vendors which allow more integrated vertical workflows. And Cognizant's strength therefore 
in areas like Healthcare and Financial Services is of interest to them. But it's very consistent with what we've seen 
before, Lisa, to be very honest, a huge push towards classic modernization initiatives toward data, analytics, 
cloud, digital engineering. And really what I find clients are certainly willing to spend for skills and innovation, but 
certainly expect more efficiencies and a more traditional non-digital work. And we see that on our pricing 
dynamics, and I certainly see that in terms of client strategic intentions in the years ahead.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with 
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darrin Peller
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q
Thanks, guys. When looking at your outlook, your confidence level around your revenue growth, but obviously 
coupled with margins in the right direction, a little more than we had initially modeled for the year ahead. I mean, it 
really does give us more conviction that the pricing power you have is able to offset wage inflation. So, I'd love to 
hear more color on that, if you don't mind, in terms of the environment you're in and whether or not you're able to 
really pass through whatever you need to on the price point side.
And then maybe just as a follow-up to that, are there other – have there been any like advances in decoupling the 
linearity on the business model at all in a greater way over the past quarter into this next couple of quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah, I'll start. Jan, by all means, jump in at any stage. So, Darrin, first of all, pricing remained somewhat stable. 
And as I've just mentioned to Lisa, based on her question, we see differences between the digital work and the 
non-digital side. Clients will pay out for skills and innovation and frankly, availability for resources in digital. Of 
course, that happens to be in an industry where people tend to have MSAs and rate cards that have been agreed 
in advance, so it requires us to interrupt those rate cards, but certainly clients see in their own workforce, as well 
as other vendors a desire for companies like Cognizant to ultimately drive some pricing power given the labor 
trends that we see.
But, of course, price increases can and have lagged talent related to cost increases. We've put a lot of effort 
around pricing, both rate card, intelligence, big deal pricing and it is certainly one of the factors that's inherent in 
our guidance for the coming year. And as I said earlier as well, the fact that we have scaled our digital portfolio to 
approximately 45% of the business pits us into more strategic client projects, pits us against different competitors 
and inarguably provides us with a pricing opportunity as long as we get the gross margin right on digital skills 
versus the classic non-digital skills. But the last thing I'll say just around pricing, of course, because it's inherent in 
your question, it's a margin question. And our margins can also naturally be helped by the type of work we sell 
solution and deliver. So, we continue to focus on evolving the company towards selling and delivering client 
outcomes. That allows us to own more of our pyramid, to industrialize delivery, to better leverage automation and 
optimized our mix as well as our pyramid.
Specific to your other question around decoupling of – I guess, the Holy Grail on the services company to 
decouple revenue growth from head count growth, look, there are many factors at play there as well, including the 
shift to more offshore delivery in the course of the last year. Offshore delivery has increased for us about 2 points, 
year-over-year about 1 point sequentially and that can help margin.
But, of course, it can hurt you in terms of head count growth versus revenue growth or the so-called average rate 
per employee. And it can also change dollar margins, as well as dollar revenue per employee. So, there are 
multiple things at play here. We are a services company. We're committed to being a services company. We'll 
certainly try to optimize and industrialize delivery where we can, leveraging automation, templatization, AI, et 
cetera. But at the end of the day, we are in a head count business and as we scale our head count, we'll scale our 
revenue. And you guys are more than familiar with that model.

Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. Maybe, Brian, you covered it, I think, on the pricing thing, but a little bit of color on the margin expansion, 
because we really have taken a balanced view about the sources of the margin expansion her, and pricing is a 
factor, but it's not the dominating factor. We have other elements like the natural shift of the business towards 
higher margin business. We have a scaling of – you saw this in the fourth quarter. We slowed the growth of SG&A 
in a meaningful way and it's now contributing to margin actually at slower than revenue growth rate. We expect
that to contribute next year as well.
And we have – we hope to see impact from our initiative to refresh our delivery permit and Brian talked out about 
the success that we had of bringing college graduates on. We mentioned this that we're planning to onboard 
50,000 college graduates this year. That will help to streamline our cost of delivery pyramid. And it's also – so, 
there's a variety of factors that drive it. And so, pricing is a factor, but only one among many.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. You may proceed with your 
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
Hi. Thank you. I had two if I could. Brian, if you could talk a little bit about Healthcare and the potential for growth 
during 2022 and beyond. You mentioned TriZetto was 13%, but just what are some of the factors that would lead 
to Healthcare continuing, if not, getting – improving its growth rate to contributing presumably to Cognizant being 
able to break on a consolidated basis the 10% kind of organic growth? I would think Healthcare would be one of 
the key drivers. If you could just talk a little bit about that and then I have a margin question to ask, Jan, after.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. Yeah. Look, it's certainly our ambition to accelerate Healthcare growth. In the November analyst meeting, 
we talked about market growth. But, of course, within our Healthcare business, we have the US Healthcare 
vertical, which is payer, provider, the payer being the vast majority. And then a product business, of course, 
coupled within that and then the less than 50% of our Healthcare business is our life sciences business, which 
continues to grow double-digits.
I feel really great about that, both the nature of our capabilities, the nature of our client intimacy, the global nature 
of those clients and our bookings momentum in life sciences through the course of the year has been frankly 
outstanding and was very strong in Q4 as well.

Copyright © 2001-2022 FactSet CallStreet, LLC
So, candidly, as we're getting after the life sciences opportunity, it's all about continuing to scale bio pharma. And 
then, in this year, we've accelerated a little bit on medical device momentum there as well. You've also seen us, 
Keith, do some targeted acquisitions in the life sciences vertical in the last few years including Zenith, as well as 
TQS more recently.
In the US Healthcare business, a lot of it is about getting the TriZetto business back on track. I think I mentioned 
in the November briefing, our growth rate in 2020 was twice that of – of 2020 was twice that of 2019, and we've 
approximately doubled growth rate again in 2021 over 2020. And that's good in terms of client intimacy and 
relevance, in terms of margins and the pull-through opportunity or the stickiness of Cognizant in those accounts. 
So, getting the payer and provider back into a higher growth trajectory, but making sure that the product-driven 
side of that scales as well is pretty essential to us.
And I've got to be honest, I'm very motivated about where we are with TriZetto. I think it's a fantastic gem within 
the company. Now that we've got growth back, we continue to explore possibilities in terms of where we can scale 
our Healthcare franchise, both in terms of the market within the US, in terms of different applications within the 
ecosystem or different control points as well as exploring how we can scale our Healthcare business into Canada, 
and indeed, into select international markets. I think if we do all of that right, we will drive market growth, if not 
more than market growth. And that's what the team is focused on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
Okay. Perfect. Jan, for you. Thank you, Brian. On the free cash flow margins, I think you said for 2022, you want 
to do 1x net income. If I just do some back-of-the-envelope, that would suggest that the free cash flow margin, 
which is free cash flow divided by the revenue, will be down again this year, I think, perhaps not meaningfully. But 
are there other forces at work you think in free cash flow in 2022 that we should be aware of that might either 
positively or negatively impact, whether working capital, taxes, CapEx? Anything else you want to call out for our 
free cash flow models?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
No. I can give you a little bit the background of our thinking around the free cash flow conversion, which I think I 
mentioned in my script to be around 100%. We did a little bit better this year, had a very good quarter in free. I 
think with all these ins and outs, there is basically maybe a slight increase in capital expenditures in the next year 
that we could see that is related to some more strategic investments internally, but nothing major. We continue to 
be laser focused on our sources of cash from our clients. So we made good progress on DSO this year and that 
focus will remain.
And to be quite honest, I'm drawing a blank on cash. I think cash is going to be – on taxes. I think tax is going to 
be fairly similar to this year, so no major variation on the tax side. So, that's kind of how I expect the cash flow 
situation to evolve for us. So nothing specific comes to mind. Maybe a slight increase on capital expenditures that 
could drive it.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may proceed with 
your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tien-Tsin Huang
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi. Great. Thanks. Hope you can hear me, guys? I think I wanted to ask on Financial Services. Safe to say that 
some of the money center bank headwinds that we've been seeing – you've been seeing are behind the 
company. I know there's a lot of pressure to spend in general amongst the banking side, but just curious how 
you're feeling there, both from a competitive standpoint and from a cyclical standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Look, from my perspective, we've been working on recovering in Financial Services for quite a time. There's been 
a pace of recovery candidly through the course of the year, but the 10% constant currency growth, if I exclude the 
9 points benefit we got from the year-over-year compare from the accounting charge in Q4 last year's results, is 
probably the highest level of constant currency growth we've had in quite a few years. And this has ultimately 
been on the back of a series of things we've been doing, sharpening our focus on our top clients, refreshing some 
of the commercial team as well as, by the way, some of the leadership team, both in delivery as well as in the 
business.
And back to a question I had earlier, that's part and parcel of running a world class company. Sometimes, you 
have to refresh leaders if you're not getting the results you want. We've added a lot of talent with a focus on 
executive engagement at a client-facing level, a lot of collaboration with the hyperscalers committed to their 
industry cloud or financial cloud, and of course, a partner ecosystem. And all of that has now started to bear fruit.
I'm cautiously optimistic around our growing competitiveness there. We are leading more with digital. We're 
leading more with, what I would call, less interviews or staff augmentation-type work. We're getting better margins 
for that, and I think our competitiveness will continue to increase in the course of the year.
Of course, with the decision that we took last year, which was closed ultimately yesterday, I believe, around the 
Samlink sale, we have a compare sequentially and year-over-year in the first quarter and beyond, which will have 
an anomaly that we can talk to in subsequent calls. But generally, I feel that the team have done great work. We 
expect continued improvements in 2022 will be a paced recovery. I'm not suggesting we're back to our full 
strength yet, but we're working both well across the regional banks, but I'm also optimistic around the progress 
that the refreshed leadership team are making with some of the larger global banks. And if we're able to crack 
some of those, of course, that will show up in the numbers as well.
So, generally, I feel as though we're on the right track and the team have worked hard and deserve growing 
momentum in the business.

Rayna Kumar
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Good evening, Brian and Jan. Thanks for taking my question. So, you've now had two consecutive quarters of 
20%-plus bookings growth. Could you talk about the sustainability of that as well as book-to-bill above 1?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. We had 22% bookings growth, mid-teens for the full year, and it's driven obviously by the strong demand 
that we see in the market. It's supported by the investments that we made into our market organization with 
incremental sales capabilities and solution capabilities. And it's aided by a broadening solution set that we're 
developing ourselves as well as our M&A that is contributing to this.
So, we are optimistic about maintaining a book-to-bill ratio that is similar to where we are. That is at least our 
mindset and we have seen really a very consistent execution, very consistent pipeline development and the 
bookings momentum itself has been broad based, has been good geographically split, and it has been, in 
general. Of course, there are ups and downs by smaller business units, but it has been when you lean back, fairly 
broad based, which is all good news basically to assume that we're going to continue on that path.

stable but we're not disclosing components of it.

Yeah. We have a very capable development team and M&A team, of course, proven over the last two years to 
execute steady stream of these strategic acquisitions, mid – small and medium size in nature. And we continue to 
see great opportunities for us to align our strategic goals with that. So, we're bringing already approximately as 
you can see from our guidance in the first quarter, we're bringing already some momentum with acquisition of

question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Mark Togut
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q
Thank you very much. Looking at the slide 13, on-site employee utilization fell to the lowest level in three years, 
which is really the history of this chart and looks like offshore employee utilization fell to about a six quarter low. 
Can you just talk through the utilization dynamics? Clearly, they're tied to the attrition numbers and what are your 
expectations for both offshore and on-site utilization in your 2022 guidance? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. You're right in the observation. There is some impact in the chart by our switch to nine-hour bill week that 
has lowered our utilization. So that is in the last few quarters in there. But the overall dynamic is largely driven by 
the acceleration of onboarding new associates that have some utilization lack in the beginning of their tenure. So 
that was really the biggest driver of a downtick in utilization that we're seeing basically. And so we are kind of 
happy to have a little bit bigger bench to fulfill client needs. So, for us, utilization levels are really at the desired 
level of where we want to see it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Mark Togut
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q
Understood. Just as a quick follow-up, Brian, could you expand upon your comment that you're seeing more 
clients ask for price efficiency in the legacy work? What – how much price efficiency, if you will, are they looking 
for? And are you able to offset that through lower costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. Look, we have obviously embraced automation. We've taken out double-digit thousands of people from our 
fixed price contracts in the last few years, so we continue to automate our agenda. I will say the other thing you've 
seen is our digital mix hasn't scaled as much as we assumed previously because we've been quite successful in 
the non-digital part of our portfolio, arguably more successful than others scaling that and mitigating the 
downside. So it's a street combat every single time you're coming up for renewal.
You want to be clever as well in some of the classic areas to make sure you try and upsell to help modernization 
or beyond and try to get a renewal plus an expansion. But I feel as though we've handled ourselves well in that

regard and we have a lot of effort underway, as I said earlier, to try to continue to evolve the company to an area 
where we are better able to industrialize delivery, which will help ultimately our margins and indeed the quality of 
our delivery. So, I feel pretty good about where we are in that regard.

Relative to the industry growth, I would just point out that we had a one-time impact from Samlink in the Financial 
Services sector. But we – despite that grow over a one-time impact, we expect continued moderate growth in the 
Financial Services group and all other groups should continue with the momentum. So, I think it's a fairest thing if 
you just build a momentum case for our four big industry groups to get a good forecast.

Brian J. Humphries

Yeah. So, look, this is something I'm particularly passionate about. Cognizant's brand internationally certainly 
wasn't known as much as in key industries in North America and naturally in our offshore areas. So we put a 
coordinated effort in place to reposition the brand. We've refreshed a lot of our country leaders across Europe and 
the Middle East, and I think we're seeing the fruits of that labor right now. You saw a 28% growth in the UK this 
quarter. Our UK momentum has been building through the course of the year. It's nicely profitable for us as well in 
terms of relative profitability vis-à-vis other European countries. And we also have a lot of momentum in areas like 
Australia, New Zealand.
So the seniority and the capability of the team we've built allows us to have confidence to deploy M&A, support 
their growth ambitions as well. That's what we did in Australia and that's what we're doing in Germany. You've 
seen the ESG acquisition we did in the last year. So, generally, I feel very optimistic about our potential there. It is 
a year where we had strong bookings. We have to just continue to build on that in the years ahead, but I am –
ultimately, if we're here three, four years from now looking back, I'd like to think this will have been a really big 
success story for us.
Now it's not only about capturing the revenue opportunity, that revenue opportunity which will be fueled more with 
digital-type work more than historical levels also requires more local and a global delivery network. And that's also 
an area where I'm pleased to see the momentum we've had. We announced most recently the buildout in Canada 
in Nova Scotia. But in the last few months, we announced thousands of extra roles across Adelaide in Australia 
as well as the UK in Northern England and Northern Ireland. So, we're doing what is needed in terms of 
partnership, talent, delivery capabilities to get after the market opportunity internationally. And the fruit is very 
visible in our second largest country in the UK, which grew 28% this quarter.

James E. Faucette
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Thank you very much and appreciate all the detail and color that you've provided. Back on the hiring side, how 
should we think about what you are feeling as the appropriate level of pace of hiring in the current environment? 
And I guess as part of that, I'm looking for kind of number of net head count additions, et cetera, going forward. 
And I guess maybe more importantly, how are you feeling about your capacity or infrastructure that you have in 
place to be able to address that, or is that an area of potential investment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
We've been investing behind our recruitment engine in the course of the last six, nine months, as we spotted 
attrition to be a likely industry problem, we got out in front of perhaps others and we moved fast. And you've seen 
a net head count expansion of 41,000 year-over-year since Q4 prior-year period and another 12,000 sequentially. 
Of course, within a given year, subject to when we bring in our college graduates and onboard them, you'll see 
different peaks country by country. But I'm more than confident that we have an engine that is a core competency. 
The team has done an outstanding job for us. We have processes, tools, capabilities in place.
Our brand standing is stronger increasingly, not just in India, but overseas. And some of the brand work we've 
done, both externally as well as our internal branding, has given us more and more confidence that we have 
brand ambassadors in the company to make that happen. So, we are absolutely in the mode of accelerating head 
count as best we can. The lower we can keep attrition, of course, is the most predictive way to do that. And in the 
meantime, as Jan pointed out, we've done the heavy lifting. We've made significant progress around the delivery 
pyramid this year, 33,000, up from 17,000 in the prior-year period, and next year we're assuming 50,000. And if 
needed, we'll try and scale beyond that.
So for me, it's about retention and it's about recruitment and getting the balance right between those. But I'm 
certainly bullish on the industry, bullish on our position within the industry. And I'd like to have more head count in 
Cognizant. So if you know people, send them our way.

Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Regarding capacity, as you know, we are still operating in a largely virtual environment. And depending on the 
development of the pandemic, we'll make obviously decisions in the future. But I think the working model is that 
we're going to settle in a hybrid model. So relative to capacity in the sense of bricks and mortar, I think we feel 
very well equipped to handle the growth and that shouldn't be anything unusual. The re-igniting of the non-virtual 
component will bring some cost pressures in it, but that is reflected in our margin guidance.

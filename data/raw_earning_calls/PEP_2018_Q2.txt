JULY 10, 2018 / 11:45AM, PEP - Q2 2018 PepsiCo Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
When discussing our financial results on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which excludes certain items such as the impact
of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other tax-related items, foreign exchange translation and acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other
changes from our reported results. You should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors
section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.
Now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We will start off with an overview of second quarter performance
and a discussion of each of the operating sectors in a little more detail, and then Hugh will cover the full year outlook.
For the quarter, we delivered $16.1 billion of net revenue, driven by 2.6% organic revenue growth and core earnings of $1.61 per share, a 7%
increase on a core constant currency basis. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the quarter, especially given
continued commodity inflation and our other headwinds in the quarter such as the Brazil transportation strike.
In the quarter, organic revenue growth accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. The majority of our businesses performed very well with
particularly strong performances by Frito-Lay North America and each of the international sectors. And NAB, North American Beverages, posted
another quarter of sequential improvement in both organic revenue and operating profit performance.
Frito-Lay North America delivered balanced volume growth and net price realization, driven by great marketplace execution, innovation and
creative brand marketing. For example, to address consumers' desire for greater flavor and product variety in single-serve multi-packs, we launched
a 20-count family fun mix that include an array of products from Lay's to Cheetos to RUFFLES with an expanded mix of flavors, and this clearly
helped drive 10% net revenue growth in our overall variety pack business.
We launched RUFFLES Mozzarella 'n Marinara, our latest bar food-inspired flavor, to meet the expectations of existing fans and capture the attention
of new consumers seeking a unique and fun flavor experience, and this contributed to RUFFLES' 10% net revenue growth in the quarter.
And Doritos Blaze launched earlier this year with the most talked-about Super Bowl ad continues to perform well above our initial expectations
and contributed to 6% net revenue growth in trademark Doritos in Q2.
So overall, we are feeling very good about Frito-Lay North America's performance and momentum.
Turning to North American Beverages. The marketplace remains highly dynamic, but generally rational. With this as a backdrop, we're encouraged
by the trending improvement in both net revenue and operating profit performance. After a slow start in the earlier part of the second quarter,
both for the category and North American Beverages, we saw momentum improve and a return to net revenue growth in the back half of Q2.
Within the business, trademark Pepsi continued to make progress towards more stable performance. As we mentioned last quarter, we have
stepped up media support on trademark Pepsi under the Pepsi Generations campaign. As a result, in the second quarter, we began to see
improvements in a number of key brand health metrics that is leading to better net revenue performance as the year progresses.
So we intend to stay the course, increasing investment behind brand support in the second half of the year with the aim of driving further top line
improvement. At the same time, we remain laser focused on higher-growth categories with appropriate brand investment and robust innovation.
For example, bubly, a cleverly marketed new entrant in the fast-growing sparkling water segment launched earlier this year and it continues to
perform exceedingly well. Gatorade Zero, our latest hydration innovation with 0 sugar and all the electrolytes of Gatorade just launched and is off
to a great start. More importantly, trends on overall Gatorade performance have also recently accelerated. And we're excited about the return of
Mountain Dew Baja Blast, our summer limited time offer that just hit the shelves.

Client Id: 77
So overall, we have seen sequential quarterly improvement at NAB and we expect to see continued acceleration in top line performance in the
third quarter.
At Quaker Foods North America, our hot cereal business posted its fourth consecutive quarter of market share gains and delivered mid-single-digit
retail sales growth supported by our new ad campaign highlighting the functional benefits of oatmeal. In addition, Quaker light snacks had
double-digit retail sales growth and our Aunt Jemima pancake business grew both retail sales and market share for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Turning now to our sectors outside of North America. We are pleased with the more than 6% organic revenue growth we saw in our developing
and emerging market as a group. Strong marketplace execution, combined with stable macro conditions, have led to continued solid growth
across many of our key international markets though growth was negatively impacted by the 11-day transportation strike that broadly disrupted
commerce in Brazil.
Within Latin America, organic revenue grew 3.5%, driven by mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and double-digit growth in Argentina and Colombia.
We estimate the Brazil strike depressed overall net revenue growth for Latin America by approximately 2 percentage points.
In our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa sector, Russia, Poland and South Africa each grew organic revenue high single digits and Turkey had double-digit
organic revenue growth. Even within the developed markets of Europe, we saw mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the U.K. and high
single-digit growth in France.
And in AMENA, we had strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China and Egypt, high single-digit organic revenue growth in Pakistan and
Australia and solid mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in India.
This strong top line performance translated into impressive bottom line results with core constant currency operating profit up 12% in our
international divisions as a group, fueled by fundamental operating performance and the gain this year from the Thailand refranchising partially
offset by lapping the gain from our sale of Britvic shares in 2017.
The international results are in part reflection of our efforts to increasingly lift and shift successful initiatives from one market to many and innovating
on our big global brands in locally relevant ways. For instance, in Latin America, we are innovating with Quaker super foods, a new premium
platform with differentiated ingredients such as oats with rye, amaranth, flaxseed and quinoa. In ESSA, we have lifted and shifted Off the Eaten
Path, a premium range of plant-based snacks from the U.S. to the United Kingdom. And in AMENA, we have taken our successful Sunbites platform
from the U.S. to Australia by launching Sunbites Grain Waves Plus with the goodness of Australian whole grain corn, wheat and oats plus beetroot
and sweet potato. At the same time, we have also launched in the U.S. Red Rock Deli, one of our most successful brands in Australia.
Net, we're encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across many of our key international markets, NAB is making steady improvement and
Frito-Lay North America is performing well. Importantly, as we manage the business for strong performance today, we're also taking steps to enable
it to continue to perform well in the decades ahead. We are pleased to report that in the coming days we will publish our most recent sustainability
report, discussing our progress against and commitments to our sustainability goals. We encourage you to read the full report, but I'd like to take
just a few minutes this morning to provide you with the highlights.
We are in millions of pantries and refrigerators worldwide, so we know have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to use our scale to make
a positive impact on the world. Our customers, employees and partners feel good knowing that we're in a shared journey of sustainable transformation,
making our products more nutritious and more resource-efficient, dialing up the taste while reducing our environmental footprint. Our investors
can feel good knowing this makes us a stronger business over the long term, that we can also do well by also doing good.
12 years ago, we embarked on a journey at PepsiCo, that we call Performance with Purpose. Since then, much has changed at PepsiCo and around
the world, but the underlying principles behind Performance with Purpose remain. Much of our early work on Performance with Purpose required
us to think differently about our business and make the kinds of long-term investments from researching and developing new, more nutritious
products to finding ways to reduce water and energy use across plants and farms that will help us deliver on the vision of making our growth, our
operations and our impact more sustainable.

Client Id: 77
Sustainability has been defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs. Over the last dozen years, we have tried to meet the needs of the present while strengthening the ability of future generations to meet
theirs, integrating that aspiration into our goals for products, planet and people.
Let me briefly comment on each. When it comes to products, we've built on our legacy as the first company to voluntarily remove trans fats from
our snacks while reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in many of our products; launching a revolutionary nutrition-focused vending
option, Hello Goodness; and growing our portfolio of what we define as Good-for-You and Better for You options from about 38% of revenue in
2006 to roughly 50% last year.
We also teamed up with others in our industry to form the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation, removing 6.4 trillion calories from our food
and beverage products, surpassing our collective pledge by more than 400%. And through Food for Good, we have provided 80 million nutritious
servings to low-income U.S. families since 2009.
Regarding planet, we have raised the bar for what it means to be a responsible corporate water steward, earning the prestigious Stockholm Industry
Water Award. We've invested more than $40 million since 2006 to provide safe water access around the world, benefiting nearly 16 million people
in some of the planet's most water-stressed regions. We've also made our delivery fleet more energy-efficient, eliminating the need for over 1
million gallons of diesel fuel since our electric vehicle initiative began in 2010, the equivalent of keeping more than 2,000 passenger cars off the
road for a year while also making our beverage coolers and vending machines 60% more energy efficient.
And we're one of the world's largest purchasers of recycled PET. In fact, if more recycled PET were available, we would buy it. We've also launched
the first 100% compostable chip bag in test markets while diverting more and more of our waste from landfill, approximately 95% as of 2017.
And for people, we have reimagined what it means to support our associates from [ushering] onsite and near-site childcare campuses around the
world to expanding PepsiCo University's online course offerings to help associates upgrade their skills to navigate a rapidly changing world. We've
also helped lift up the communities we serve, playing a critical role in disaster relief efforts from Texas to Florida and Puerto Rico, Mexico to Ecuador
and China to the Philippines.
While we still have work to do in certain areas, we're incredibly proud of the progress we've made. Our aspiration of being a good company, good
ethically and good commercially continues to come to fruition yielding a broader, more lasting impact than we ever imagined and setting a standard
that companies across our industry and beyond aspire to meet.
Looking ahead, we will continue viewing our work through both a microscope and a telescope, focusing on the most granular details, grams of
saturated fat, parts per billion of greenhouse gas, the number of women in management roles as well as the larger ambition of building a business
that acts in accordance with our values, each of us striving to do what's right for the company and what is right for our communities because at
the end of the day, there is no separating the two.
With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I'll just provide a quick update on the outlook and then we'll move to your questions.
From a macro perspective, we maintain a fairly positive view overall. However, within this broadly positive picture, there remains risk of volatility
both in geographic markets as we saw in Brazil in the most recent quarter and in currencies as witnessed by the recent sharp rise in the strength
of the U.S. dollar.
From an industry standpoint, we continue to see pretty challenging conditions, including a dynamic retail and consumer landscape, a very
competitive environment and ongoing commodity inflation.

JULY 10, 2018 / 11:45AM, PEP - Q2 2018 PepsiCo Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
So putting this all together and considering our year-to-date performance, our guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. Specifically, we expect
organic revenue growth at least in line with our 2017 growth rate or 2.3%.
As we move through the year, our expectation is that we will continue to see some levels of gross margin compression from inflationary input
costs. Normally, you would expect to see the gross margin contraction offset with SG&A productivity. But as we have stated previously, with the
benefit of a lower effective tax rate in 2018, we are making investments to fortify the business as well as having funded the U.S. frontline bonus
and these investments will largely offset productivity-driven margin improvement.
We expect our core effective tax rate to be in the low 20s.
And we expect core earnings per share of $5.70 or a 9% increase compared to 2017 core earnings per share of $5.23.
We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and to exercise disciplined capital allocation with prudent reinvestment into the business. For
2018, we continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which includes approximately $9 billion in cash flow from operations,
including a $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, and net capital spending of approximately $3.6 billion.
We continue to expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders in 2018 with cash dividends of approximately $5 billion, reflecting a 15%
increase in the annualized dividend per share that began with the June payment and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
Finally, as you update your models, I'd like to highlight the following. We expect our rate of earnings growth to be substantially higher in the fourth
than in the third quarter. This is due to the timing of investments and the laps associated with last year's natural disasters.
In addition, we expect the previously announced refranchising of our Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia business operations to benefit our
fourth quarter earnings.
And finally, based on market consensus forecast, we expect foreign exchange translation to negatively impact both net revenue and operating
profit in the second half of the year, reversing the ForEx benefits that we had in the first half.
With that, operator, we're ready to take the first question.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
So Indra, clearly there's been a lot of investor focus around the number of pressure points in the CPG industry in terms of pricing power, brand
demand fragmentation, et cetera, et cetera, and basically that some of the traditional advantages of larger CPG companies are breaking down. In
that context, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on if there are areas of significant investment or operational changes at Pepsi going
forward beyond what you've already done to help position the company versus some of those industry challenges and how realistic a long-term,
high single-digit earnings growth algorithm beyond 2018 is if you need to reinvest against some of those pressure points? And within that answer,
I was hoping specifically you could touch on price/mix. You've obviously had strong pricing realization the last few years with the inflationary
commodities and the trade and tariff risk. I'd love some updated thoughts on price/mix also within that.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Thanks, Dara. And first of all, I think you asked me about 10 questions within 1 question. But given that we had this technical difficulty, I guess
you're entitled to ask these 10 questions. I think you asked a set of very, very interesting questions. I think the changes we are seeing in the industry
are quite interesting. And I think the changes that we are seeing benefit companies that have already invested to build scale, build an international
footprint and have the right partnerships around the world. I think now is not the time for companies to go and plant flags in new countries and
try to start up businesses. So I actually observed that the advantaged CPG companies are small, niche, single-country companies with small brands
who grow to a certain level and then flip it or very large, established scale companies who built businesses in multiple geographies. And I don't
mean just planting the flag, actually built scale. And I think PepsiCo is one of those few companies that have actually, over the years, invested to
build scale, put the right partnerships in place, built a diversified portfolio and actually solidified our presence and we made all the investments
over the years. So that part of the investment is behind us. This next tranche of investments relate to digitalization, thinking through more automation
in our plants, in our go-to-market systems figuring out how we can unleash more productivity, but more efficiency and effectiveness, not just
efficiency, efficiency and effectiveness, so that we can serve the changing retail world in more efficient and productive ways. Because retailers are
going to go through their own changes. And they're going to look at a few players to be the anchor suppliers to them while they handle with all
kinds of changes with a large portion of the CPG world. And I think PepsiCo with its DSD systems and with its high-velocity categories, its brand
portfolio, and most importantly, innovation becomes a very valuable partner across the world. I mean, I've often said this to you, when we had just
snacks or beverages going to large European retailers, we were like 37 or #50 on the list. Now with our combined approach and our Power of One
approach, we're in the top 5 or top 7 suppliers driving a lot of the growth. So they look at us and say there are these large companies that drive a
lot of growth in our anchor suppliers that we should just have great relationships with, leave them aside while we focus on all the other players
that we need to either prune the portfolio or figure out how to make them more efficient. So we're making investments in digitalization, more
automation in plants, rethinking our innovation process and making sure that we fragment -- or segment our innovation between premium, mid
and value and deal with each country and each marketplace with that sort of an architecture. And then we're getting better and better at lifting
and shifting across the world. So Dara, I don't think there are big bursts of innovation required. All that we are doing is investing as we go along.
And I think Hugh talked about the fact that we've been making investments in the business. We've been doing that deliberately and carefully over
the years. And we're going to continue to do that. We're going to look for ways to unleash productivity. And every time we have productivity, we're
going to see how we judiciously reinvest in the business so that we can keep this engine going. And in terms of price/mix, innovation is a big driver
of price/mix as is revenue management. And we're improving our revenue management skills all the time, applying more digital tools. When it
comes to innovation, we are thinking more and more about segmenting our innovation. And we're also thinking about how to incubate a niche
company within our big company and that's what we are focused on in every big region of the world. So overall, we feel very comfortable with
our overall strategy.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Faria Teixeira - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
So I appreciate your answer to Dara, but I was hoping if you can update us on your outlook for NAB since the last call as you are considering strategic
alternatives [in the light] of this combined approach with technology you just mentioned using the [OTN] example. I would appreciate if you can
elaborate.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
I'll provide some opening comments, Andrea, and toss to Hugh to give more color. What we told you in the last call is that you should expect to
see sequential improvement in North American Beverage performance. That's exactly what we are focused on and that's what we're delivering.
Every part of the business in North American Beverages is showing sequential improvement. In the second part of Q2, we saw significant improvement
in performance, and as we go into Q3, we feel good about the trend rate. We are playing a very responsible game in terms of advertising and
pricing. And with commodity inflation, we will continue to play a responsible -- take a responsible position in this marketplace by pushing through
pricing. So at the end of the day, our North American Beverage business, which participates in a highly competitive category, needs to be managed
very, very carefully especially at a time when there are changes in the marketplace from lots of competitive activity. And look, there's always going
to be short-term [reservations] when competitors go through major changes in their business models. Our challenge is to maintain a very steady
hand and make the PepsiCo portfolio work for us, and that's what we've been doing. I don't know, Hugh, if you want to add anything to this.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
The only thing I would add, Andrea, is hopefully you all have seen that this management team is always focused on creating value both in the short
term and in the long term and achieving the right balance between the two. And as we look at all of the businesses, that is our most significant
focus and I think we will continue to do that just as we have.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.
Pablo Ernesto Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Look, 2 quick questions. One, I understand that you're reinvesting [overall] the tax benefits, but can you clarify whether that's more heavily geared
to reinvesting in beverages? Or is it pretty much evenly across the business? And the second question, which is related to that, when you see a
success that Coca-Cola has had with the Diet Coke new products and with a Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, any thoughts in terms of how things will be
done different on the Pepsi side of things? And the reason I ask that is that if the brands themselves haven't been improved in terms of innovation,
how much is reinvestment in more marketing going to help?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Pablo, we reinvested tax benefits in additional media for NAB and wherever the businesses needed investment, we put it in. The idea is not just to
invest, it's to reinvest judiciously so that we get a return from the investments. And we also reinvested some of the tax benefits in our frontline
bonus, so that especially people in the United States where the tax benefits really accrued can benefit from the upside. Now when it comes to our
North American Beverage business, we are investing in CSDs, especially trademark Pepsi. And we're investing more in trademark Pepsi because
we saw a stepped up investments in media from our competition, so we're doing that. When it comes to the Zero Sugar portfolio, both between

Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar, Pepsi Zero Sugar is growing extremely well, extremely well. I mean, it's a -- I hate to use the word flying off the
shelves, but it's doing exceedingly well. When it comes to Diet Pepsi, Diet Pepsi is also back to good performance. And I have to tell you, the flavor
portfolio on Diet Pepsi and whatever competition launched, you might want to look at the numbers in a little bit more detail because I think it's a
mixed bag. We have to be careful not to draw too much innovation to this marketplace and sort of obfuscate the numbers. From our perspective,
our Zero Sugar portfolio between Diet and Zero Sugar, is doing well and is doing well on a sustained, consistent basis. And we are playing the long
game, Pablo, in terms of overall liquid refreshment beverages. And we think that, that's the right way to play this beverage game and we feel good
about where we are headed.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Hugh, I just wanted to pick up on you made a comment in terms of the forward guidance about gross margin still being under pressure in second
half. So I guess, a couple questions. I guess that implies we should expect that gross margins might be down in the second half and then maybe
what some of the pressure points are, what sort of inflation and I guess also maybe transactional FX. If you could just kind of walk us through what's
going to drive that pressure in gross margins in the second half and maybe what mitigation you might have as we look forward into '19?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Bryan, happy to do that. So a couple comments. When I say gross margins under pressure, I'm talking about relatively nominal pressure as
we've seen over the last several quarters. A combination of a couple of factors on gross margin: number one, obviously commodity inflation has
picked up a bit. Certainly, we've seen a bit more in oil, and in addition to that, in aluminum. Second, transport costs have also been under some
pressure with the driver shortage in the United States. And then, third, in international markets, as you know, where we have seen some inflation,
we do tend to price a bit behind inflation and try to drive productivity in order to offset that. And then, obviously, we're reinvesting the tax benefit
in the form of new capabilities, so you don't see the productivity flow through as you normally might in SG&A. So those are the several factors that
are driving it. Overall, as I said, we expect full year to be on the 9% that we originally committed to and we're balancing the internal workings of
the P&L to make that happen.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - SVP and Senior Analyst
So just wanted to ask a little bit more about the sustainability of your results going forward along 3 dimensions. First is the sustainability of onetimers,
like Thailand and Britvic and coming up on Czech Republic here in your core results. Should we continue to expect things like that to be a consistent
part of your algorithm going forward? How much more of those types of things you have to sell? Second, in terms of pricing, it continues to be a
big driver obviously for Latin America and you're willing to continue to sacrifice a little bit of volume there again. How much longer do you think
that's sustainable? And then, third, on NAB improvements, very pleased that they're on track, both you and I. If you can give us more about whether
you believe that was actually driven by advertising increases? Was there an advertising increase in particular in NAB overall as opposed to just Pepsi
because you called out Pepsi, but I don't see it in the release for the segment NAB. Or is there something else that drove that improvement? And
so will that improvement you guys believe continue not just going through this quarter, but going forward?

JULY 10, 2018 / 11:45AM, PEP - Q2 2018 PepsiCo Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
I'm going to take the third one and then, Hugh, I'm going to toss it to you to talk about the first 2, okay? NAB improvement, again, Ali, as I mentioned,
we are playing the LRB game. We are looking to improve our position in the liquid refreshment beverage category because we play in pretty much
every category in LRB, most of them, but very, very strong brands. And in terms of A&M spending, we increased A&M spending on trademark Pepsi
as we mentioned we were going to do. And because the A&M gets [curved in], you'll see the benefits flowing through in Q3 and Q4 more as we
go through. And we are seeing the improvement in brand health metrics and we are seeing a sequential improvement in the performance of the
business. So believe me, we are focused maniacally on tracking the performance and the results of all of our increased spending. And what we're
seeing in the results that gives us confidence to tell you what we told you on the call today. So on balance, we are feeling good about the NAB
performance trends. Now let me turn it to Hugh to talk about the onetimers and pricing, especially in countries like -- regions like Latin America.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, happy to, Ali. In terms of onetimers, if you look at our record over the last 4 or 5 years, we've always had some onetimers in whether it's
refranchising of businesses or sales of businesses or assets. So that's going to continue to be a factor as it has been. In terms of Latin America,
without a doubt, where you have high-inflation environments, we've tended to price through the vast majority of that inflation, and as a result, it's
improved our revenue results, sometimes at the expense of volume. As you see the inflation rates come down in those countries, obviously our
pricing will diminish, but we do expect that our volume will pick up as a result of that. And we expect to continue to see strong results out of Latin
America and other places that have historically had high inflation where the numbers have come down a bit.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
I think the most important thing on onetimers, Hugh, we don't do onetimers to deliver earnings. We do onetimers because we think it's the right
business model for those countries. And what we're trying to do is to strengthen the core business so that we have the right partner to boost the
performance of the beverage business in certain markets, we'll franchise it to them. And if we think we are better off operating it, we'll do that. So
I think we use onetimers in a very judicious, strategic way to improve the overall performance of the company.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Eunjoo Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD, Senior Analyst & Co-Head of the GIR Asian Professionals Network
So Indra, I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the Gatorade performance. Trends have gotten a little bit better recently. The comps
are getting easier, so maybe that's also helping. But just wanted to also get a better sense of maybe some of the brand health metrics that you
talked about as really to -- maybe that was, I think, more of a Pepsi trademark comment, but on Gatorade specifically. And then as you think about
Gatorade Zero, a little bit more color just in terms of the positioning of that particular line and how much marketing investments that you're making
on that line?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Gatorade is actually doing very well and whether it's helping, for sure, but the underlying Gatorade trademark is very, very strong. And Gatorade
always attracts new players into the marketplace and they come in with either lower prices or they try to come in and build distribution and they
might take a few share points in any quarter or two. But then, over time, if you look at it over a period of 5 or 7 years, the Gatorade franchise has
been extremely resilient and has basically held onto its leadership position. We've innovated to build shoulders with the Gatorade recovery drinks,
the Gatorade Chews before you start exercising and then we have segmented along flavors and then across different sports. Many of our consumers
wanted a Gatorade Zero for the light exerciser who didn't want the carbohydrates that real athletes needed. And so we launched Gatorade Zero.

Even though there's Propel also, they wanted to be seen with a Gatorade, so we launched Gatorade Zero. And we keep advertising along the entire
trademark. And we have never wavered from advertising to athletes and to active exercisers and that's going to be a continuous focus of Gatorade.
It's a very strong, resilient franchise and we feel good about where it is and where it's headed.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I was curious you had mentioned sort of 2 different types of comments around brands and innovation. So one bucket was sort of the discussion
of lift and shift continuing to support and build your biggest franchises. And then, Indra, you also mentioned the idea of incubating niche brands
or companies within market. So was curious if you could kind of put those 2 together, and in particular, what I've been most curious about is how
PepsiCo is thinking about a small brand strategy if you want or need to have one in the beverage business? Because when I look at some of the
work you've done in the last 2 years, LIFEWTR, bubly, it's very much a strategy of drive a blockbuster win, not build something slowly and patiently
through single serve and discovery. So I was curious your thoughts around the viability of a small brand strategy within PepsiCo and if that was
something you were focusing on?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
It's actually a great question, Lauren. Actually, if I look back especially the last 5 years of beverages, we've had some spectacular new products,
which for any small startup company would have been a blockbuster. But for PepsiCo, because we put it through DSD system, unless it reaches a
scale of a LIFEWTR or bubly in the first 12 to 18 months, we can't support it because many times the space has to come out of the core cooler or
the core aisle. And so we look at differential velocities and then the DSD system tends to kill it. And if I look at products like Lemon Lemon from
last year, it was rated the best new product launch of last year. It reached a pretty impressive level of sales, yet on the DSD system it didn't do that
well because it was cannibalizing space from a core CSD category. So what we have created now is this new entity within PepsiCo called The Hive.
It's a separate group. Just like we did with the e-commerce, we've taken it out of the core headquarter. It's going to be an entrepreneurial group
that's going to take some of the best new products that we launched and reached a certain size, but we never really allowed it to thrive in the DSD
system. We will nurture it and incubate it in whatever distribution system they think is the best for it. And when it reaches a certain size, we can
decide whether it should come into the DSD system or not. And this group is also going to look at other venturing brands they can bring in. And
we want to create an environment where we have a business within a business, a small entrepreneurial sort of agile group that's thinking about
the new age consumer that loves discovery brands while allowing the big brands to thrive in the overall mother ship. This is not new to PepsiCo
North America. We are doing something like this in Europe also. It's a very local business, so we have to be careful not to make it global. It's a very
local business. And we're going to play with these businesses because there is a consumer that is willing to pay for discovery brands and they can
reach a decent level of growth. And so we're going to go off and see how to make it happen. We're feeling excited about what we've just launched.
Let's see what happens the next few months and years.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
So going back to North American Beverages for a minute. It does indeed look like we're on track for a return to growth in the second half, which is
great. I'd just love a little bit more context about what you might feel are the top success factors in that path, whether it's key launch like Gatorade
Zero, better realized price/mix as inflation builds more of an inflection in core Pepsi or just are there 1 or 2 priorities on your scorecard that you
could call out for us, that'd be great. And then, secondly, as you've been open about your ongoing assessment of strategic options for the bottling

utility, as you called it, whether that's constituting a stand-alone entity or putting it in the hands of multiple franchisees or keeping it as part of
PepsiCo, I'm just curious as to whether or not you've narrowed in on any subset of those options? Or what the time frame might be for you being
in a position to communicate your path forward to the market?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, Steve, happy to answer those questions. First, in terms of the priorities, if nothing else, what we saw last year and we've certainly seen in this
year, we need to be able to both make sure the big businesses are on track in North America Beverages. Those big businesses obviously are Pepsi,
Mountain Dew and Gatorade. What we've seen over the last couple of quarters is certainly a strengthening in the Mountain Dew business, both
the core green bottle business as well as the innovation with Ice and now the return of Baja Blast, which has always been a Mountain Dew fan
favorite. Second obviously is Gatorade. Gatorade certainly is a business that's now back on track and we're very excited about the innovation.
Gatorade Zero really meets, I think, a very unmet need for the lapsed Gatorade user because, as Indra pointed out earlier, they just don't want the
calories, but they want the Gatorade brand. And then Pepsi where we knew we needed to increase the advertising. We knew we needed to have
a good campaign this year. That obviously takes longer to do. The quantity is easier to turn on, but just getting into consumers' minds takes a
period of time. So first sort of big priority is making sure the big businesses are doing well. Second is continue to execute against the innovations
in the newer categories, whether it's bubly or continuing to execute LIFEWTR or continuing to make sure newer brands like KeVita do well. That's
the additive that sort of creates the growth in the business. The core brands grow at a certain rate, and all of those new innovations create the
incremental growth. So I think we need to be able to do both. North America Beverage is obviously of big, nuanced, complex business and we
need to do more than 1 or 2 things well, we need to do most things well for that business to perform and that's what you see happening. Regarding
strategic options, nothing new to report on that. We'll continue to look at options to create value not only in that business, but across all of our
businesses.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Lee Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Beverage and Tobacco Analyst
So I just wanted to talk about Frito-Lay North America. Your growth really has been impressive both on the top and bottom line. So how sustainable
is this from a long-term perspective? And then could you guys walk through for us any productivity initiatives that you've specifically implemented
in Frito-Lay that you possibly could implement across the rest of your businesses?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
I mean, Frito-Lay, the reason the growth is impressive is because Frito-Lay plays in salty snacks and the entire macro snack space is there for the
taking. And so Frito-Lay focuses on the core and then inches out of the core by taking occasions from the rest of macro snacks. And the innovation
engine is very geared to going out and building both frequency and penetration and picking up more and more snacking occasions. And as long
as they keep doing that, they should be able to deliver the growth. The DSD apparatus is an extremely impressive machine and that actually helps
sustain Frito-Lay's growth. In terms of productivity initiatives, we've talked about GES, Bonnie. GES is now rolling out to multiple locations. It's doing
2 things: one is delivering more productivity, but more importantly, it's debottlenecking the system because it's allowing us to put more SKUs and
be more customer-specific in our picking. And so GES has actually been a big benefit for us. And then deploying more digital technologies across
Frito-Lay is actually delivering more productivity. The good news is as North America -- tools that North American Beverages develops goes to
Frito-Lay and what Frito-Lay develops comes to North America. And so we have a wonderful transfer of knowledge and tests that's happening

between the 2 businesses. And so we can take the customer base, both traditional trades -- up and down the street and big organized accounts
and figure out how to serve them better, whether you call it geo box at our beverage business so GES and Frito-Lay, there's a lot of information
exchange going on. And overall, I think both businesses are high-velocity businesses and they're able to unleash productivity to reinvest to keep
this growth engine going. Do you want to add anything, Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
No, I think you've captured it very well.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst
Indra, a quick clarification. You did say you expect to take pricing in NAB CSDs. Can you talk about how quickly we should expect you to roll out
pricing and to what extent? And then another one, gas prices are now a multiyear high. Are you seeing any change in consumer behavior especially
in the c-store channel?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. To answer your first question first, I think you'll see incremental pricing benefit in the third quarter and then you'll see more in the fourth
quarter. Regarding gas prices, convenience channel was up about 3%, I believe, overall for the second quarter. So I think given the healthiness of
the overall economy, that's more than offsetting the gas price increases.

Hugh, just for you. On CapEx, could you remind us why the $3.6 billion is higher than it's been historically and how representative you think that
is of future CapEx either in absolute terms or relative to sales?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So our previously discussed long-term guidance is equal to or less than 5% of net revenue. No update on that right now. Bigger investments
in a couple of places. Latin America, we've seen capital spending go up as we've implemented some of the GES solutions that Indra has mentioned
on the previous question. Number two, we're investing more in Frito-Lay because we're identifying projects to drive continued growth and
productivity. And number three, North America Beverage, as the single-serve strategy has continued to be successful, we're adding capacity in
certain places.

Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Head of Global Beverages Research
Indra, in the past, you've given us a little bit more color in terms of market share gains and value share gains and clearly you're doing very well
outside of the U.S. Can you perhaps give us a little bit of sense of where you're gaining share in important international markets and where things
are more challenging? And then, secondly, bubly, off to a great start. Perhaps if you could maybe stand back a little bit and give us a sense of where
you see yourself taking your water strategy and what percentage of the business it is right now.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
In terms of share gains internationally, I think overall salty snacks globally, I think, in 75% of the markets we are holding or gaining share. Remember,
internationally, we also have a lot of local low-cost competitors. In spite of that, I think 70%, 75% of the markets we hold or gain share. I think in
60% of the markets, we're gaining share. In about 75%, we either hold or gain. I'm giving you rough numbers, Robert. In terms of beverages, again,
in many of the markets that we participate, as PepsiCo, about 50% or 60% of the markets, we're actually holding or gaining share. Then the other
markets, we go in and out. One quarter, we may gain share. One quarter, local competitor or a global competitor may gain share. So we trade
shares on a quarterly basis based on what we are lapping or what specific blockbuster marketing initiative is being implemented at that time. But
overall, what we are focused on is, on an annual basis, how do we make sure that we don't do anything crazy just to gain share. We participate in
a very responsible way. And somewhere between 60% and 75% of our markets, if we can hold or gain share, that's a very sustainable, deliberate
strategy. And that's really what we are focused on globally both the snacks and beverages and now more and more in our nutrition businesses,
which we are trying to figure out what the relevant marketplace is and how do we calculate a fair market share number. So that's, roughly speaking,
where we are on share.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
On water, Indra, just I'll finish Robert's question. It's about 12% of our volume, Robert, round numbers. And in terms of water strategy, obviously
we have a case pack water business that provides baseload volume and then we are increasingly segmenting that business, whether it be with
flavored still waters, whether it be with flavored sparkling waters in the form of bubly, whether it be in the form of LIFEWTR, which obviously appeals
to a large consumer segment and one that continues to grow well for us. So I think you'll continue to see us segment the water category into
profitable niches to go along with the large-scale case pack water businesses.

Sunil Harshad Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD of Tobacco, Household Products and Beverages
So Indra, I was hoping you can provide some of the logic behind the various refranchising initiatives PepsiCo has undertaken in the international
markets and how any early learnings could inform the beverage strategy in the U.S. and I guess the main question is, is it even translatable, that
would be really helpful to understand.
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Nik, I'd tell you that's a good question and let me just offer some points. When we refranchise, it's usually to somebody who already has a portfolio
of beverages. Because Pepsi internationally, in many markets, we don't have a full lineup of beverages. We participate only in a small lineup. We
partner with somebody who has their own LRB products and together we cover the entire line. An example would be something like a Postobón
in Colombia that has their own line of noncarbs. And then we come in with our portfolio, and together, we have a fantastic leadership position in
Colombia. What we are looking at, and Hugh talked about our Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia beverage operations, we're refranchising it

to a partner who already has a lineup of LRB and we complete the portfolio. So our system actually is much more robust than people realize because,
as a system, we are much stronger than just PepsiCo in the international beverage business and that's why we feel good about the beverage
business. And the early learnings are make sure if you're going to refranchise, refranchise to somebody who knows how to run the beverage
business and they have a portfolio that, together, the 1 plus 1 is a 3 not detracting from our own performance. So that's all we are going to focus
on going forward and those are the learnings from our beverage refranchising.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.
William Bates Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD
Question on just the momentum on NAB that you talked about as it's kind of started slow and had good momentum at the end. I mean, that tracks
with kind of what we saw in North America weather in terms of cold and wet late March, April, early May and then came back roaring and then
very hot. So trying to understand what you see that makes you feel that it's beyond weather, I mean, lifting the whole category? Are you seeing
kind of market share? Especially in CSDs, are you seeing something stabilize? Or what gives you so much confidence that carry through as we get
to kind of more normal weather, albeit easier comps in the back half?
Indra K. Nooyi - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman of the Board & CEO
Weather is clearly a factor. I mean, I would be lying if I didn't tell you that hot weather helps the beverage business. But I think on top of that, our
brand health metrics are all trending the right way. The business is trending the right way. And pretty much all of our franchises we are seeing
sequential improvement in performance. And so even businesses that had difficult laps we are seeing sequential improvement in performance.
So I think if this continues, this bodes well for NAB.
So thank you all for your questions. Let me summarize. The business overall is performing well in a highly dynamic environment, and we remain
on track to deliver our financial goals for the year. We remain highly focused on driving better operating profit from North American Beverages
and we're encouraged by the sequential improvement we've seen in NAB.
Just as important, even as we remain highly focused on performing well in the current and coming quarters, we remain committed to continuing
to transform the business to strengthen its sustainability and durability to perform well far into the future. Thank you for joining us this morning,
and thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Thank you.

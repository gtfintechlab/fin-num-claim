Welcome everyone, and thanks for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call.
I am pleased to announce that the team here at MercadoLibre delivered another quarter of strong growth in 
our commerce and fintech businesses in Q2 2021, achieving record levels in both volume and revenues. This 
strong performance builds on the solid first quarter we had this year. We believe that our business is showing 
tremendous momentum despite immense volatility in our key markets due to the frequent closing of physical 
retail across Latin America. I am proud to see the consistent execution of our plans while prioritizing 
innovation, speed of execution and user experience, all elements that are at the core of our corporate DNA. 
As hopefully the region, and the world, prepare for a return to a post pandemic reality, we see Latin America 
with enormous potential for continued growth in digital services. The last 18 months have generated a step 
function increase in digitalization of commerce and finance, setting the stage for sustained long term growth 
throughout the region. In its latest 2021 report, eMarketer has pointed to Latin America as the leading region 
in the world for ecommerce sales growth, with almost 10 percentage points higher projections than the 
worldwide average. Additionally, three of our top markets, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, were listed among 
the top 5 growth markets globally. To deliver on that opportunity, we maintain our focus on executing our 
strategic plan, as we have until now.
Taking a more short term look, as the region re-opens, our businesses are scheduled to face tougher 
comparable growth rates as we fully lap 2020’s surge. The data so far is encouraging, as it seems to point 
to consumer behaviour shifts towards online purchasing having staying power. This preliminary optimism 
can be quantified in the two year growth stacks for Total Payments Volume on a consolidated, FX-neutral 
basis, which have accelerated from around mid 140% in Q1’21 pre-pandemic, to nearly 200% this past 
quarter as economies re-open. We will continue to observe these trends for the second half of the year, as 
more reopenings occur across Latin America.

With those opening remarks, let me now begin our quarterly review with an update of our Commerce 
business during the second quarter. For the quarter, the first that compares against a prior year fully affected 
by a surge in demand for e-commerce driven by lockdowns, consolidated gross merchandise volume grew 
46% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, reaching over $7 billion dollars. This represents an increase of 
almost $1 billion dollars sequentially. We sold almost 245 million items in Q2, a growth of 37% year-overyear. We also saw improvements in the level of transactions per buyer compared to historic marks, a sign 
that we are sequentially driving increased engagement by our users. This quarter we reached a record of 
37,8 million unique buyers on our commerce platform alone. 
At the segment level, we experienced strong growth in our key geographies. Brazil grew over 40% on an FX 
neutral basis versus the prior year in GMV, with over 125 million items sold this quarter. Argentina continues 
to post strong GMV growth, reaching over 60% year-over-year, on an FX neutral basis, and with an all time 
high number of unique buyers. We are also pleased to see that Mexico, who has eased out of lockdown 
restrictions in Q2, having maintained the number of buyers that we attracted in Q1. This led to increasing 
the items sold year over year by 30% and growing 29% in GMV on an FX neutral basis during Q2. Finally, 
in Chile, where we have called out accelerated growth rates over the last two quarters, we are proud to have 
reached a growth of over 230% year over year on an FX neutral basis.
We continue to invest in product breadth and shopping convenience as drivers to attract and retain buyers. 
As a result of our commercial efforts to increase assortment with our current and newer sellers across key 
categories, we once again grew total live listings this quarter posting another record in selection availability. 
Beyond strengthening categories where we historically have a strong GMV, such as auto parts, home and 
industries, and consumer electronics, part of the surge in product depth comes from our continued expansion 
into consumer packaged goods and our supermarket experience. As an example, our recent partnerships 
with local physical food retailers, such as Grupo Pão de Açucar in Brazil, are off to a strong start. Buyer 
demand has surpassed our expectations and we began accelerating fulfillment operations to strengthen our 
category experience as we look forward to adding more partners for the category. These warehouses will 
also help our first-party inventory, which also plays an important role in complementing the product 
assortment from partners in this category.
We are also enthused about initiatives that will expand our assortment in Fashion and Apparel. We have 
dedicated product development teams working on recently implemented improvements to the search and 
navigation aspects of our site to facilitate discovery of items in these categories. Along those lines, apparel 
is a key category to be featured in our upcoming live streaming platform which we have already begun 
testing over the last few months. With the additions of loved fashion brands and retailers such as Grupo 
Restoque, Asics, Nike and the most recent announcement of our partnership with Grupo Arezzo, we believe 
we continue making important strides in this category. 
As markets gradually continue to reopen, we are directing our investments towards initiatives that will spur 
continued growth as well as user engagement and retention. So far this year, marketing investments have 
been geared towards stronger promotional events and increasing our coverage of orders with free shipping. 
We have also been driving branding campaigns to reinforce our brand’s connection with our users and 
merchants. We believe these investments solidify our brand’s trust as a marketplace for frequent purchases, 
and expect to continue ramping up investment levels during the second half of the year.
On the retention front, we are encouraged by the positive trends we have observed so far in terms of 
engagement through our loyalty program. The users on our loyalty programs premium levels continue to 
grow as our user base engages in a growing number of additional MELI services. For example, we see a 
consistent increase in users in video and audio content subscriptions that are offered at a discount for loyal 
users.

Along with these efforts in category development, we believe that these marketing and loyalty initiatives are 
crystalizing the online shopping habit formation within our marketplace. 
 
Let me now turn over to Mercado Envios, where we have consistently been delivering transformative change. 
This is another key area of investment that we believe to be driving a distinctive experience for buyers and 
sellers and underlying our sustained growth.
This quarter we shipped over 230 million items, reaching increasingly faster speeds and reduced unit shipping 
costs on a consolidated basis. We took another step towards boosting our managed network in Q2, reaching 
a penetration of 83% on a consolidated basis, advancing in all geographies where we operate with our 
logistics solutions. Fast delivery at an efficient cost is a key priority for us. To keep pushing our boundaries 
on this front during the second quarter we launched Same Day shipping deliveries from our Fulfillment 
centers in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile. In Brazil, with our current footprint, the same-day solution 
can reach almost 20% of national postal codes. 
Beyond our fulfillment operation, fast delivery is also made possible through our expanding cross docking 
network and our flex solution. Cross docking represented over 40% of shipments in Q2, leveraging our 
extensive network of pick-up and drop-off points throughout the region. Our Flex service, where we leverage 
the logistics capabilities of our existing merchants for same-day deliveries, is currently available in five major 
cities in Latin America and has a penetration of over 9% on our managed network. With all these adaptive 
logistics solutions, we saw sequential improvements in delivery times in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico this 
quarter, and on an aggregate level considering all shipping modalities and geographies our average delivery 
time is less than a day and a half. 
All these Envios initiatives led to the first quarter ever where over half of all purchases on MELI were delivered 
the same or next day, we believe this to be a remarkable achievement. We are excited about the great 
advances in Shipping we achieved over the last year, and there is still more to come as we take our logistics 
expertise to more geographies and cast a wider net in terms of free and same-day deliveries.
Let’s now review our performance for FinTech. 
During Q2, MercadoPago surpassed $17.5 billion dollars in total payment volume on a consolidated basis, 
growing 72% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year. This represented a total of almost 730 million 
transactions for the quarter, almost 100 million more compared to the first quarter of 2021 and growing 
80% year-over-year. 
Off platform, TPV grew by 94% compared to Q2’20, reaching $10.3 billion dollars. We were very pleased to 
see TPV rising both in B2B and B2C payment solutions.
Starting with the merchant solutions, we are particularly glad to see strong levels of TPV for Online Payments 
for the quarter. TPV for Online Payments grew 67% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis, with strong 
advances in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. We are expanding structurally into SME and longtail sellers through 
partnerships with other ecommerce platforms, for which we are the standard checkout option. In addition, 
the cross selling of online payment services into our mobile point of sale seller base has also been an 
important channel for adding merchants. 
For Point, our point-of-sale offering, we accelerated TPV growth in the second quarter, delivering 94% 
growth year over year on a consolidated, FX-neutral basis. This is the highest TPV growth rate booked for 
Point since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, even in the context of continued lockdowns throughout part 
of the region. Device sales are still booming, having reached a total of 1.1 million devices sold this quarter, 
and with a more premium device mix compared to prior periods. While Brazil continues to drive most of the

growth for Point, we also see consistent traction in Argentina and a rapidly scaling business in Mexico.
Turning now to B2C solutions, our Wallet business booked a total payment volume growth rate of 
107% on a consolidated, FX neutral basis. Our Wallet, as one of the features within our digital account, is 
showing multiple signs of improved engagement levels from users, growing 43% in amount of payments per 
user, as well as showing sustained growth in average transaction value. In addition, more Wallet users are 
keen on investing their savings in the MercadoPago digital account. For the second quarter we reached 
almost 19.3 million investment accounts, up from 11.4 million in Q2’2020 and 15.7 million in Q1’2021. 
Overall, our payments ecosystem has added and engaged more users in Q2, both payers and collectors, 
compared to the previous quarter. We reached over 39 million payers off-platform, with over 15 million 
payers just from the Wallet this quarter. On the collectors side, in Q2 we reached 13.6 million total offplatform sellers, a record for us, and up from 6.9 million during the same period last year. 
Over this wide and growing base of users, we are confident that we can continue to overlay financial services 
through the digital wallet such as insurance, debit cards, and, more immediately, access to credit loans, 
which I will now review in more detail.
Our Credit business grew significantly in Q2. We originated another record - over 700 million dollars 
in credit this quarter. This compares to 133 million in the same period last year. As such, we closed Q2 with 
our largest portfolio so far, reaching over 800 million dollars. We see strong and consistent growth from all 
three of our credit books: consumers, merchants online and merchants offline. 
Credits to consumers, in particular, are driving the most accelerated growth rates and now represents over 
50% of our current total portfolio. As an important channel for consumer credit, the ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ 
feature for payments within our Wallet has already reached double digit penetration rates in Brazil and 
Mexico. On the country level, we had the most significant uptick in originations coming from Mexico this 
quarter, and Brazil and Argentina continue to expand at impressive triple-digit growth rates. We have reached 
approximately 27 million consumers with approved credit lines in the region by this point, almost 9 times 
more than Q2 of last year.
After the temporary increase in NPLs we had experienced at the beginning of Q1 stemming primarily 
from government financial aid user cohorts, we have returned to overall healthy NPL profiles for our credit 
book in Q2 and feel confident to keep expanding our credit offering while managing healthy margins after 
loss provisions.
We also expanded the roll out of the MercadoPago proprietary hybrid, NFC enabled, card in Q2, issuing 
an additional 4.2 million cards, almost 3 million of which are in Brazil. Particularly in the month of June, we 
began to accelerate the credit card distribution and activation for some user cohorts, with many more yet to 
activate in the coming quarters. The early responses of our new credit card users are encouraging as they 
tend to have higher customer satisfaction with MercadoPago services overall and have been consistently 
increasing their credit card use frequency over these initial trial periods. 
We believe that the Credit business is foundational in our efforts to democratize access to money in 
Latin America. In a region with high indexes of unbanked and underbanked populations, demand for loans 
of all sizes and circumstances is rampant. Our extended marketplace from the commerce and the payments 
verticals gives us the infrastructure, expertise, and data to properly score, distribute and manage loans to a 
variety of profiles. 
With that, let’s now turn to our review of financial results for the second quarter.
I’ll start with the P&L. Following a strong first quarter in terms of revenues, we maintained strong traction 
in revenue growth and in Q2 we reached $1.7 billion dollars in net revenues on a consolidated basis, growing 
MERCADOLIBRE 2Q'21 EARNINGS

94% in US Dollars and 103% on an FX neutral basis. 
At the country level, on an FX neutral basis, Argentina grew 112% and Mexico 76%. In Brazil, on an FXneutral basis, we surpassed 100% growth in net revenues this quarter. In all key geographies there was a 
significant contribution to revenue growth from both commerce and fintech. 
For the quarter, Gross Profit was $754 million dollars at a margin of 44.3%, decreased from 48.6% in Q2 of 
2020, but improving compared to the three prior quarters. Margin dilution year over year is largely a 
consequence of our expansion of the first party commerce sales, and roll out of logistics fulfillment center 
operations. Sequentially, over the last year, we have been leveraging margin expansion in our payment 
collection fees and, since Q4’2020, have captured efficiencies in our shipping unit costs. As we do every 
quarter, we’ve included a detailed breakdown of these margin effects in the slides accompanying this 
presentation, as well as the OPEX margin evolution.
Following the trend from the first quarter, during the second quarter we continue to see scale and efficiency 
effects in our operating expenses year over year. Operating expenses were $588 million dollars, which 
represents 34.5% of net revenues, sustaining and slightly improving the operating leverage from prior 
quarters while maintaining consistent investment levels in product development and sales and marketing 
spend. 
During the second quarter, we reached strong, triple-digit top-line growth on an FX-neutral basis while 
delivering an improvement in EBIT profitability levels. We believe that we are investing towards sustainable 
growth and starting to reap some of the scale advantages that flow through our P&L.
Wrapping up our performance highlights for today, a final reflection. For many countries in Latin America, 
physical retail is only beginning to reopen, and there is still much uncertainty in the region surrounding the 
pandemic. Given this backdrop, our role is to keep expanding our ecosystem by staying committed to 
improving our service levels and our reach with our merchant and user bases. In addition, we will continue 
committed to investing in both user acquisition as well as improving and investing behind more features and 
user experience that improve customer retention and engagement, key factors of sustaining preference for 
the digital commerce and financial services that we can offer.
Finally, I would like to thank our now 20 thousand employees and our extended community of partners for 
another quarter of outstanding execution. 
We are grateful to everyone who has joined our quarterly conference call, and I look forward to sharing our 
progress next quarter with you. We are now happy to take your questions.

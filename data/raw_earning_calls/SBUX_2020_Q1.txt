Well, good afternoon, and welcome. Q1 was an exceptional quarter for Starbucks. The positive business 
momentum we've created over the past fiscal year continues with the strong start to fiscal 2020. These results 
were fueled by a healthy balance of comparable sales growth and new store development, as well as continued 
expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. I'm especially pleased that we delivered meaningful margin 
expansion in the quarter, even as we continued to invest in the key areas to support sustainable growth, first and 
foremost, in our partners, as well as in beverage innovation and digital customer relationships.

Given the strength of our Q1 results, we had intended to raise certain aspects of our full year financial outlook for 
fiscal 2020. However, due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus, we are not revising guidance at 
this time and as we get more clarity on the situation, we will transparently communicate with investors.
Our immediate focus is on two key priorities in China: first, caring for the health and well-being of our partners and 
customers in our stores, second, playing a constructive role in supporting local health officials and government 
leaders, as they work to contain the coronavirus. That said, we remain optimistic and committed to the long-term 
growth potential in China, a market, we have been in for more than 20 years.
Before I hand over to Pat, who will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance, let me share some 
highlights for the quarter, which provide powerful evidence of the unique strength of our brand. I will also outline 
additional steps we are taking that continue to elevate Starbucks in ways that will inspire our partners and deepen 
our relationship with customers.
In the first quarter, Starbucks delivered global revenue growth of 9%, excluding the 2% impact of Streamline 
activities. This was led by strong comp sales growth of 5% and net new store growth of 6% over the last 12 
months. At the forefront of these results were our two lead growth markets, the US and China, along with Channel 
Development.
The US grew revenues by an impressive 9% in Q1, led by comp sales growth of 6%, including comp transaction 
growth of 3% for a third consecutive quarter. With the two year sales comp of 10% for the past two consecutive 
quarters, it is clear that our focus on the customer experience, beverage innovation, and digital customer 
relationships is working. At the center of this are our Starbucks partners and the investments we continue to make 
in them. It is no coincidence that following last September's leadership experience where we hosted 12,000 
Starbucks field leaders and outlined a series of partner-focused initiatives and investments. Our partners 
delivered one of the most successful US holiday seasons in the history of the company.
Our partners in China also delivered a solid quarter with revenues increasing by 15% in Q1, excluding a 2% 
impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 16% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% 
increase in comp. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew total transactions at a double digit percentage 
pace in the strategically important market. On every market visit I make to China, I experience firsthand the 
passion, innovation and commitment our partners demonstrate each and every day, and I'm proud of them. Given 
the purposeful and highly differentiated partner investments, it is no surprise Starbucks was recently named 
China's Best Employer by Aon Hewitt for the fifth consecutive year.
Finally, on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestlé and Pepsi, our Channel Development revenue 
grew 5% in Q1, when normalized for the 7% impact of the Tazo and Global Coffee Alliance transitions, boosting 
our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. This is another example of the strength of the Starbucks 
brand that continues to expand globally, reaching more customers through more channels.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that we are on the right track with our Growth at Scale agenda. I am 
especially grateful to all Starbucks partners around the world, who celebrate coffee and human connection and 
whose passion and commitment to the Starbucks mission and our company values are creating long-term 
sustainable value for all stakeholders.
As we approach the 50th anniversary of Starbucks in 2021, I am optimistic about the future. Why? Well, when I 
step back and look at the quarter, I see multiple proof points of the unique strength of our brand, strength that is

derived from targeted investments that bolster our competitive position in a high growth category, enabling us to 
unlock the full potential of one of the world's most admired and trusted brands.
In the US, customer connection scores reached another all-time high in Q1, as our dedicated store partners 
continue to elevate the Starbucks Experience and deliver the very best moments with our customers each and 
every day. We realize this is a key differentiator for Starbucks, and we continue to make investments in partner 
hours, benefits and training. There is no doubt that our partners and the investments we make in them are at the 
core of creating the unique Starbucks Experience that fueled our Q1 performance.
Additionally, our brand equity research in the first quarter confirmed that Starbucks continues to lead consumer 
perceptions of specialty coffee retail concepts in the US, well ahead of other brands, including so-called thirdwave, independent and local coffee concepts. This is aided in part by our proprietary beverage innovation and our 
unique ability to personalize hand-crafted beverages at scale. We strengthened this competitive advantage in Q1 
by extending our Cold Brew platform and Cold Foam options with two new seasonal beverages, Pumpkin Cream 
Cold Brew and Irish Cream Cold Brew, which together contributed to our traffic growth for the quarter. Notably, for 
five consecutive quarters, our comp growth has outperformed the external indexes and benchmarks we track in 
the restaurant and QSR space.
Our brand strength was also evident on the digital front in Q1. In the US, we added a record 1.4 million customers 
to our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base, ending the quarter with 18.9 million active members, a 
16% increase over prior year. This is important, because we know from experience that when customers join our 
Rewards program, their total spend with Starbucks increases meaningfully. We also know that Starbucks is 
increasingly valued for convenience, as the mix of Mobile Order & Pay transactions in the US grew to 17% in Q1. 
And our industry-leading digital platform will further differentiate us from the competition over time.
Our digital progress in China was equally compelling and is resonating with the digitally savvy Chinese consumer. 
Proprietary research in Q1 showed that Starbucks remains the country's most beloved coffee brand and 
customers' first choice for away from home coffee. In the first quarter, sales from China's mobile orders jumped to 
15% of total revenue, up from 10% in the past quarter, with 9% coming from delivery and 6% from mobile order 
and pickup.
Underpinning these results was the continued growth of China's 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, 
reaching 10.2 million customers in Q1. That's 40% growth over the prior year, when the program was relaunched. 
Our first quarter digital strength in China was further evidenced by record sales on Alibaba's Singles' Day 
shopping festival, the number one card position on Tmall, and the leading brand on WeChat social gifting 
platform.
Over our 20 years in China, we've established unparalleled brand stature by delivering a unique premium 
experience to our customers. Outside of specialty coffee retail, the power of our brand was demonstrated by the 
continued expansion of our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, now in more than 40 markets, including the 
additional five new markets we entered in Q1, with product sales significantly ahead of expectations. Every 
customer interaction in our stores establishes customer affinity and brand loyalty, with the Global Coffee Alliance 
then acting as a brand amplifier, bringing Starbucks coffee to new channels and new markets.
Our Starbucks Reserve Roasteries are also important brand amplifiers. In November, we opened our Roastery in 
Chicago, our sixth Roastery globally, to a phenomenal customer reception. Since the opening, the store continues 
to gain international attention, attracting an average of 10,000 visitors a day, with a peak of more than 21,000

visitors in a single day. I want to thank our Starbucks partners who work in the Chicago Roastery as well as the 
City of Chicago for the warm welcome and spectacular response to the opening of the world's largest Starbucks.
These proof points provide clear evidence that the Starbucks brand is not only strong, but it is getting stronger 
through the focus and discipline of our Growth at Scale agenda. In fact, just last week, Starbucks was named one 
of Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the 18th consecutive year.
In summary, I could not be more pleased with our Q1 results and how they reinforce the unique strength of 
Starbucks, but make no mistake, we do not take this for granted. We will continue to take clear and decisive steps 
to build our brand for the future, focusing on our competitive advantages, investing in our partners as they create 
those unique Starbucks Experiences for our customers, driving beverage innovation and enhancing digital 
relationships. And while we do this, we are further amplifying our brand through the Global Coffee Alliance and 
committing to an even higher level of social responsibility with bolder aspirations for environmental sustainability.
As many of you've seen, last week we disclosed an ambitious, multi-decade aspiration for Starbucks to become a 
resource-positive company, which means, we, as a company, want to give more than we take from the planet. We 
thought long and hard about this aspiration and are being deliberate in our approach. Over the past year, we 
conducted a rigorous environmental sustainability study in partnership with third-party advocacy groups. We 
embraced science-based targets and utilized industry experts to audit every aspect related to Starbucks' impact 
on climate, water, and waste.
We've shared the sustainability baseline report and our aspirations transparently on our website, knowing that this 
will not be easy. The journey will not be linear. It will require innovation, many industry partnerships, alignment 
with other like-minded companies, public policy support, and engagement of Starbucks partners and customers. 
This will challenge us in new and different ways and will require transformational change and measured risktaking. We start this journey understanding our footprint, building upon our decade of experience in sustainability, 
and committing to lead on something that is important to all of humanity, taking care of our planet. And we invite 
others to join us.
As announced last week, we will be transparent in reporting short and long-term progress against our goals, and 
we will start with preliminary targets for 2030 that will be the focus of our research and operational plans going 
forward. Then, on Starbucks' 50th anniversary in 2021, we will formalize our 2030 environmental goals and our 
strategies based on what we have learned between now and then.
As we embark on this journey, we will prioritize, sequence, and balance our investments as we do across every 
aspect of our business. We remain committed to our ongoing double digit EPS growth model. We have 
momentum, our brand is strong, and we will continue to responsibly grow our business by staying true to our 
mission and values, doing the right things to care for and inspire our partners, creating great Starbucks 
Experiences for our customers, and pursuing a bold aspiration for the planet.
In closing, I would again like to thank my fellow Starbucks partners around the world. I have the privilege of 
sharing all your good work on these calls, and it is an honor to serve you and all of our stakeholders. I would also 
like to reiterate our support for the ongoing work as we respond to the coronavirus in a thoughtful and responsible 
way to protect our partners and support health officials and the government as they work to contain this public 
health risk. Starbucks has made a donation to the Red Cross to help support these efforts. We are making 
decisions real-time to ensure the health and well-being of our partners, and I am proud of how Starbucks China is 
navigating a very dynamic situation.

Now, I'll turn it over to Pat for a deeper dive into our Q1 financial results and an update on our fiscal year 2020 
outlook. Pat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp.
Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 for our first 
quarter of fiscal 2020, exceeding our expectations and reflecting a meaningful margin expansion in each of our 
operating segments. This represents a 16% increase year-over-year, when excluding an $0.08 headwind related 
to a lower income tax rate in fiscal 2019. These results underscore the strength of our brand globally and the 
outstanding underlying momentum across our business as we continue to execute our Growth at Scale agenda.
I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal 2020 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our 
consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for the full fiscal year.
Our Americas segment delivered revenue growth of 9% in Q1, primarily driven by 6% comp sales growth and net 
new store growth of 3% over the past 12 months. Our US business delivered an impressive 6% comp sales 
growth in Q1, driven equally by transactions and ticket. These results were driven by an improved partner-led instore experience, a strong beverage lineup, and increased digital customer engagement.
Beverage led our comp growth for a sixth consecutive quarter, driving approximately 5 points of comp sales 
growth, with strength across all beverage categories with food contributing the remaining point. Our cold platform 
continues to resonate with customers during all seasons and was our primary growth engine for the quarter led by 
cold coffee. Importantly, the growth in cold beverages in Q1 occurred in all dayparts and all regions, reflecting a 
broad appeal across our customer base.
Following the success of our fall seasonal offerings at the start of the quarter and building on the success of last 
year's season, our holiday platforms delivered strong performance that exceeded our expectations. Returning 
favorites such as Peppermint Mocha and new innovations like Irish Cream Cold Brew created momentum 
throughout the holiday period.
And, as Kevin mentioned, our Starbucks Rewards loyalty program continued to gain momentum, building on the 
launch of multi-tier redemption last April. Our reimagined Happy Hour resonated well with customers, driving 
additional member growth, and gift card activations delivered their strongest year-over-year dollar growth in four 
years.
Ticket growth of 3% for the quarter was led by pricing, beverage attach, and food. We saw transaction growth in 
both the morning and afternoon dayparts for a third consecutive quarter and our highest quarterly peak 
transaction growth in three years. These improvements would not have been possible without the dedication of 
our green apron partners who continue to accommodate higher volumes, while elevating the customer 
experience.
And finally, America's non-GAAP operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 22.0% in Q1 driven by sales 
leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree 
investments in labor hours and inflation and occupancy costs.
Moving on to International, the segment delivered revenue growth of 10% in Q1, excluding a 6% unfavorable 
impact of Streamline-related activities. This was led by 11% net new store growth over the past 12 months. 
International's comp sales growth of 1% in Q1 was adversely impacted by 2 points due to a soft quarter in Japan,

which was lapping 6% comp sales growth from last year. China, our lead international growth market, delivered 
solid comp sales growth of 3% in Q1 including 1% comp transaction growth. Continued expansion and strong 
performance of mobile ordering as well as the up-level Starbucks Rewards program were primary drivers of these 
results.
At the end of the first quarter, mobile order and pickup had been rolled out to more than 100 cities, encompassing 
more than 90% of our store base, just seven months following the launch of the program, and we expanded 
delivery to 130 cities, covering more than 80% of our portfolio.
International's non-GAAP operating margin increased by 170 basis points to 21.4%. When excluding the 70 basis 
point impact of Streamline-related activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 100 basis points, driven by 
sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorability in product mix and strategic 
investments, notably in-store and digital initiatives.
On to Channel Development, revenue declined 2% in Q1 as we lapped two items that benefited fiscal 2019, the 
sale of Tazo branded products to Unilever and transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance. When 
excluding the 7% adverse impact of these items as well as Global Coffee Alliance transition activities in fiscal 
2020, revenue increased by 5% in Q1, led by strong underlying growth in the Global Coffee Alliance. The 
segment's non-GAAP operating margin improved by 70 basis points over the prior year. Normalizing for the 20 
basis point impact of the transition activities, I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin 
expanded 90 basis points in Q1 driven by favorable distribution efficiencies and business mix.
Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin of 18.2% in Q1 increased by 80 basis points yearover-year primarily driven by sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. The favorability from these items was 
partially offset by growth in wages and benefits and to a lesser degree by rent inflation and investments in store 
labor hours. I am particularly pleased that we delivered meaningful margin expansion, while also continuing to 
invest in our partners, our stores, and our digital capabilities to keep the Starbucks brand strong and relevant. To 
a great extent, this reflects our ability to drive improvements in margin from sales leverage, as well as supply 
chain and G&A efficiencies and to reinvest a meaningful portion of that upside in our key brand differentiators 
which strengthen our competitive position and fuel long-term sustainable growth.
Now moving on to our guidance for fiscal 2020, given the strength of our first quarter results, we had intended to 
raise certain aspects of our guidance for the full fiscal year. However, as Kevin mentioned, given the extraordinary 
circumstances that are rapidly developing in China, we are simply reaffirming our original guidance and will 
provide an update when we have better visibility to the impact of coronavirus. The magnitude of the impact will 
depend on the duration of store closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and protect our 
partners and customers.
At present, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact to the business. Notwithstanding the fact that our 
China business represented only 10% of our global revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect these 
events to have a material impact on our International segment and consolidated results with the second quarter 
and full year of fiscal 2020. In any event, based on what we currently know, we expect the impact to our business 
will be temporary. Our brand is very strong in China, and our confidence in the profitability and growth potential of 
this business is undiminished.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and view these results as further validation 
of our strategy to grow Starbucks at scale with greater focus and discipline. We appreciate the hard work of our

Starbucks partners who deliver these results in a manner that remains true to our company's mission and values, 
which is the core of our business.
And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Roz Brewer and John Culver, as Durga 
outlined at the top of our call. Thank you. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please 
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Glass
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Thanks very much. Could you maybe just help us understand or dimensionalize the impact of China a little bit 
more? First, just when the stores were closed, those stores that aren't closed, maybe magnitude of what you think 
the sales declines are currently? And do you continue to pay employees? I assume you do, but just clarify that. 
And then finally, is delivery an offset? Is there a delivery business that can offset some of the closures? Or has 
that also been curtailed by this outbreak?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Johnson
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
Thanks, John. We'll have John Culver kind of give you a little bit of color on the day-to-day in China, and then Pat 
will follow up on the second part of your question related to the implications. John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Culver
Group President-International, Channel Development and Global Coffee & Tea, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. John, obviously Kevin reiterated the fact that we're focused on making sure we're taking care of our 
partners, their health and well-being as well as the customers. In terms of the closures, what we have seen is that 
over the last few weeks, I would say, that as the situation has accelerated, we've taken action to close stores, 
both working with the local government and the direction that they've given us, but then also proactively closing 
stores in the country. As we shared, we currently have over half our stores closed in the market. We are 
assessing this each and every day. We do have delivery available to customers from stores that are remaining 
open. But, again, this is something that we continue to assess every day.
And let me just reiterate, this is a very complex situation, and I'm working very closely with Belinda and the team 
in China to navigate this changing environment. And as a company, we've navigated complex situations before, 
and in China we feel there is no other company that's better positioned to navigate this, given our relationship that 
we – and trust we've been able to build with our partners and the relationship and trust that they've been able to 
build with their customers.
We will remain transparent as the events continue to unfold, but we do have complete confidence in the decisions 
that we're making, and we will continue to provide complete support for our partners and for the people of China 
as they navigate this situation. We've been in the market for 20 years, and we have built an admired and trusted 
brand. And we will continue to play the long game in China as we navigate in the coming weeks and months.

Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
And, John, this is Pat. Just to build on what John has said, it really is difficult to say at this juncture what the 
impact to our business will be and how it will show up in our financials, given the fluidity of the situation. The 
business impact is largely a function of two things: the number of stores closed and the duration of closure. And 
with respect to the duration of closure, it's not entirely in our control. I would say to a lesser extent, the financial 
impact is a function of how we manage wage costs during the period of closure. So we're simply not able to 
provide a reasonable estimate at this point in time. We will need to move beyond the extended Chinese New Year 
holiday season to assess how the situation may be stabilizing and what the implications are for store closures.
We're probably looking at early March at the earliest to reasonably assess the implications for revenue, operating 
income, and EPS for our second quarter and for the full year. At the very latest, we'll provide an update in 
conjunction with our Q2 earnings release on April 28. Our commitment is to maintain transparency with investors, 
and as and when we have a reasonable basis for estimating the financial impacts for the quarter and year, we will 
communicate that information.
But importantly, we do expect the impacts to be temporary. Our long-term double digit growth model is fully intact, 
and, of course, we will gain the benefit of lapping these temporary impacts next year.

David E. Tarantino
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Q
Hi. Good afternoon. And, Pat, maybe just following-up on some of those questions around the guidance, would 
you be willing to share where your guidance would be without this China issue, so that we can understand where 
the baseline of the underlying business is, especially if you want to assume that it's temporary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. I'm not going to provide details as to the magnitude of the guidance raise that we had planned or the 
specific line items, but I'm happy to share that we would have raised guidance or operating margin and for EPS 
on the strength of our Q1 results and visibility to some balance of your benefits. But given the uncertainty of the 
coronavirus situation in China and its impact to our near-term results, which we expect to be temporary, we felt it 
was best to defer any change to our guidance until we had better visibility to full year results, including the impact 
of coronavirus.
And as I said before, we're committed to being responsibly transparent with our investors, and we'll provide an 
update when we have reasonable confidence behind our numbers, because it would not be helpful to speculate at 
this time. But we could not be more pleased with our Q1 results across the board, the overall underlying 
momentum in our business, and the confidence that that gives us behind our ability to deliver better than 
expected results, setting aside this new issue that has emerged in China.

Hi. Good afternoon. I am not going to ask a China question. I actually wanted to talk about the Americas and the 
decline in G&A dollars year-over-year. I know it was modest, but if you could kind of talk about that, whether that 
was just timing. And then on Channel Development, I think you had expected revenue to go down somewhere 
between 7% and 9% this year. It was obviously a lot less in the first quarter in terms of the degree of decline. Is 
there something that's changed there? Is it a timing dynamic? More weighted to the back half for the declines? 
Any commentary would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Sharon, this is Pat. I'm happy to take both questions. First of all, with respect to the G&A, we are very pleased 
with the progress that we are making across the company in delivering our G&A efficiency commitment. As a 
reminder, we had committed to reduce by 100 basis points G&A as a percentage of system sales. That is not 
something that we routinely report because we don't report system sales, but a good proxy for that is non-GAAP 
G&A as a percentage of revenue and we do report that. We've added that to our supplementary schedules in our 
earnings release. And we have seen meaningful efficiencies emerge in the first quarter, and we expect that to 
continue balance of year. That's on the back of very significant work over the last 12 to 18 months to realize 
productivity in our G&A, not just in the Americas, but really across all of our segments and certainly at Corporate.
And then with respect to the Global Coffee Alliance, we did see better than expected results in the first quarter. 
We did anticipate a decline for the first quarter and for the full year, but our better than expected results in the first 
quarter resulted from outperformance, specifically in the Global Coffee Alliance. So we could not be more pleased 
with how our products are performing as we continue to partner with Nestlé, and we anticipate that was going to 
be one of the aspects of our improved guidance for the year is better than expected revenue growth from our 
Channel Development segment.

John Culver
Group President-International, Channel Development and Global Coffee & Tea, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. And so, Sharon, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of the Channel Development business, 
in particular the Global Coffee Alliance. Through the quarter, we saw acceleration into 40 markets around the 
world where we have our products available through grocery as well as foodservice. We also are on path by the 
end of this quarter that we're in to be in over 50 markets.
Our product sales continue to be significantly ahead of expectations, both in terms of packaged coffee, Nespresso 
capsules, as well as Dolce Gusto. When you look at our core business here in the US, Starbucks brand outgrew 
the total category for coffee. Roast and ground share grew 80 basis points. K-Cup share grew 40 basis points. 
And we've got some exciting new items that are coming up.
Later this spring, we previously announced that we're launching premium soluble coffee, which will – we're 
excited about and a big opportunity internationally with that. And then the launch that we had with our creamers of 
four flavors we're now expanding to an additional two new flavors given the recent success.

the Starbucks brand and amplify the brand, as Kevin highlighted in his comments earlier.

John Ivankoe
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi. Thank you. I was hoping to get an update on Deep Brew, especially as we come into April and I think lap 
some changes around the change in the AI machine that delivered some customized loyalty to customers as well 
as the change in the My Starbucks Rewards program, maybe as a slightly separate, but related question, how 
much, I guess, confidence do you have as we do get into some of the strength that we saw in fiscal 2019 that we 
can lap some of those significant changes in the consumer offerings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Johnson
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
John, I'll let – I have Roz give you a little perspective on Deep Brew and how it's influencing our performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rosalind Gates Brewer
Chief Operating Officer, Group President & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
Thanks, John, for the question. So, first of all, I wanted to ground everybody in what's happening in some of our 
equipment innovation. And one of the strongest pieces of innovation that we're seeing is combining our Mastrena 
II machine, which is our espresso machine, which we installed about 1,900 units last year. We've got 4,000 of 
those coming this year, and those machines are AI-enabled. And so that is where we will see the most significant 
deliverable around how we will integration AI into understanding how to deliver the best coffee experience and 
also reducing the amount of time it takes to deliver and then giving us a chance to provide a variety of coffee to 
our customers. So you'll see that come through.
There's also other innovation happening around Deep Brew. It will show up in various aspects of the business, but 
the equipment position is our strongest position right now. In addition to that, when we talk about the things that 
have happened in our loyalty program, we did see some significant improvement in this quarter. Right now we 
finished this quarter at about 18.9 million growth, and that's a 16% improvement versus last year in our active 
Starbucks Rewards members. It's the strongest growth rate we've seen in three years. So the work that we've 
done in our multi-tier redemption is also allowing us to grow our member base. We've got an increase of annual 
member growth of 2.7 million members. And we're also seeing all-time records in that area as well. It's enabling 
us to do really creative work with how we reimagine our Happy Hour performance, making sure that we are 
understanding what the customer needs.
There's a lot of customer insights that comes out of the work that we do as we grow our member base. We're also 
seeing that our loyalty programs and the new membership behavior that we're seeing, which contributed 2 points 
of the 6% comp for the quarter. So we are learning from what's happening as we align AI to our equipment, and 
then the work that comes out of our loyalty programs and getting us closer to customers' expectations. And it's 
making a difference.

Jeffrey A. Bernstein
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Great. Thanks very much. Just a broader question on China learnings. Putting aside the coronavirus, clearly 
there's lots of competition in the market, I think oftentimes coming in on the lower end in terms of experience and 
perhaps customer affluence. So I'm just wondering, what learnings would you say you've taken from this 
competition to better your positioning? It seems like you had a slowdown a year ago, and now it seems like trends 
are moving in the upward direction, again, I'm just wondering if you can provide some clarity in terms of which two 
or three initiatives would you say maybe you took some learnings from some of that competition to better yourself 
in the market. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Johnson
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
John, why don't you take that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Culver
Group President-International, Channel Development and Global Coffee & Tea, Starbucks Corp. A
Well, Jeffrey, I think there's a couple of things around what we're doing in China. First and foremost, focusing on 
the premium quality of the coffee and our ability to hand-craft the beverages for customers to the way they want it. 
We feel that there is no other competitor in China that is able to do it and replicate it at the level that we are, as 
signified by more than 7 million customers we serve a week across the 4,300 stores. In addition, you then have 
the opportunity of developing these relationships between our partners and our customers. And our partners are 
truly the differentiating factor in terms of bringing the Starbucks Experience to life for our customers. And when 
you go to China and you experience our people and their passion for coffee and their passion for service to 
customers, that is a true differentiator that we have in the market.
You then put all that together in the third place, and the beauty of our stores, the inviting environment, the way in 
which we show up in the third place, we have an environment that customers come to and want to be with their 
family and friends. Now what we've done is we've also enhanced that with the digital experience. And we had a 
great quarter as it relates to digital. We now have 90-day actives grew 40% year-over-year to 10.2 million, that's 
nearly double from where it was a year ago.
We've also gone through and built out Mobile Order & Pay capability as well as delivery. So mobile orders in total 
reached more than 15% of sales mix in the quarter compared to 10% in Q4, so 9% being delivery, 6% being 
Mobile Order & Pay. And we're continuing to build out these digital relationships with customers.
Then you couple all that with the Global Coffee Alliance and our RTD business in China. There is no other 
company brand in China that has the distribution points that we have. We have over 100,000 points of distribution 
of the Starbucks brand in China, and our partners are bringing it to life every day. And it's their passion and their 
commitment that is making us successful and will continue to make us successful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Johnson
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
Let me just add to John's comments and share a perspective, Jeffrey. I think, look, throughout history, we've had 
many, many competitors enter the market. Look, coffee is a large and growing addressable market, and we stay 
focused on the premium experience and the unique differentiators that, we believe, create Starbucks. And if you 
look throughout history, there's a consistent pattern. In most all cases, our competitors shift to focusing more on 
the value play, and you see that time and time again. And I think we continue to see that trend.

So the lesson for us is, continue to amplify those unique differentiators that make us Starbucks. And that's why as 
you think about the Growth at Scale, we really, as John said, amplify the customer experience we create in the 
store. We amplify the quality of our coffee and the beverage innovation that we provide, the fact those beverages 
are hand-crafted and personalized for each and every customer, and then we extended that in-store experience 
to a digital customer relationship.
And that mix of ingredients are what differentiates us, and we feel confident that we understand them. We don't 
compromise those, and we stay focused on playing our game. It's worked in the past. It's working today, and it will 
work in the future.

your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew DiFrisco
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Thank you. I just had a couple of follow-ups. With respect to China, thank you for sharing that about the 10% of 
global revenue. Is it correct then I guess to also assume – in your past Analyst Days you've obviously shown how 
strong of a market and the opportunity and the returns there. That also would then by default have a higher 
contribution to the income, I suspect? And then if you could comment also, is this – the travel restrictions, are they 
having any sort of impact also on the ability to meet those growth targets? I know you have 600 stores planned for 
that country. Is that something also that's sort of been halted during this timeframe as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. Matthew, this is Pat. With respect to the first question, China's operating income as a percentage of 
business unit operating income globally is slightly higher than the 10% that it represents of revenue. And over to 
John for the second piece.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Culver
Group President-International, Channel Development and Global Coffee & Tea, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. Matthew on the store side of it, I think it's too early to tell. We're committed to the numbers that we 
previously communicated around store growth in China, and we'll continue to build beautiful stores and accelerate 
the growth of the brand. Suffice it to say new stores contribute 80% of our revenue growth in the market, and it's 
an important component and one that we'll continue to focus on with the team there.

Thank you. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the continued strength of US traffic. Maybe, Roz, can you talk a 
bit more about where that's coming from? How much of it is higher frequency from existing customers versus 
maybe some new customers? And any other observations or insights that you could share? And then I think 
you've touched on the drivers, but if there is anything you can get into more on how much of it is experience 
versus digital versus the beverage innovation that you feel is driving that traffic piece, if you can dive into that any 
more. Thank you.

Rosalind Gates Brewer
Chief Operating Officer, Group President & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. Thank you, Dennis. So, a couple of things. You heard Kevin, in Kevin's remarks that we achieved the 6% 
comp in this quarter, 5 of those 6 points came from beverage growth. So beverage innovation is a large part of 
the work that we're doing that also is impacted by the work we're doing in in-store innovation also and the 
efficiencies that we're building there and then the digital relationships.
If I could go a little bit further into the efficiencies that we're seeing in the store, we are actually doing a large 
amount of work around creating and improving productivity in the stores. And in many cases, this is not 
productivity driving activity by taking hours out and really reducing our cost position in the stores, it's actually to 
allow our partners to spend more time with our customers. So we're seeing record scores at this time of customer 
connection scores in our stores. These are record numbers. We believe it's a multitude of things, dealing with 
reducing the amount of tasks, the menial tasks that our store managers and our baristas have to do in our stores.
In addition to the equipment improvements that we're seeing, we have Nitro Cold Brew across all of our stores 
right now. When we put in the Mastrena II machine, we're seeing operational efficiencies. It's a lower profile 
machine. It allows our partners to see over the bar and interact with the customers. We're actually seeing a 
significant amount of work coming out of the work we have learned through our digital relationships. So we know 
more about who is coming in the morning.
Kevin's remarks also reveal that we are growing in every daypart. We're also seeing a significant growth pattern in 
our cold coffee. And so that includes all cold beverages, meaning tea as well. And we're seeing cold beverages 
grow in the morning and the afternoon occasion. We're seeing also, too, the work – if you recall when we began 
to grow and change our program in loyalty around multi-tier redemption, we are seeing growth with the occasional 
customer. And there is some connection between cold coffee, afternoon occasion, and the occasional customer. 
We are seeing growth after 11 o'clock in the afternoon with the occasional customer and with cold coffee.
So we think that it's that combination that's really happening for us, Dennis, in terms of the beverage innovation. 
So right beverage for our customer base, improving the work that our partners have to do in our stores, so that 
they can interact with the customers and improve customer engagement, and then learning from our digital 
relationships and understanding how to market to our customer base and bring them in the store. And a great 
example of that is our reimagined Happy Hour. And so we're doing, we're combining these three initiatives 
together, and we are convinced that this work and the discipline around it is really driving our comp performance. 
And we can see this in future quarters ahead of us.

Sara Harkavy Senatore
Analyst, Sanford C Bernstein & Co., LLC Q
Hi. Thank you. I have a question and then a quick follow-up. Just on the margins, you had said that, that was a 
place where you would have probably raised guidance. I think in general, Pat, you've said you wanted to be 
conservative on guidance. But could you just talk a little bit about whether the beat versus expectations was in 
fact just how you positioned the guidance? Or whether there are some surprises in there? Supply chain, obviously 
the comps were a bit better than you would, I think, have expected or the long-term algorithm would suggest. So if 
you can just talk about where the margin upside with maybe some specific initiatives or sources would be?

And then just my follow-up is, you had said that the wide-scale closures in China and the store closures to be the 
primary driver of the impact on the business. So does that suggest that, for the stores that are remaining open, 
you're not really seeing a change in trend in the China stores? I would have thought there would be more of an 
impact on consumer confidence broadly. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Thank you, Sara. I'll take both questions and then pivot to John for additional color on China. First of all, with 
respect to margin performance in the quarter, we were really delighted with our overall margin outcome in Q1. 
And what was better than expected was, to your point, higher than expected comp growth, and with that strong 
sales leverage, contributing positively to margin. We also had stronger than expected benefits from our supply 
chain. Part of that was a function of the fact that in the US, we had such strong sell-through for our food, 
beverages, and merchandise in holiday that we did not incur the level of inventory reserves that we've seen in the 
past. So a number of initiatives came together to deliver really strong margin performance in Q1, and that was the 
overriding contributor to what we had planned by way of a margin guidance raise for the full year.
With respect to China and the drivers of the business impact, I highlighted that the number of stores and duration 
of closure are the two primary drivers of the business impact. That's not to say that there aren't other drivers or 
other considerations here. And certainly the reduced retail footfall that we're seeing across the country in the 
wake of the efforts taken to contain the virus and how customers generally are a bit reticent to perhaps visit 
commercial centers versus previously is another factor. So it is a contributing factor, but the big factor really is the 
duration of closure, and I'll really pivot to John for additional color on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Culver
Group President-International, Channel Development and Global Coffee & Tea, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. So, Sara, obviously we're tracking customers and transactions in our stores that we have open. And we 
look at that each and every day. I would say that, versus historical levels, it definitely has slowed down from – and 
Pat gave you a little bit of color on that. We look at this each and every day. We've taken action in our open stores 
to adjust operating hours. We've also gone in and adjusted some of the product offerings based on supply chain 
availability. And then we've also taken a look at specific trade areas, where we can consolidate the stores into one 
store that's meaningful and reaches customers.
So a lot of different actions are being taken, but as Pat shared, the majority of the impact will come from the 
closed stores. But this is something we assess every day. As you're aware, Chinese New Year has been 
extended, and we're continuing to watch this very closely with the team in China.

David Palmer
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q
Thanks. Just a follow-up on the US and the beverage contribution of 5 points which is certainly much higher than 
it was a couple years ago. If we look back that far, it feels like the Frappuccino platform has stabilized, and we've 
seen the benefit of some of the newer cold beverage platforms like Cold Brew and Nitro and perhaps with the 
help of Foam more recently. Could you talk about the biggest contributors to the improvement if we kind of look at 
this from a multi-year perspective? And if we're looking forward in a similar way, could you talk about the biggest 
contributors to beverage growth going forward and how you feel about the pipeline of beverage news kind of 
keeping this energy going in the beverage side? Thanks.

Rosalind Gates Brewer
Chief Operating Officer, Group President & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
Yes, David. Thanks for the question. So, a few things. If you recall, last year this time we were probably issuing a 
lot of LTOs, limited time offers. Some of that was Frappuccino based. We were not penetrated with enough Nitro 
equipment technology in the stores, and Nitro, we knew, was a growing category. So what you're seeing right now 
is our execution of putting Nitro in every one of our buildings in the US and so that's a big transition that we've 
made.
In addition to that, playing into cold coffee and that process of creating and leaning into cold. And what you can 
see in the future from that is that we do have equipment improvements coming in our Cold Brew technology. Part 
of that is making sure that we are in stock at all times with this process, and so we actually have the equipment 
changes coming in the future for that.
I'll also mention, too, that you've seen us add alternative milks to our beverage line which gives us a chance to 
customize. We know that there is a portion of our customer base that wants more of a healthy-for-you concept, 
and so you've seen some of the work that we have done to add oat milks regionally across the country. And as 
that becomes more available in the industry, we will acquire more of that capacity. In addition to that, our hot 
business is holding very nicely for us.
Also, from a holiday perspective, we introduced beverages that have high demand, if you think about the Irish 
Cream Cold Brew and then what we were able to do with the Pumpkin Spice category. What also gives us 
confidence as we go forward is the works that we're doing to make sure that we can deliver on what the 
customers are asking us for. So you'll see more coming in the alternative milk category for us, and then playing 
into the cold category.
Also, in terms of what helps us sell beverages is our food attach. We will be introducing a breakfast sandwich this 
year with a plant-based patty both in US and Canada, and the combination of those pairings is significant for us in 
terms of how we think about what the customer is asking for us to develop.
I'll also mention that we are seeing still growth in our morning dayparts and with MOP, but it's significant to also 
mention that in this quarter we opened our first convenience store. So we're seeing increased traffic when we 
create new formats. Our first introduction to this was in Penn Plaza in New York. I had the chance to visit there in 
the last 10 days. Customer response is very favorable. It is showing just one more way that our brand is 
significant to our customer.
Once you exit Penn Plaza Station, you come right up to the store. Customers are responding that it feels like a 
walk through. It has our latest technology in there from the digital boards that really announce when your drink is 
ready. It's those kinds of things combined with beverage innovation that give us the confidence that we're listening 
to our customers and providing them access to our stores, access to our brand, the way they want to acquire their 
coffee and also listening to them in terms of how we should grow our beverage innovation.
So we are committed to this category of cold coffee and also making sure that we're staying close to what the 
customer would like to see in what's next in their beverage preference.

Eric Gonzalez
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just have one question on China and then maybe a follow-up. So it seems 
like you're pushing more aggressively into the lower tier cities where coffee consumption is a little bit lower than it 
might be in the higher tier cities. So if you can talk about how the return's equation works in those lower tier cities 
and maybe how the product mix differs in those types of locations?
And then as a follow-up to that, with the delivery driving 9% sales mix this quarter, does that imply that the onpremise business is running negative [ph] if – it's (00:59:05) early days about this time last year in the delivery 
rollout? So can you maybe talk about why that might be the case? Is it competition, potentially sales transfer? Or 
is delivery itself cannibalizing your in-store business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Culver
Group President-International, Channel Development and Global Coffee & Tea, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. Eric, this is John. Just to answer your question, in the quarter, we opened 167 stores, 46% of those were 
either in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We do see very strong performance in lower tier cities, and we continue to make 
investments in those cities playing the long game. Clearly when we open our first few stores, there is a lot of 
demand for Starbucks coming into those cities. As we continue to build out the footprint, what we've seen 
historically is that the total transactions obviously continue to grow, and volumes show up as very similar to some 
of our outer Tier 1 cities. So we feel good about our growth in these Tier 4, Tier 5 cities overall.
In terms of the delivery aspect of it at 9%, clearly we see a lot of benefit. It creates a whole new occasion for our 
existing customers, and it's helping to drive transaction growth in our stores. We have over 3,500 stores in 130 
cities, which is 80% of the store base, having delivery available to them. We see it as an incremental for these 
existing customers as well as attracting new customers. In total, dollar profits continue to increase because of it. 
It's slightly margin dilutive, but it does provide a higher ticket as well as a higher food attach. And we also see 
stronger demand in the mornings and during the lunch daypart.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you. I have a couple of questions here. So, first of all, on International, stripping out the strength that 
you saw in China, it looks like the rest of International was pretty weak on the traffic side. So I was wondering if 
you could walk through dynamics you're seeing in select markets there. And then on the point that was made 
earlier about the supply chain and having some problems stocking stores in the region in China, for the ones that 
are open, are you guys seeing difficulty transporting goods and services across the country at this point? And if 
that is the case, would there be any kind of ripple-through effect to maybe push out of new store openings and 
unit growth? Thank you.

Japan market and what we saw in Japan. And when you look at Japan overall, we had two major factors that 
influenced the comp performance in Japan. First was, early on in the quarter, we had a devastating typhoon that

went through the country, which impacted two full days of sales in the market. The second piece was the increase 
in consumption tax that took place in early October. The good news that we saw through the quarter is that comps 
accelerated through the quarter back to more normal levels. So we do feel good about the trends that we're 
currently seeing in Japan.
When you look more broadly across the International segment and you look at in specifics EMEA and Asia 
Pacific, we saw strong growth in both of those regions through our license partnerships. UK in particular did very 
well. We had Middle East in EMEA that also performed well. And then when you go over to Asia Pacific, Korea 
had another strong quarter, which was great to see. And then we had some smaller markets, Philippines, 
Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand doing well as well.
Switching to your question on China on goods and services, we're monitoring each and every day the supply 
chain challenges. Clearly in Hubei province, that area is impacted the most in terms of supply chain given the 
limited travel that's taking place in that city. We haven't seen that meaningful impact take hold in other cities. 
Although, as I shared, we continue to adjust the menus in our stores and the offerings to accommodate any 
supply chain challenges we have.

Frederick Wightman
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Hey, guys. It's actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Just one quick follow-up. In your response to an earlier 
question as far as the changes to the full year outlook, you had alluded to some additional visibility, I think it was 
on operating margins or earnings for the balance of the year, what exactly were you referring to there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. So this is Pat. We see further upside in our Channel Development business specifically. So we have a 
stronger outlook for full year revenue and flow-through associated with that in Channel Development. There were 
a couple of other line items where we were anticipating making some adjustments as well. But far and away the 
key driver of what we had planned by way of a guidance raise was the extraordinary strength of our Q1 results.

Andrew Charles
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Thanks. Roz, one of the more impressive drivers of the US same-store sales has been growth in loyalty program 
with the 1.4 million members added during 1Q, [indiscernible] (01:05:31) highest it's been on record since you 
guys have been disclosing this. And I was wondering, with this growing base of users, can you talk about the 
changes in the tactics you're using to market more effectively to these customers to help increase the spend as 
well as the visitation?

So, yes, Andrew, just a few things there. One is we have a very effective media spend. And so if you go back a 
year or so ago, we were either – had very small investments in our media spend or not very directed. And so now 
we are better at understanding almost a one-to-one relationship with that consumer. And so if we have an email 
address, we can look at their past purchases and then suggest to them what they could enjoy in our stores, and 
then also to alert them to Happy Hour and other events that are happening in the store. And we didn't have that in 
the past.
And then in addition to that is when we introduce new items and so what we're seeing from a Cold Brew 
perspective is also just speaking to them about the new cold beverages. So it's having that one-to-one 
relationship and access to them and can personalize the offerings that we have to our customer base.
In addition to that, some of the other works that we're doing is to help our partners in the stores understand who is 
shopping in the stores. And so they know their customers just by the relationships that they've built over the 
years, but now they know a little bit more about who is shopping in their stores and who is visiting our cafés. And 
so we share that information with our partners in the stores, and it makes them very effective at the work that they 
do. And so it's a lot of the insights that we're gathering, we're using it to make our decisions. And also, too, it's 
fueling how we think about what innovation that we want to build and develop.
And so we're using our insights effectively, learning from our new members that are growing, and then watching 
the work that we need to do as we look at the multi-tier redemption program, which is still just approaching a year 
in terms of its full national rollout.

Operator: Your next question comes from Gregory Frankfurt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your 
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory R. Francfort
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hey. Thank you very much for the question. Just looking back to the US business on, I guess, 18 to 24 months of 
slowdown in store growth, with that perspective, have you seen maybe less cannibalization from new stores? Or 
is that something that you guys have seen maybe flow back into comps, and that's part of the reason why they've 
picked up a few points? Any perspective on that? And then as we look forward, I think we're at the bottom of your 
3% to 4% unit growth. Is this kind of how we should think about the longer term framework for [indiscernible] 
(01:08:24) store growth being in the US? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rosalind Gates Brewer
Chief Operating Officer, Group President & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
So a few things there in terms of our store growth in the US. And so we're seeing pretty much the same amount of 
cannibalization in our business. There is no change there. For us, the best investment we could make is our new 
store growth. We appreciate the return on invested capital that we're seeing with our new store investments, so 
you'll see that continue.
What we've been doing is really looking at our formats and making sure that, as we add delivery and new stores, 
we're looking at coverage and how we cover our customer in the United States. One of the things I'll mention is
the combination of delivery to our new store growth. We just added a total of 3,500 stores now across 49 markets 
in delivery. And so we have a broad amount of coverage in the US combining with that. And we still have the 
estimated number of new stores coming in the US and really advancing our format developments, anything from

our new format in terms of the convenience stores, all the way to our Roastery plans. So we are still encouraged 
by our investments in new real estate, and we're not seeing any shift in cannibalization in our business right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick J. Grismer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
And, Greg, this is Pat. To build on what Roz has said, we would reaffirm our net store growth guidance for the US 
at 3% to 4%.

Operator: Your last question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. You may ask your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R.J. Hottovy
Analyst, Morningstar, Inc. (Research) Q
Thanks, and thanks for letting me get a question in here. Just one follow-up question for Roz and you kind of 
hinted on this on the last answer, but one area we haven't heard a lot about is that delivery program. And 
obviously you've been working with some new restaurant formats and developing that, but just wanted to see if 
you could provide us an update in terms of where that initiative stands and what takeaways you've had. Obviously 
you've shared some takeaways from the China in terms of attach rates and new customer growth, but just any 
takeaways you've seen with the delivery program so far in the US?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rosalind Gates Brewer
Chief Operating Officer, Group President & Director, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. So, yes. We are continuing to expand. Because we're now at 75% US coverage of all Starbucks stores, we 
are now into a national marketing program, which, if you remember, this time last year we were roughly about 115 
stores with no marketing against it. And so we are encouraged to continue to see what happens when we alert 
the customer that delivery is available at their favorite location. Our stores are equipped from a technology 
standpoint. The partners are well trained in terms of how to handle the trade-off between the transition of the 
beverage to the pickup delivery person. So operationally, it's working extremely well. We'll continue to watch it.
One thing I will say about the US business, if you compare it to China in terms of delivery, the adoption rate is still 
pretty modest in the US. And so we're just moving right along with the customer and making it available to as 
much coffee coverage as we can in the US. But it's modestly being adopted in the US if you compare it to China.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Johnson 
for closing remarks.

Kevin Johnson
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Starbucks Corp.
Well, thank you, all, for joining us on today's call. I want to close by recognizing my Starbucks partners around the 
world for such a strong Q1 performance and the underlying business momentum that we are building as a 
company. I also want to recognize my Starbucks partners who are navigating the dynamic situation related to the 
coronavirus in China. As we deal with these extraordinary circumstances, we will remain focused on caring for the 
health and well-being of our partners, supporting health officials as they work to contain the coronavirus, and 
doing all of this staying true to the mission and values that built this great company.
To our investors, I appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through the temporary business 
impacts in China. We are as confident as ever in the strength and resilience of our double digit earnings growth

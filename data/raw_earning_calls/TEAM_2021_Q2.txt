MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of 
Fiscal Year 2021. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the 
Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's head of Investor Relations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Sonefeldt
Vice President-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian's second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Thank you for joining us 
today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike CannonBrookes; as well as our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our second quarter of fiscal 2021. The shareholder letter was posted on our company blog and all items have also 
been posted to the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website. On our IR site, we have also posted a 
supplemental data sheet. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time 
on Q&A.
This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially 
different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking 
statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such 
statements are made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or 
cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial 
results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including 
the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and quarterly Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures 
are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures 
versus our nearest IFRS equivalents and it may be different from non- IFRS measures and non-GAAP measures 
used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our 
earnings release, our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on the IR website.
During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Lastly, 
we have announced dates for Team 2021, our virtual annual customer conference, taking place April 28 and 29. 
We hope to see you there.
With that, I'll turn this call to Scott for opening remarks.

Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Thank you, everyone, for joining today. We hope you and your loved ones remain safe during these challenging 
times.
We hope you're taking the time to read the shareholder letter. This quarter, we focused on three themes tied to 
Atlassian's long-term focus. First, that we're off to a strong start in our multi-year initiative to migrate our server 
customers to the cloud. Second, we continue to deliver mission critical solutions for our customers across large 
TAMs through products like Jira Service Management which launched in Q2. And third, that we will continue to 
use the cloud to deliver innovation to customers small and large in our ultimate goal to serve the Fortune 500,000.
Our business results reflect steady execution against our goals. In Q2, we generated $501 million in revenue, up 
23% year-over-year. We also achieved subscription revenue growth of 36%. During the quarter, we added a 
record 11,617 net new customers of all sizes, bringing our total count to over 194,000. While we're proud of these 
results, there's plenty of hard work that lies ahead.
Before we move to Q&A, Mike and I want to thank our employees who continue to inspire us with their passion for 
customers and their adaptability. You make unleashing the potential of all things possible. With that, I'll pass the 
call to the speaker.
So I called him speaker. They're waiting for me to say the word operator.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital 
Markets. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the new customer adds, the strength there, what drove 
that? Is there something changing with the SMB customer base? Is there certain verticals that stood out to you? 
Just a little bit of context around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Great question. Look, if you've been around for a while, Alex, you'll know that the new customer number 
bounces around a lot. We had about 3,000 in Q4, 8,000 and a bit in Q1 and, of course, 11,500 now. And it's not a 
number we guide towards or we really manage into Atlassian. And it's also always been a pretty small driver of 
immediate revenue being the smallest of our customers.
What changed this quarter is with a lot of the funnel changes. We've gone around three in some of our products. 
Also, in Trello, we changed the monetization funnels. A lot of those areas which we are really proud of like they're 
– it kind of put us in the right place for very long-term growth. They did change sort of the mix of customer ratios 
and we do have a larger mix of smaller customers.

And so I'd say more than any other quarters, we probably have a greater ratio of smaller customers than we've 
had before. So we think it's great. I think it's again a great testament to how much demand there is for our 
products out there but I'm hesitant to try and roll any of that in to some sort of revenue forecast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital 
Markets, Inc.
Q
And just looking at these new customer adds, were any of those potentially customers that churned in the first half 
of 2020 and they're back? I don't know if you categorize them differently if they did churn and they're back.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I don't have numbers around that at hand, unfortunately. We have seen improved churn in general across most of 
our product base. Some of that is things we've done and some of it could be macro trends as well.
James, do you want to comment as well on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Just a couple of things to add to that, Scott. I would say that I was pleased with the customer count 
because it illustrates the mission critical nature of the products that we serve our customers with of all sizes all 
across the board from small, medium-sized businesses through to the largest corporations, governments, and so 
forth. So, pleased by that churn, as Scott was saying there, has increased – improved nicely as the recent 
quarters have gone by.
So, you're right. We did see some challenges back in Q4 of fiscal 2020. But as we've seen our churn improve, as 
we've seen our customer count go for this past Q2, we've really seen those improvements right across our 
verticals and, again, right across the different sizes of customers that we serve. So, we're pleased by all of those 
themes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and really nice quarter. If I could kind of squeeze in two 
questions, one, just on the overall spending environment, if you had an idea kind of where we are on that road to 
recovery. You talked about improving renewal rates. That sounds like that's getting better but just kind of your 
take on kind of where we are on that.
And, two, in particular on the ITSM product, now that we've integrated Mindville and you have that CMDB 
component of the equation, is that enabling the solution to go further upmarket? Have you seen any evidence of 
that traction as of yet?

It's Mike here. Let me take – let James take the question on the spending environment and the [indiscernible] 
(00:08:43) and I can come back on the ITSM one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
On the spending environment, obviously, we're pleased by what we see is a nice gradual improvement. Now, it's 
hard to pass that out because I feel as though our products really are serving so many of the critical needs of our 
customers. There is increasing movement to agile frameworks. The work-from-home process is now becoming 
such a normal part of business life and, of course, our tools help support that. So we've been pleased by the 
themes that we've seen in Atlassian in recent weeks and months.
Mike?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, mate. I can address the ITSM question there. Look, as you mentioned, Jira Service Management launched 
about a quarter ago now and we've been very pleased with the results so far, mostly obviously inside a quarter 
and our model customer reaction, customer adoption acceleration of purchasing the interest behavior.
As you mentioned, it is a great example of Atlassian's overall philosophy of both building and integrating smartly 
acquisitions, as you mentioned, in the CMDB facilities. Again, those are released as a plug-in at the moment but 
not fully integrated into Jira Service Management yet. So those will be coming in the coming quarters. So as a 
part of our long-term ITSM strategy, you see a constant drumbeat of improvements there.
At a whole level, customers have resonated with us, seeing the blurring of lines between IT and software 
development as we are sort of the one company that can serve their needs from software development through 
Ops, DevOps, and into their IT and technical teams on that end. So that's really resonating with customers, and 
we're very excited about that.
And again, focusing on the Fortune 500,000 gives us a very broad customer adoption cycle all the way up to large 
customers as you see from the ISS customer example in the shareholder letter, some very, very big customers 
adopting our ITSM offerings as well.

Thank you, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. I'd like to focus on the 30,000 server customers that you're trying 
to migrate to the cloud over the next two, three years. Can you give us some color on how much movement was 
there this quarter in that transition, how many of the small, medium, large have transitioned?
And then second, how would you think about churn in this group? I'm sure a lot of people or some customers are 
probably not that happy about – although while recognizing and appreciating the benefits of the cloud and the 
capabilities that come along with that, pricing is – could be materially different, especially for large customers. So, 
help me think about how would you think about churn in this transition over the next couple of years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks. Good question. Firstly, just remind everyone, we have 30,000 server customers and we're aiming to 
move them over a multi-year period with end of life server and our customers have three years to make a decision 
to move across before they keep our end of maintenance period. So, we've been very friendly to our customers 
and we have a pretty wide window for those customers to move across.
In terms of our – where we are, like it's very early in that and [indiscernible] (00:12:40) numbers of our internal 
metrics. We're doing exactly what we said we were going to do. We've got customers moving across at higher 
levels than ever before. Our numbers internally that we measure for this quarter were a new high, as you would 
expect, as we go through this transition and also a reminder that the majority of our new customers today choose 
cloud. So, well over 95% of our customers choose cloud – our new customers choose cloud today and so we're 
really happy with the leading indicators. That's great.
In terms of churn, when I talk with our largest of customers, they're companies you would all know and do 
business with and they all have plans to move to the cloud. Like they say that it saves them money, saves them 
the hassle of doing things, get some high reliability. And so they are all partnered up with us to move to the cloud. 
In most cases, it's in our court to ensure that we have the size and scale and that we can help them migrate 
across. And so it is hard to predict the churn on that like because it is in our customers' hands over a period of 
time. But I'm pretty pleased with the indications of what we've got at the moment and sort of the customer 
response.
James, do you want to add anything to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Just that back at Investor Day in November, we noted our expectation that around half of our 30,000 server 
customers would migrate in FY 2023 and beyond. And, indeed, for our medium or larger-sized customers, we 
would expect that ratio to be about two-thirds migrating in FY 2023 and beyond and nothing has changed in our 
perspective there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Very good. Thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up on the perpetual license revenue, which clearly was still 
strong and it's for obvious reasons. People want to do things before February, I guess next week kicks in. But with 
regards to upgrades, you've talked about how this could last all the way through fiscal – 3Q next year, fiscal next 
year. Do you suspect, though, that upgrade activity is going to be robust in the same way that perpetual license 
sales in this quarter was robust just because they're kind of heading into a deadline of expiration? And as you

said, relative to your expectations that most upgrades of medium, large customers are going to be fiscal 2023 and 
thereafter. Many are going likely to upgrade near-term in order to give them more time to complete their transition 
to the cloud.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Let me take that one. In terms of license revenue, yes, we either have new license activity booked in that 
line or upgraded license activity. And just to remind everyone, we'll be curtailing new license sales in a few days' 
time, February 2 and we'll continue to allow customers to upgrade their licenses, expand the size in essence of 
their current licenses for another year or so.
So, in Q2, it is fair to say that we did see more of that upgrading and new activity than we were previously 
forecasting. And I would say as we have now almost a month of Q3 behind us, that that type of activity has 
continued into Q3 and, of course, we would expect that to mean less activity downstream. I think there'll be 
upgrading activity playing out over the next year or so but it does appear that some of that upgrade activity has 
been pulled in advance of the price increases that will play out next week as well.
So, as you say, not surprising, hard to precisely determine the scale of this pull forward activity on the upgrade 
side and, of course, if you are interested in new licenses, you really have to act very quickly here before those 
new sales fees.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q
Hey, there. Thank you. First off, congrats to Mike and the Jazz on that 10-game win streak, some impressive stuff 
there, too.
James, maybe one on margin. You've consistently noted margins are expected to trend down in the second half 
of the year. We now have the Q3 guide, so just wondering if there's anything else from a seasonal perspective we 
should be cognizant of that could maybe make the shape of the second half look a little different than prior years. 
Just trying to make sure we don't over or under extrapolate what we're seeing into Q4 and beyond on the margin. 
Thank you.

Well, a couple of thoughts there. First of all, just to reiterate what we've been now saying for two or three quarters, 
that through this harder macroeconomic period, we've really been looking to invest purposefully and that 
continues. You saw strong head count growth in the last quarter, good execution by our people teams in that 
regard. We see very significant opportunities in front of us and we want to get after those opportunities and I think 
it's fair to say that Scott and Mike's experience back through the 2008-2009 type downturn – macroeconomic 
downturn was such that it was the right thing to do to invest through that period. And we're doing exactly that 
again this time.
Also, recall I've spoken in the last call or two about some shorter term revenue headwinds, things like the 
introduction of free editions, the fact that we are taking less marketplace revenue as we encourage our app 
system developers to emphasize putting new cloud apps on the marketplace. And we've also taken the decision 
to execute fewer pricing actions, particularly on the cloud side of our business this year versus the past year.
So, while the impact of COVID that we were talking quite a bit about two quarters ago, that is decreasing nicely as 
an impact on our financials. Clearly, we will continue, as I said in an earlier answer, to expect the server business 
lines, the license line and the maintenance line, to continue to contract in terms of there is of change and so forth.
And recall also that we have, in order to encourage our larger enterprise customers, those with over 1,000 users
or so to migrate to the cloud, we're offering them quite substantial loyalty discounts. So we have some revenue 
headwinds. I would describe them as transitory in nature. They're very much really favoring the long-term for a 
short-term headwind. So when you take those factors together, of course, we have seasonal factors like the 
payroll, tax reset that happens at the start of every calendar year, two different things to consider but we've baked 
all of that into the Q3 margin guide. And as we've said elsewhere, we would expect second half margins to be 
down versus the first half margins.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. One of the things that stuck out to me in the shareholder letter was I 
think you pointed out that cloud enterprise adoption is coming in ahead of expectations. I was hoping maybe you 
could just unpack that a little bit. Is that migration that's driving that or are customers naturally upgrading once 
they've started using your cloud solutions for Jira and Confluence and JSM?
And then on the hiring side, are there any specific areas within R&D that you're targeting in the second half that 
we should be on the lookout for?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks, Arjun. I can take both of those. Look, on the enterprise side, I have to say we have two phenomenons 
going on there so I'm not sure which one you're asking about, but let me answer for both.

On the general enterprise customers, we call that the little E enterprise, [ph] the big E (00:22:06) companies. 
We're really pleased with our continued cloud adoption here across all the editions of cloud and that goes from 
Free all the way through Standard, Premium, and the Enterprise edition, big E. You've seen us over the last three 
years through access, through scale, through performance and reliability improvements, and continued 
investment in all manner of compliance standards, continuing to get better and better traction with large 
customers, with enterprise customers, sort of 1,000 seats and more no matter what edition they buy.
Secondly, we did [ph] GA, (00:22:46) our Enterprise edition. So big E during the quarter and I've been very 
pleased with the reaction of the customers there. So we've had a lot of customers in the Early Access Program for 
about the last six months, testing that with us. Again, the Enterprise edition has high levels of compliance and 
security standards, data residency and a whole lot of other features, as well as unlimited instances, so you get 
unlimited scale. So rather than buying one Jira Software instance and a second Jira Software instance, you get –
you pay obviously a higher price but you get unlimited Jira Software instances.
So, that allows you to create and segment your business as very large companies often need to do. You might 
have one for Europe and one for America or you might have one for a certain department and one for a different 
department with different plug-ins, add-ons, exposition to other customers of your own as company, et cetera.
So, I'm very pleased with that adoption so far. Again, it's incredibly early days. It did only [ph] GA'd (00:23:46) 
during the quarter and obviously we're working with all of the Early Access Program customers. The company 
[indiscernible] (00:23:54) to turn them into Enterprise edition customers. There is naturally a flow upwards from 
Standard to Premium to Enterprise as customers grow and deepen their usage and adoption of our licensing 
products and that's part of the ladder that we're trying to build there.
On your second question, no specific callouts in R&D. We continue to invest in hiring across the board and R&D 
across product management, engineering design, and all manner of operations and engineering functions, and 
that's across largely all of our offices. I would remind you of our TEAM Anywhere program where we have 
announced six months ago and continue to announce to staff about hiring in lots more countries in the world and 
lots of parts of the world. And that opens up our R&D pipeline to get that talent hopefully largely no matter where it 
sits in the world to work for Atlassian. And it's been a very successful first six months and we look to continue to 
do [ph] that (00:24:55) in 2021.

Thanks, Robert. It's Scott here and I think just to echo sort of the things that were sort of said earlier, we've seen 
demand higher than we thought but it's still very early days in terms of this both on demand for large customers as 
Mike talked about and also demand for the enterprise product. And so at this stage, there's nothing to say 
different, like we think we're really happy with it and I guess it's playing out as we expected in terms of the 
migration. So there's nothing there that I would change in our forecasts.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Hi. Thanks. Two quick questions. First, just on the data center side, I'm curious, you obviously have these plans 
well-outlined for the server customers. Has outlining those plans and implementing them cause any change in 
terms of how data center customers are thinking about moving to cloud?
And then just a quick second question for James around the gross margin impacts on cloud or just gross margin 
impacts generally, you talked about migration expenses and also just hosting costs. Can you help us understand 
which of those are bigger and how long you expect the migration expenses to be ongoing in COGS?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Walter, it's Scott here. I'll take the first one and then James can get into the details on the second one.
Look, the migration to cloud, whether it's server or DC customer, the majority of our customers have medium and 
long-term plans to move to cloud. And in areas where they're hesitant, it's – the ball's in our court because there 
might be some particular compliance requirements in that geography or something else that they're just waiting on 
us to do. And so the overwhelming demand is there.
Obviously, with customers who had server licenses, they've got three years to make a choice where they land, 
whether they go to cloud or DC and the overwhelming majority we want to move to cloud and they're the 
discussions we're having. Of course, the customers on DC are also looking at the benefits of cloud, not having to 
manage their own upgrades and their hardware, getting the latest versions of our products, the increased 
collaboration that they can have, the low maintenance costs, and they can put their staff on high value activities, 
like those things are the same whether you're coming from server or DC.
James, you want to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, sure. The first thing I'd note is that I am really pleased by how our gross margin has stayed at the level that 
it has as we have been able to build a business, 45% of which is revenue is coming from the cloud. So, I think 
that speaks a lot to the execution of the teams involved there.

But as we have indicated in prior calls, we would expect, particularly as the larger customers, the larger server 
and data center customers move over to the cloud, that we would see increased hosting costs. And we've spoken 
also about how we have added to our support capabilities so that we are ready to help those customers moving 
over to the cloud.
In terms of the timeframe for those support costs, I would expect those to be in place for the next few years, 
consistent with the time frames that we've talked about for our larger customers moving over to the cloud and so I 
would expect some downward pressure on gross margins. But having said that, I really do also want to 
emphasize how we're very focused on continuous cost improvement, whether it's around our usage of compute 
and storage resources or whether it's related to helping our support resources people help our customers so that 
we can do that on a more cost-efficient basis. So that, I hope, gives you a little window as to how we're thinking 
about and operating along the lines of the cost of goods sold part of our business.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. Thank you very much. I guess first off, I'm just kind of wondering, James, how you would characterize the 
revenue and/or deferred revenue benefit from pull forward this quarter as compared to what you saw one year 
prior.
And then just secondly for micro, Scott, just curious to hear how the demand was for data center subscription this 
quarter. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I can take the first part of that question, Gregg. So in terms of maintenance pull forward activity, I would describe 
that in Q2 as really quite modest. Now, remember, last year, that was the primary pull forward quarter and so it 
was a much larger effect in Q2 of fiscal 2020.
Now, what I would expect to play out in Q3 and as I indicated a little earlier, we're already seeing this in the month 
of January is that we'd see more maintenance revenue pull forward activity in Q3 as well. And so what's a little
different this time around? A couple of things really.
First of all, we've given our customers more time, more advanced warning of the price increases. And second, of 
course, not only is there a price increase both for the server and the data center business scheduled to be put into 
place next week, but this time, we're also end of life-ing the server business. We've made that announcement and 
so really what played out more so in Q2 is you can think of it as pull forward at some level. It's a different type of 
pull forward to that that we've seen in prior years because the pull forward has been customers adding to their 
license count, expanding the size of their current licenses ahead of the moves that we're making around server 
end of life.

Data center, relatively modest pull forward there in Q2 as well and again, I would expect there to be pull forward 
activity ahead of the price increases that will apply to data center just as they will apply to server as of February 2.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. That's great. And then just broadly speaking, not referring to any kind of pull forward, but just around kind of 
overall data center demand in the quarter, that would be helpful as well. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. In terms of data center demand, overall, it was a relatively strong quarter. I think part of what we're seeing 
is some of our European partners encouraging some of their customers to move over to the data center ahead of 
these price increases. So, that was a part of what was going on in the subscription revenue line. But as we've 
talked about before, you'll recall that the cloud business is by far the largest part of our subscription revenue 
growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David Hynes
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Q
Hey, guys. Congrats on the results. James, one for you. So there was a comment in the prepared remarks that 
said you're growing increasingly confident in the economics of the Free edition strategy. And look, clearly the top 
of the funnel's really working, right? You already talked about that. But what is it that you're seeing that's giving 
you confidence in the economics of those customers, right? Is it just a lower CAC or are you seeing expansion 
activity that's outperforming your expectations? Again, any color there would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, sure. So, what we do is study very closely each cohort of Free customers that join us each month and we 
track their progression, whether it be as they add to their user accounts and then go beyond the 10 user free limit, 
or whether their progression is before they get to 10 they decide that they really need and appreciate the 
functionality that our standard cloud offering or even our premium cloud offering contains. And so they make that 
switch from free to a paid addition in that way before they get to the 10 user level. So, we watch this, as I say, 
very closely cohort-by-cohort.
And so, while I noted earlier that for fiscal 2021 we would continue to see this as a net revenue headwind, but as 
we watch the cohorts, we see the trend lines are quite clear and that gives us confidence about the future of this

initiative. I think it's an excellent example of how we've taken a long-term view. We've made a decision to take a 
short-term headwind for the long-term benefit down the track. And Mike, were you going to add something?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Thanks, James. DJ, I just wanted to add a couple of small points there, I suppose. We had a lot of 
questions on free. Firstly, I would think of free as much less Thoroughbred and much more Clydesdale in terms of 
how it's going to give us a long-term kind of diesel engine like pull up the hill [ph] for us (00:35:47). And the reason 
for that is it builds a big base of customers and potential customers underneath our business that will mature into 
customers, small and large, over the next many, many years, right? It's a multi-year impact. It's a long-term 
investment that we're aiming at with free. But clearly, we track extremely closely active usage, and I would stress 
that it's the most important metric for us, our people using these free editions. We're giving away free things, but 
people don't use them. So, we spend a lot of time trying to track active usage and working at how we can make 
sure the customers are getting value out of those free editions. We firmly believe philosophically, if they're getting 
value, once they hit that [indiscernible] (00:36:33) stage, they will pay and continue to be our long-term Atlassian 
customers that are marching up that edition hill.
The second part that's really important for the free editions for us is the reduction of friction, specifically in crossflow and cross-sell. So, where you might have, for example, a Jira Software instance that has 50 or 100 people, 
and someone discovers Confluence and its connections to Jira Software in that company, previously they would
have to – if they [ph] won't (00:37:05) the administrator will get out a credit card and pay for a trial of the 
Confluence instance, if that makes sense.
Now, they can start a free trial of Confluence as any of those users. So, their ability to discover new products that 
we have as an existing customer is also increased, right, and the more users we have in product – the first 
product, the more that we have the potential to start trials of second products or free editions alongside with 
anyone in that company. So, our ability to expand and go wall-to-wall is increased by free. Again, I would stress 
it's pretty modest revenue impact given these are all small customers, and we're aiming for that multi-year impact 
as part of our sort of long-term thinking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Hynes
Analyst, Canaccord Genuity LLC Q
Yeah, yeah. Makes perfect sense and built more like a Clydesdale than a Thoroughbred, so I can get behind that 
analogy. Thank you.

J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company Q
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one – I know it's early, but what have you seen in terms of the 
revenue implications when customers migrate from server to cloud? I think you talked about small customers may 
see a little bit of the downtick in revenue capture, mid-market maybe a little bit of an uptick. Any early read on 
revenue conversion and including the potential to upsell, cross-sell during the migration?
And then I'll just draw on my second one, pretty interesting win with ThoughtWorks and the 8,000 users on Trello. 
Is this one of the biggest customers you had adopt Trello from a user account level? And just be curious to hear

maybe kind of why they picked you over the competition and anything else you can share about how you won the 
deal.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I can take the first part of that. In terms of the revenue result that we've seen from the service cloud migrations, I 
would say it's very much tracking along to our expectations. As you pointed out, as you framed the question, we 
gave some, I think, helpful illustrations of how the economics work for small, medium-sized customers. And those 
are generally the ones that are migrating at this point in time. So, yeah, that's tracking pretty consistently with our 
previous discussions of the topic. So, yes, some headwinds on the smaller size at least initially, some modest 
tailwinds on the medium size. Net-net, I wouldn't describe it as a material driver of the revenue in Q2.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And Matt, I can take the Trello question. Look, Trello continues to be early in its monetization journey, as we say 
all the time. Again, a year ago, I believe we released a stat it had past 50 million accounts. So, from the point of 
view of size and scale, the 8,000 users mentioned at ThoughtWorks is relatively small, obviously in comparison to 
the 50 million users of Trello and the 10 million monthly active user number that we possibly released, I believe, at 
Investor Day. That's it from Trello's point of view.
Obviously, we're continuing to learn from the customer base and work on the monetization journeys there in 
Trello, working through its monetization ladder. If you think about its equivalent with free business class and Trello 
Enterprise, it's sort of equivalent to the free standard premium enterprise ladder of editions that we have in Jira 
Software and then Jira Service Management.
8,000 users is not a particularly large enterprise Trello customer, I would say. We certainly have some that are in 
order of magnitude are more larger than that. But it's a very good win for us. I think the reason you see companies 
like Trello using this is ultimately about Trello's flexibility and its capabilities and potential to handle all manner of 
different workloads with very free-form model inside an organization, right? So, its adaptability to lots and lots of
different use cases, and almost anyone in a large company gives Trello huge advantages to solve a whole 
manner of workflow problems for those larger organizations.
And again, as we continue to do in business class and in Trello Enterprise, it gives those organizations that 
control to manage their data, to manage their users and manage the board, whilst keeping that flexibility and freeform nature of Trello in the hands of the users, I guess. And you'll see a lot of exciting things coming up in Trello. 
Again, a small plug for the [ph] team 2021 (00:42:00). If you go to that in a couple months' time, we continue to 
work on really exciting things with Trello and look forward to its future.

Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Happy New Year to everybody. My question is on the Jira Service 
Management. And then I have a quick follow-up. As you see customers, and I know it's still early, migrate from 
Jira Service Desk up to Jira Service Management in the cloud, obviously that product is attacking more things 
within the IT department, agile DevOps, ITSM, work management, any color around sort of the seat expansion 
you're seeing as that product – as people migrate?
And then just a question on the partner network. James, you had mentioned earlier some of the ways you're 
incentivizing the partners with cloud apps and others. You guys are obviously very used to selling with a very light 
touch, but many of your partners are not. And your partners are very active in physical events and stuff. So, I'm 
just curious, as your partners, 600-plus, play a real important role here in this migration, how they're adapting to 
the current environment, and whether you're satisfied with the progress that you see. Thank you, guys, very 
much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Look, on JSM, I would say too early in the release of that particular product to see massive differences with 
JSD having, again, nothing in the market that long in terms of adoption and seat expansion. Obviously, being a 
broader feature offering and having embedded the opportunity functionality and some other things to serve a lot 
more purposes for JSM specifically. We are ambitious, I would say, that we'll see that seat expansion over time, 
whether that's a small customer going from 50 seats to 80 seats or a very large customer going from 10,000 seats 
to 15,000 seats. I think JSM gives us all of that possibility.
And I would stress that we continue to invest very aggressively in that product set. We still have the CMDB 
functionality coming out and continue to invest in automation and all the other things that we've put into the ITSM 
packages over the last little while. One thing I would broaden that though is when we talk about our connections 
to IT, it is broader than just ITSM, right? Think about ITSM as IT teams using JSM for IT. We gain great 
connection trust, a partnership with those IT departments that we then have a lot of other offerings that they can 
take advantage of in terms of that IT department providing functionality to the rest of their organization. And that's 
where you see the strengths of the broader Jira platform.
So, they start to bring in Jira Core. They start to bring other products to provide workflow applications and solve 
lots of different use cases and workflows for other parts of the organization. That's often the IT department 
creating that workflow for the labor department, the marketing department, the finance department, but all within 
that one Jira platform and all within the broader Atlassian platform, and that applies as much to Confluence as it 
does to Jira Core or indeed to Trello and Trello Enterprise. That's about our broader Atlassian seat expansion 
once we've really gained the trust and respect of that IT department and what we can do to help them.
I'll let Scott answer on the partner network.

know, we incentivize them with margins and we also spend a lot of time on training and so forth. And of course, 
we are using training margins and other things to direct our partner network more towards our cloud offerings as

Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continuing and improving business momentum. 
Two quick ones. First, going back to the comment that's been made on the server customers and not expecting 
mid to large – or two-thirds of mid to large customers to migrate until FY 2023 and beyond. I guess, I'm a little 
surprised by that metric just given the incentives that you have in place to push migration. What has been the 
pushback from customers on migrating? Is it just the amount of investment that has to be made? Is it not enough 
incentive? Is it pricing? Is it inertia? And then follow-up, I just wanted to ask about cloud net expansion rates. At 
the Analyst Day, you talked about 121% cloud net expansion rate and 130% for medium and large customers. 
How has that been trending? And is that a metric you plan to disclose maybe annually? Or how should we be 
thinking about that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
[indiscernible] (00:48:04) I'll take the first one, and James can chime in on the second one. For these server 
customers and the large ones migrating from server to cloud, one thing to realize is these instances are missioncritical organizations. They had the CIO of a large technology company talk to us recently and they said, oh, 
there's three or four mission- critical applications in Atlassian – sorry, at this particular company. One of them is 
our ERP, one of them is kind of our sales force automation, and one of them is Atlassian products because we 
wish to stop when these products go down. And so, when these mission-critical applications are there, these 
companies want to plan for it, plan the budget cycles for it, and say, [indiscernible] (00:48:47) today, they 
appreciate all the benefits that they would get. But as a practical matter, it takes a while to plan and migrate this 
sort of systems where they really want to minimize the amount of downtime for their employees.
And so, there's nothing specific there. I would say there's areas that Atlassian will continue to improve on around 
compliance and certification in certain geographies that takes us a while to get those things, and customers are 
working with us to move as we hit those certifications. But there's nothing specific that I [indiscernible] (00:49:18) 
delay really just inertia and the mission criticality of our positions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And then just on the second part of your question, obviously, at the Investor Day, we wanted to dive a little deeper 
in terms of offering some cloud metrics given the importance of the cloud business to our company in the coming 
years. So, yes, we talked about our 35% growth year-over-year. At that point, the net expansion rate, as you say, 
at 121% and that being a larger figure, 130%, for our medium and large-sized customers. And so, as we continue 
along our cloud migration journey, you can expect that we will periodically update those statistics.

Hi, guys. This is Luv Sodha, on for Brent Thill. Congrats again on a nice quarter. Just a couple real quick 
questions for me. One was digging a little bit deeper on the migration, the server to cloud migration, I guess, did 
that have any impact, any negative headwinds on billings or on revenue per se? And then, the second question 
was on the momentum that you've seen with the free cloud versions. Last quarter, I think you noted that you saw

Well, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could provide an update for us on

curious if there's any context you can share in terms of just how – where the growth is coming from and how it's 
growing, whether it's through organic means or is cross-selling really kicking in there.

Scott Farquhar

Great. Thank you. It's Scott here. On the line, James. That is primarily sold to our existing customers, right? This 
is not something where we go in with the sales team and have kind of long customer acquisition sale cycle. These 
are existing customers using our products, predominantly Jira. And I'd say, actually I've got one of many Jiras 
across my organization. We are doing a agile transformation, a digital transformation, and we want better 
executive level understanding, and we want to sort of scale up our agile from what was happening at the 
engineering level all the way through the organization.
And so, what we get is a lot of – our customers calling us up and saying how do we solve this problem? And, of 
course, Align is the exact solution they're looking for. And so I don't think there's anything in terms of really as an 
upsell to our existing customer base. We're very happy with the acquisition and how it works with our customers. 
It is one of many things that helps us with – in our customers' digital transformation, and that is something we talk 
with customers.

It used to be that software teams were – kind of did the right thing. In the departments, they say software is 
mission-critical to every company. We talk to companies that goes every sector and they're really saying that the 
thing they're struggling with is how they'll transform their organization. And in most of these cases, that 
transformation is coming from their software teams. They're actually adopting practices in software and rolling 
them out across the entire organization and benefiting not just here Align, but that benefits Confluence as teams 
need to collaborate more closely across their entire organization.
It's going to benefit some of the new products we've got coming out to address this need. And so, that broad 
trend, I think, is [indiscernible] (00:54:17) conversations at the C-level, CIOs, CTOs, and even CEOs of

Good day, [ph] Quinton (00:55:07). Look, from the – let me answer the pandemic question first. Obviously, as 
more people are working from home, working remotely, changing their work habits, as we like to say, they change 
where they work but they keep how they work consistent in order to allow people to work from lots of different 
locations. As that has happened, you naturally see increased activity and usage in our products because our 
products fundamentally help people looking asynchronously to help teams collaborate. They help you get on the 
same page. Where you might have used the whiteboard beforehand in an office, now you might use a Trello 
board, or if you have remote meetings, I live on Zoom most days. We often start the meetings with Confluence 
pages as a pre-read, right? It's a very – a much more efficient asynchronous method. We will often start our 
meetings with a 10-minute pre-read where someone will send a link to a Confluence page, we will all read it and 
then comments for 10 minutes, and then we will start the meeting.
So, these sort of things are driving, I think, a difference in how people think about working and structuring their 
day in [ph] housework (00:56:21) in broader areas, and leading to activity and usage in our products. Again, it's 
not a sort of a hockey stick jump or a step-change jump, I would say. It's a continued slow march of improvement 
for us as more companies that are already customers have more usage, more days of the week they might use 
our products, et cetera. And that will, I think, in the long-term, lead to expansion. But it's not going to be a stepchange as they also run online and suddenly decide to buy Trello, I guess.

In the broader work management for all space, look, we continue to be bullish. It's a very huge market. Obviously, 
we're very happy with the progress of Trello. Confluence continues to do well at helping us get wall to wall with 
inside customers, and we continue to work in our innovation areas on the new products to target some of those 
trends, I suppose. One example of that is our acquisition. We acquired a company called Halp, which is a digital 
version of ESM, you might say, focused on messaging platforms, so Slack and Microsoft Teams, and providing 
service management within the messaging construct and connecting it back sometimes to something like a Jira 
Service Management in the backend and sometimes just processing all of that messaging within – all of that 
service within the messaging products.
That, again, as you see adoption of things like Slack and Teams during this pandemic due to work-from-home, 
products like Halp will benefit from that because people are increasingly looking for ways to do work within those 
tools, and that's – the leading service provision tool within the Slack ecosystem is now in the Atlassian stable, and 
we continue to work on integrating that into rest of our things.

Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Q
Oh, great. Thank you. And I'll add my congratulations. So, I'll go to a little different topic here. So, in August, you 
announced that the employees could work from home permanently even after the pandemic ends. And obviously, 
your whole solution set really helps with that. But I don't know about you guys, but I find a full Zoom day so 
exhausting. And within our organization, I'm not sure it's the best thing for our employees. I'm just wondering how 
has your thinking on that topic evolved over the last six months.

Scott Farquhar

Scott here. And others can join in if they wanted to add anything. We think of it – we call it TEAM Anywhere, is 
why we've done this, which is really that our employees can work anywhere they want. And if they choose to 
come and work in one of our offices, they can do that. If they choose to work from home, they can do that. And 
that really opens up the talent pool for us. And if we think one of the reasons Atlassian has been successful, I 
think is our heritage outside of Silicon Valley that's allowed us to tap into a amazingly diverse and very loyal talent 
pool, particularly in Australia. And so I think that's been a closeout success. And I'm really excited about able to 
tuck into that around the world.
I know myself, yeah, a day full of Zoom meetings aren't that great. But what we've found is that the many 
employees value the lack of a commute, the ability to spend more time with friends and family, the reintegration of 
local communities around where they live. I know many of our executive team has moved from the center of cities 
to somewhere nearby to take advantage of kind of those areas. And so two hours back from a commute gives you 
a lot of freedom and flexibility to spend time with family or exercise or other things there.
I'd remind our employees that we aren't really in a steady state there, that we are working from home in the 
middle of a pandemic, and that depends on what the world will look like. When you can, your kids are back at 
school and you can travel into the office. And we are building our policies for that world and, God willing, that will

happen this year. We'll see the vaccine roll out and hopefully we can move into a more normal state. So, it is 
something we spend a lot of time thinking about. I don't think we'll get it all right. But like everything Atlassian, we 
continually try and improve – that Clydesdale spirit is continuing to make relentless improvement. And so, you'll 
see that here as well.

Great. Thanks for that perspective.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frederick Havemeyer
Analyst, Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Q
Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. I'm really curious about your perspective on this. Businesses are 
planning for their IT remote-type work – sorry, remote work by designing this new kind of IT paradigm of hybrid or 
remote work. How are you seeing the evolution in your funnel? And what are companies looking for in terms of 
software that can support more agile work cycles or team alignment within this remote work environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And Scott here. It's interesting, in terms of remote work by design. There's a great quote, which is, the future is 
here, it's just unevenly distributed. And I think if I went back pre-pandemic, you would find that like there were a 
large number of our customers already working in this fashion. It's heavily weighting on digital tools to share 
information across their organization, already reaping the benefits of [ph] asynchronous (01:02:20) 
communication, more work that is tracked kind of in Confluence rather than meetings.
And so, in many cases, what we're seeing with the pandemic is the sort of whole world catching up. Many people 
were already using Zoom on a day-to-day basis, and everyone else is now seeing it. We're seeing many 
customers who are using Jira and Confluence, and our agile products, Trello, already been used in many places. 
So, I don't think there's been a huge change. I guess we've always, at Atlassian, catered to the vanguard of 
people and how they're working. And obviously, just some new things we're thinking about with this, but it doesn't 
mean a sort of step-change in sort of how products work.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. At the Analyst Day a couple months ago, 
you guys talked about strength in large deals. I was wondering if you could double click on that, and how recent 
performance is there in this quarter. And second, just any more color around – what would you say is the biggest

surprise you've seen in terms of customer behavior since the October announcement of the server and the sale? 
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
So, in terms of large deals, we tend to update that statistic each year. I would say that we continue to execute in a 
way kind of consistent with the trends that were laid out in the last stance that we laid out at Analyst Day. And in 
terms of the second part of your question, surprises, in terms of how customers have reacted post the Server 
EOL announcement, I would really say that I think our team prepared just fabulously for that announcement. And 
that planning, the thought that went into that announcement has paid off, because I would say that customers are, 
obviously, thinking hard about their options and so forth, the right timing for them to make a move and so forth. 
But really, that's very consistent with how we had analyzed and planned for this announcement. Scott or Mike, 
would you add anything to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
No. I think you said it really well, James. Like, we're thoughtful, long-term focused, and you've seen from 
Atlassian whether it's free or migration to cloud or the product portfolio we build, like, we really just take a longterm focus with [indiscernible] (01:05:27) volatility month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but most of the time Mike 
and I don't spend really much time on pull forward or anything like that. We're spending our time thinking about
the future of our companies and customers in the cloud. So, yeah, and again, I mean, the last question, I say 
thank you to all of you for being on with the journey and I appreciate it. And I think that's the last question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Yes. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks.

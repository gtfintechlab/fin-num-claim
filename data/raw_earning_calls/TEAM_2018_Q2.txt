Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
Ian Lee: 
Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian’s Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. On 
the call today we have Atlassian’s Co-Founders and CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, 
our Chief Financial Officer, Murray Demo, and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and our shareholder letter with our financial results and 
commentary for our second quarter of Fiscal Year 2018. These items are also posted on the Investor 
Relations section of Atlassian’s website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there is also an 
accompanying presentation and data sheet available. 
We’ll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A. 
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance 
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements 
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking 
statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s 
beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. 
In addition, during today’s call we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial 
measures are in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS 
financial measures versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS 
measures used by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is 
available in our earnings release, our shareholder letter and our updated Investor Data Sheet on our IR
website. 
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the Company’s financial results is 
included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the 
section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Forms 20-F and 6-K. 
I will now turn the call over to Scott for his brief opening remarks before we move to Q&A. 
Scott Farquhar: 
Good afternoon. Thanks everyone for joining today. We had a strong close to calendar 2017. This quarter 
we grew revenue 43% year-over-year and generated over $67 million of free cash flow. We now have 
more than 112,000 customers in total, and after 4,825 net new customers during the quarter. This is the 
most net new customers we’ve ever added in a single quarter and another milestone on our way to 
serving the Fortune 500,000. 
We saw solid demand across all our deployment options, Cloud, Server and Data Center. We’re 
continuing to expand with customers of all sizes and across numerous industries and geographies.
Alongside the growth of our business, Mike and I are both humbled and excited by the rapid expansion of 
the vibrant ecosystem surrounding Atlassian. There are thousands of developers and vendors outside of 
Atlassian who are creating apps that make our core products even more powerful and our customers 
even happier.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
Today our Marketplace vendors offer more than 3,500 apps, and during the quarter, the Atlassian 
Marketplace surpassed $350 million in total lifetime sales since its inception in 2012. In our shareholder 
letter we highlight three of our vendors who are helping to drive this growth. 
Our developers and vendors combined with our global customer and partner base form the foundation of 
the thriving Atlassian community. We’ll soon be going on the road on our first Atlassian team tour to 
spend more time with our community, to unveil new product updates, share the latest in team practices 
and discuss the future of teamwork. We’ll kick this tour off on February 8th in Amsterdam and then cross 
the globe with a total 10 stops on three continents.
Before we move to Q&A, I’d like to say a heartfelt thanks to our CFO Murray Demo as this is his last 
earnings call with us before James Beard takes over as our new CFO. It’s been a privilege to work with 
Murray over the past years, both in his capacity as CFO and as an Atlassian board member before that. 
We wish him the best. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for Q&A.
Operator:
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, 
then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before 
pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. 
Our first question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Ittai Kidron:
Thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter. A couple of things from me. First of all on Stride, it’s 
still in limited access, early access. Can you give us some color on the feedback you’ve been getting from 
customers? What are some of the good things and bad things you’re hearing from customers? How soon 
will we see it generally available in the Marketplace?
Scott Farquhar:
Thanks for the question. It’s Scott here. You’re right. Stride, we had an early access program and we put 
a waitlist in, we had so much demand for the product. The feedback we’ve had so far has been 
overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are really liking it. They’re liking the differentiated features and 
the fact that Stride allows you to get work done and also is a whole communications platform rather than 
just a chat product, so they’re giving us great feedback about that.
The differentiated features, actions and decisions which we put in in order to help people progress work. 
We’re getting a lot of great feedback around that. In the coming months we’ll move it from a early access 
sort of waitlist program through to general availability, but we don’t have the exact release date at this 
time.
Ittai Kidron:
Got it. Second question. Murray, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on a very nice customer 
addition count. Is there any color you could give around that and what product areas it was stronger than 
what you thought, what areas were maybe a little bit softer? Then also just one question on the tax rate.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
Given the change in the tax rate here in the U.S., how should we think about modeling your non-IFRS tax 
rate going forward?
Murray Demo:
Hey Ittai, it’s Murray. I’ll turn it over to Jay to talk about the customer count, and then when he’s done we’ll 
come back and talk about the tax rate. 
Jay Simons:
Just quickly, Ittai, obviously we’re really pleased with the adds in the quarter. There was pretty strong 
demand kind of universally across all products and platforms, so no real call-outs to highlight. Net 
customer adds does move around a bit quarter to quarter, and so even though we’re really proud of the 
nearly 5K we added this quarter, it kind of a drop in the bucket around the Fortune 500,000 that we’re 
chasing.
Murray Demo:
In terms of the tax rate, a couple of things to kind of point out makes us a little bit different. First of all, our 
fiscal year, half the year is at the 35 rate in the U.S.; the other half is at 21, so we’re not like other 
calendar companies where they’re starting the calendar 2018 where you get a full year of benefit of the 
rate. 
Secondly, we are a U.S. and Australian company, and so you’ve got a blend that way. 
When you put all that together for Fiscal 18, so the second half of the year for us, we’re not seeing a 
whole lot of benefit. That’s going to show up in Fiscal 19 when we get a full year of the U.S. benefit and 
other activities that we’ve got is where we’ll see that.
Also, just since you brought up the tax rate, I just want to comment on one thing regarding our Q3 and Q$ 
EPS, our Q3 EPS target, our implied Q4 EPS target and the full year. We’ve got quite a swing in the tax 
rate that’s embedded in the EPS targets for Q3 and implied for Q4. It’s strictly from IFRS. The full year, 
nothing is changing. It’s just under IFRS it’s quite different from GAAP. We’re just not in a position to 
smooth it out like you can in GAAP and we get these wild swings. There’s nothing going on there other 
than just the way IFRS calculates it, and so the focus should be more on what our full year rate that’s sort 
of implied in the EPS targets and not to get too focused on the Q3 EPS and implied tax rate and the Q4 
rate.
Ittai Kidron:
Is there a way then to think about what a full-year Fiscal 19 tax rate could be? Some sort of a bracket 
range around that?
Murray Demo:
We’re not providing any targets for Fiscal 19 but we’d expect to see a lower rate as we go into 19, and 
we’ll be able to provide more details on that as we get to the point of giving our Fiscal 19 guidance.
Ittai Kidron:
Got it. Good luck, guys.

Murray Demo:
Thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz:
Thank you. Congratulations everyone on a good all around quarter as well. Scott, you said that Cloud, 
Server and Data Center all did well, but over the course of the last six months or so, have you seen any 
change with respect to the mix of new or existing customers adopting your Cloud offerings, or would you 
say that that’s been stable overall?
Scott Farquhar:
Gregg, good question. As we’ve seen for a long time, the trend is towards Cloud, clearly, from us and 
other companies you see. Nothing has really changed over the last quarter. We still continue to see 
strength in Cloud, Server and Data Center. There hasn’t been some particular inflection point and we 
think there’s still a long business behind the firewalls, server deployments, for a long time.
Gregg Moskowitz:
Okay, perfect. Then just a question for Murray. I’m wondering if you could help us, parse for us the 
impact, if you will, to Q2 billings and revenue from any early maintenance renewals from customers who 
perhaps wanted to get ahead of the Jan 1 price increase. Part of the reason for my asking for the 
question is also to sort of make sure the Street has some help with respect to modeling the March quarter 
appropriately as well. Thanks.
Murray Demo:
Gregg, that’s a good question. That’s obviously something we were very focused on as well, is trying to 
understand any of this, if you want to call it pull-forward bookings that’s related to the change in pricing. 
One of the things that we have learned through the change in pricing on Server but also in Cloud is that 
the customers that are the most sensitive to price, they tend to take action fairly quickly around the time of 
the announcement, and what we saw is actually we probably saw even a little more of this sort of pullforward bookings in the first quarter than we did in the second quarter because we announced it in the 
first quarter. What we also saw that was a little bit different was some of our customers chose to go multiyear, and you can see that on the balance sheet under the long-term deferred revenue. They’re locking in 
with us for a number of years. They made a decision they wanted to go ahead and buy server 
maintenance revenue for multi-year up front and we saw some of that. But as you got later into the 
second quarter, it seemed to be all kind of behind us and it was more pronounced in the sort of 
September/October timeframe is where we saw it. We’re pleased to obviously have that but obviously 
longer term we’d rather have had them renew under the new pricing because that one in theory will be a 
little bit of less revenue for us over longer term, but we’re always happy to see customers that are 
committed to us for the longer term.
Gregg Moskowitz:

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
That’s great. Murray, have you seen any uptick in churn following the Cloud and Server price increases 
just over the past few months or so?
Murray Demo:
What we saw there was in the first couple of months, which was Q1 which we talked to all of you about 
during that call and everything, is that we expected some customers to downgrade from being call it a 
customer on monthly and kind of dropped to the 10-user level where they could get the starter pricing. 
Some went to annual, and we had factored all that into our calculations. All that kind of activity, it kind of 
went away as we got into the second quarter, and part of the reason why we saw stronger customer 
count is actually lower churn in Cloud. Our customers that were sensitive to price, they did what they 
wanted to do around that, but it’s really been, as Jay said, well received. It’s behind us. We continue to be 
a leader, obviously, in low price, high value and so it was very successful. We’re on track with the 
guidance we provided around the change in the Cloud pricing of low single digits for the year. That’s right 
on track. At this point after five months, we’re very pleased with the results we’ve seen and how highly 
correlated it is to all the modeling that we had done in advance.
Gregg Moskowitz:
That’s very helpful. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator:
The next question comes from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Bhavan Suri:
Hey guys, can you hear me okay?
Jay Simons:
Yes, Bhavan. 
Bhavan Suri:
Great. Thanks and congrats. I guess two questions, one for maybe Jay and the guys here. We’ve seen 
sort of continued momentum around service desk, Jira Service Desk. You guys certainly talked about it, 
talked about it last quarter a lot. I guess when you think about that and you think about some of the larger 
deals you’re seeing there and you think about the main competitor there, what do you think in terms of is 
the gap there? When Jira was early on there was this sort of gap with Rally; no one really talks about 
Rally any more. Comparing that to Jira Service Desk and some of the competitors there, and obviously 
investments there, do you think there’s a material gap and how far behind those guys do you think you 
might be from an enterprise deployment perspective of Jira Service Desk versus, say, ServiceNow or 
some of the other smaller guys like (Inaudible) or whatever?
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Hey Bhavan, this is Mike. I can take that. Obviously we remain really excited about Jira Service Desk, 
right? It is, as you mentioned, one of our fastest growing product areas. As we said I think last quarter, it’s 
passed 25,000 organizations now so we’re really happy about how it’s coming along.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
I do think it’s pretty differentiated to the competition, specifically in the way we think about service teams. 
It does a great job in IT and Technical teams, but we see a much broader blue ocean in the service teams 
within an organization, much more focus on the broader business team, so Legal, Finance, HR and all the 
other teams that are effectively servicing other groups within an enterprise. I think that’s the main 
differentiation. That flow from a philosophy into the product and into everything else. 
At the same time, one of the other differentiations of Jira Service Desk obviously is bringing our 
ecosystem to bear. You’ve seen it. It’s a great quarter for the Marketplace and the ecosystem is really 
humming along nicely inside Jira Service Desk, providing extensions, use cases and useful value in 
different parts of a business.
Bhavan Suri:
Mike, that’s helpful. Thanks. Then one quick follow-up here on R&D. You guys have sort of talked about 
R&D allocation. You’ve talked about a fair amount of effort re-platforming for the Cloud, the team 
platform, mobile, but as you think about optimizing R&D and obviously that’s really the biggest expense 
you guys have, how do you guys think about that through ’18? Then, I’m not asking about ’19 because I 
know Murray will shoot me down about ’19 targets, but over the next three to five years, sort of the 
optimization allocation to R&D, just sort of how you guys think about that would be helpful. Thank you.
Murray Demo:
In terms of R&D, Bhavan, yeah, we’re not talking about ’19 right now, but we’re going to continue to 
invest. We just think we’ve got such a large market opportunity here. There’s so many things we can do. 
We’re going to continue to invest. It’s been one of the clear differentiators and competitive advantages 
that we have in the Marketplace and we’re going to continue to invest and try to drive revenue growth and 
get margin expansion through leverage. At this point, there’s nothing that—we’re going to look to optimize 
everywhere we can in terms of being efficient, but we are going to continue to invest for the long term. 
That’s been what Scott and Mike and the team have done here for 15 years and we’re not going to 
change that approach. 
Bhavan Suri:
Got it. Thanks guys. Congrats again. Thank you.
Murray Demo:
Thank you.
Operator: 
The next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
John DiFucci:
Thank you. I have a question for Murray and it’s kind of a follow-up to Gregg’s question, Murray. It’s trying 
to get some help in modeling this going forward. 
No matter how you look at the numbers, they look strong, but in this quarter billings growth, and even 
more importantly current billings growth, just looking at the change in short-term deferred revenue, it was

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
about equal to revenue growth. Whereas in the recent past, like frankly over the past year and a half, 
billings growth has been greater than revenue growth. I’m just trying to figure it out. You’re in the low 40s 
percentage growth, which is pretty amazing given your scale, but should we start to see that—I mean the 
guidance implies that growth comes down a little bit, but frankly, the guidance has implied that for a while 
now. When we’re looking forward, just so we’re sort of prepared, it seems to me that with that, it’s sort of 
an indication that we will start to see the growth still be very meaningful but not continue to accelerate like 
it has, the revenue growth has over the last year and a half. Does that make sense?
Murray Demo:
It’s a good question. There’s a lot of things going on there. I think if you look at the first quarter and the 
second quarter, one of the advantages we’ve had is, is that we’re getting bookings and we’re getting 
revenue from Trello that didn’t exist in the prior year. As we go into the second half of this year now, we’re 
going to have the Trello compare. Obviously there’s no purchase accounting haircut on bookings, it’s just 
on revenue, so in Q3/Q4, we’ve got the Trello bookings from last year that we’re now going to be 
comparing to. So, we’ve got some of that.
We also have when these price increases kind of work their way through, we’ll see some of that where 
the bookings and revenue can shift. 
And in the first quarter, we just had an easier compare. Q1 of ’17 was a tougher quarter as we had talked 
before, just because we believe, you know, the Olympics and the Euro soccer and all that stuff that was 
going on in Q1 of ’17, we saw just a little softer on the bookings side and then we came back stronger in 
the second quarter of ’17, so that gave us a more typical compare in Q1 of ’18.
As we go into the second half of the year, a big part of what you’re seeing is, is the compare relative to 
having Trello now in the base. 
Over the longer term, obviously there’s going to be the law of large numbers, etc., that we’ll be facing like 
any company, but as far as here in the second half, it’s the Trello compare that is causing some of this, it 
looks like the growth rate isn’t what it was in the first half.
John DiFucci:
Great. That’s helpful. If I could just a quick, follow-up, and I know it’s really early; you’re a few weeks into 
the quarter, but have you seen any change in business momentum? I know you have a pretty linear 
quarter, which is really unique in the software space. Have you seen any change in business momentum 
over the last few weeks after the price increase?
Murray Demo:
Well, again, if we look at the Cloud, the price increases went in around July 31st. That’s well past us. On 
Server we had, John, as you know, on license it was October 1st, and now maintenance is on Jan 1, and 
business in general, the environment is good. We’re not really commenting specifically but so far through 
the end of December we’re quite pleased and there’s nothing has changed in the tone of business since. 
John DiFucci:
Got it, okay. Thanks a lot. Nice job, guys.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
Thanks, John.
Operator:
The next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael Turits:
Hey guys, two questions. First, I know you said that you did well across all deployment models but can 
you comment and drill down a little bit on Data Center and the Stack bundle, and talk about how much of 
a shift there might be there, how successful, and how much of a benefit that has been to billings? Then I 
have another question.
Jay Simons:
Hey Michael, it’s Jay. It just continues to do well; we’re pleased with it. No outsized contribution relative to 
past quarters. There continues just to be strong demand in the server base for customers largely with 
more than 500 employees that are looking to move to data centers that provides better high availability 
and an architecture to support the kind of scale. 
The other indication in Data Center growth we’ve talked about in the past is I think it shows kind of the 
broader standardization as companies move from Technical teams to IT to Business teams. 
Stack is kind of a small part of removing purchase friction. For companies that want to buy all those Data 
Center family at once, Stack makes the purchase of all Data Center family of products at once easier. 
There’s going to be a handful of customers that do that. A lot of them are going to start maybe with Jira
and then expand to Confluence and then expand with Jira Service Desk, etc.
Finally, the channel is a really important contributor to Data Center growth. They work with a lot of our 
larger customers and tend to help them move from the original server deployment to the Data Center 
ones.
Michael Turits:
Thanks. Thanks, Jay. My follow-up perhaps is for you as well. As you’re getting more adoption across the 
enterprise, obviously you’re sticking with your frictionless model, but is there any change at all in go-tomarket as you have to deal more with potential ISIT, with procurement? Obviously you’ve got the 
enterprise advocates. How is that transition going?
Jay Simons:
It’s not really a transition. We’ve had enterprise advocates in the business for a couple of years and there 
isn’t a material change in the model at all. We described it in detail at the Investor Day. The focus for the 
Company is just to make purchasing easy for customers, especially at scale, and so we do that by 
building a product that people can try on their own by publishing pricing so they don’t have to call us and 
ask us what it is. By creating service teams like the enterprise advocates and then through our channel to 
help them when they need extra help if there’s things that they can’t do on their own. I think the results of 
the business I think is validation that that’s working and we’re really pleased with how it’s going.

Okay, great. Thanks, Jay, and great quarter everybody.
Scott Farquhar:
Thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Heather Bellini:
Great. Thank you. A lot of the questions have been answered but I just wanted to know if you could share 
with us a little bit about the momentum you’ve been seeing with Trello and kind of how you’ve seen that 
evolve since the acquisition, and the type of customer synergies you might be seeing and kind of 
leveraging the vast installed base that you guys already had.
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Thanks, Heather. It’s Mike. Trello continues to power along and we’re really happy with its progress. As 
we’ve said previously, we’re not even at the end of Year 1 in terms of an integration program with the 
business, the team, etc. Our main goal is maintaining the momentum of the product and business that 
Trello already is before we look at the opportunities potentially in combining the customer bases. We 
have a lot of time to go through in continuing to do that. 
We’ve been pretty happy in how the Trello team fits with the culture of the broader Atlassian family, and I 
think on all sides it’s been a great success so far.
The one thing we’re doing, we’re certainly not standing still, so the product of Trello has had a number of 
improvements over the last period of time, and if you look in the shareholder letter you can see that we’ve 
officially introduced Trello to the Japan market as a single example in November. We have a localized 
product and some partnerships and some marketing and things that we did down there, which is a good 
example of something that Atlassian brings to the table. We already had the office there in Yokohama so 
we could use that as a leverage point to get Trello into the Japanese market, but a lot of the things that 
you talk about are still ahead of us.
Heather Bellini:
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Sanjit Singh:
Thank you very much and a happy new years to the team. Murray, maybe I wanted to start with gross 
margins. That has been trending down for several quarters now, and I’m sure that’s related to the 
accelerated depreciation. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about gross margin going

forward? Is there a quarter when gross margin starts to plateau after we get through this accelerated 
depreciation phase?
Murray Demo:
Yes, Sanjit. In terms of the gross margin, that’s correct. We’ve been going through a transition here where 
we’ve been accelerating the depreciation on the server equipment that we run in our own data centers. 
Obviously we’re really excited about the fact that what the engineering team has done to get us to our 
new cloud platform. We’re actually reassessed that need for the remaining equipment and its useful life 
and it’s going to be fully depreciated through the third quarter, which is what we’re in now, and will come 
to a close. That’s kind of depressing the gross margin here in the third quarter and then it’s going to—the 
implied numbers are in the fourth quarter it gets better.
As we kind of go on from there, it’s just going to be obviously we’re going to have a little bit of a benefit in 
’19 versus ’18 because we don’t have the accelerated depreciation, but at the same time our business is 
moving to the cloud and the cloud runs at a lower gross margin like in all the other SaaS companies 
where we have to incur the cost of hosting the application, servicing those applications. As you look at 
‘19, it’ll just sort of be a little bit of a battle between the relief we get on the accelerated depreciation 
versus more transition to the cloud.
Then as we kind of go on from there, as that transition continues, that secular trend moving to the cloud, 
there’ll just sort of a be a modest probably impact on lowering the gross margin over time as that 
transition goes to cloud.
We are obviously very pleased with our overall gross margins, where we stand today. The Server 
business actually has very good gross margins; it’s not going away over night. It continues to be very 
strong and you can see that in our results just this past quarter. That’s also been a good lift for us from a 
gross margin standpoint.
Sanjit Singh:
Great. That’s super helpful. The follow-up is on the HipChat customer base. Any sort of details on how 
they’re thinking about potentially upgrading to Stride or maybe sticking with their deployment, or even 
potentially moving off to a comparative solution? What have the conversations been like with the HipChat 
customer base and how do you see their deployment plans moving forward?
Scott Farquhar:
Good question. It’s Scott here. We recommend all of the HipChat customers in the cloud upgrading to 
Stride and we actually have really strong migration paths for all those customers. It’s a very seamless 
process and we’re already migrating customers from one to the other. We’re seeing great excitement 
amongst the HipChat base for all the new features and the sort of change in the product when they move 
from HipChat to Stride, so that’s going really well.
We continue to sell HipChat behind the firewall for those customers that want something that they can 
deploy inside their network.

In terms of getting them migrated, getting the Cloud customers migrated over, is there any sort of 
timeframe that we should think about? Would that happen over the next two quarters or a year? Any 
timeframe that makes sense?
Scott Farquhar:
At this stage we’re not publicly stating a timeframe. We have all the pieces in place to gracefully move 
customers but we want to be sensitive to their timetables to make sure they have a great experience, so 
we haven’t got a sort of definitive end date on that at the moment.
Sanjit Singh:
Got it. Thank you very much, Scott.
Operator:
The next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Richard Davis:
Hey, thanks. Most of the stuff has been asked but basically one of the questions I got from investors was 
last year you bought Trello so you obviously added a bunch of people but you did pay a high revenue 
multiple. What is your opinion right now of kind of the valuation expectations for possible M&A targets and 
how does that inform your interest in future purchases? Thanks.
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Hi Richard. It’s Mike again. We obviously don’t comment on any targets or valuations of where other 
people sit at. I think there’s a very complicated science in working out what works for both parties at a 
given time in a given market and for a given opportunity.
Again, we continue to use M&A as one of a series of tools that we have over the last 15 years to build the 
business, both on small sort of tuck-in acquisitions through to obviously even more transformative ones 
like Trello, and we keep scanning the market that’s out there.
Again, we’ve been very efficient stewards of capital over time. I think our record speaks for itself there 
and we intend to continue to be so.
Richard Davis:
Super. Thank you.
Operator:
The next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Research. Please go ahead. 
Jonathan Kees:
Hi. Great, thanks for taking my questions and my congrats also for the quarter. Just wanted to ask a 
couple of questions, one being on more strategic part. You’ve talked about before your land and expand 
strategy with corporate customers. I’m sure the bulk of it, like with this quarter, is still the traditional Jira

and Confluence and selling them more usage and additional products. Just curious if during the quarter if 
you’ve seen any change in terms of the greenfield for Service Desk or even Bitbucket and HipChat in 
terms of those sales, and then even the other way where they are selling up to Jira and Confluence?
Scott Farquhar:
Jonathan, it’s Scott here. Our business has always depended on sort of landing and expanding from a lot 
of different products, and so you’re right we’ve landed with Jira and Confluence but Bitbucket lands a 
large number of customers as does Trello, as does HipChat and Stride. The cross-sell paths aren’t sort of 
linear. There are sort of other companies out there in the market that have one very clear land product 
and then they expand and have sort of tuck-in add-ons on the back of that. We haven’t got that. We’re 
actually sort of lucky that we’ve got a large number of areas that we land with.
When Stride comes on the market, we see that lands new customers. Obviously the acquisition of Trello 
helps us land more customers than we were previously, but there’s been nothing over the last sort of 
period of time where I’d say there was an inflection point on landing with one particular product or a 
change in the mix. It’s just that all the products get better at landing customers as we add more features 
and a we have more brand awareness in the Marketplace.
Jonathan Kees:
Great, that was helpful. My last question is more of a housekeeping. You have in the past given a count 
for like Trello customers, even a Service Desk count. You just referenced last quarter’s count of greater 
than 25,000. I’m sure an updated number would be greater than 25,000. Is it greater than 30,000? For 
Trello, would be curious what the latest number would be. I’m sure it’s greater than 25 million which is 
what you referred to last quarter. You guys have been great in terms of providing those numbers in the 
past and obviously you’re proud in terms of the performance. You have been happy with the 
performance, and so any updated numbers in terms of that would be great. 
Mike Cannon-Brookes:
Hi Jonathan. We don’t have any updated numbers to either of those two. We continue to be happy with 
the performance of both. Again, the 25 million users in Trello is from Summit last year so it’s only three or 
four months ago, so. 
Ian Lee:
Jonathan, it’s Ian. Let me just clarify that 25,000 is organizations, not customers.
Jonathan Kees:
Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification. Good luck guys.
Murray Demo:
Thank you.

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
Patrick Walravens:
Great, thank you. Let me add my congratulations. I would love to drill down a little more on Bitbucket and 
to understand, you know, you guys like to talk about sort of the philosophy and the differentiation, and in 
this case maybe sort of the philosophy and the differentiation when compared to GitHub and how the 
whole open source development plays into that.
Scott Farquhar:
Yes, great question. Bitbucket has millions of users that use it on a monthly basis. It’s a very, very popular 
code hosting service. Years ago we chose to differentiate from some competitors by really focusing on 
where you go to do work as opposed to sort of host open source projects. That differentiation actually 
flows through to numbers of the features that we put into the product that make it appealing to businesses 
who want to do work around security features, around performance, around even just how teams are 
organized in the products.
The integration with Jira continues to be a big differentiator for that product as well because people don’t 
choose these products in isolation and one of Atlassian’s great strengths is not only do we integrate with 
ourselves and our competitors but as we add more products and as we sort of have more of a solution for 
our customers, they increasingly look to us to provide more of their solutions for their problems. Obviously 
the fact that it’s an Atlassian product and works with the rest of our products is a big differentiator as well. 
Patrick Walravens:
Great, thank you. Then if I could sneak one more in, in my model you’re about three quarters away from 
hitting that billion-dollar run rate, which has been an oddly difficult hurdle for a lot of software companies, 
and I’m just wondering how you guys think about that. Is it sort of a totally artificial barrier and you can 
just keep doing exactly what you’re doing, or have you been thinking hard about how we scale through 
that?
Scott Farquhar:
It’s Scott again. Years and years ago—we’ve always had big ambitious goals for Atlassian. When we 
were I think a handful of people in a shared office we’d set a goal of having 50,000 customers and that 
took us about 10 years to get there. That was a really big celebration. We’re setting goals for active users 
and so forth out in the future as well, and so revenue goals are really nice and I think it’s great for us to be 
up there with a very few select companies that have reached that milestone, if and when we do cross that 
milestone, but for us the things that get our staff engaged and get me and Mike excited about the impact 
you have on the world, which is often around usage and size of the customer base versus a dollar metric.
Patrick Walravens:
Okay, great. Thank you.

Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. The next question comes from Nate

Atlassian Corporation Plc – Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call, January 18, 2018
Hi guys. On Atlassian Home is sounds like you’ve gotten good feedback so far, and I realize it’s early but 
have you seen any behavior like increasing engagement or more multiproduct usage among customers 
that are participating in that beta?
Scott Farquhar:
It’s Scott again. Just on Atlassian Home, we’re still very early in that rollout, and we’ve been doing tests 
with customers and we do see great results, but not at a stage I’d be prepared to sort of share them 
publicly. We’re still early in the rollout of Home across all of our products, so while we’re seeing a lot of 
engagement on a one-to-one product basis, we’re still early in the multiproduct engagement cycle. 
We have done some experiments in that area and we’re seeing some great improvements to how we’re 
cross-selling or cross-promoting products, but nothing I’d could give you concrete numbers on at this 
stage apart from just being very happy with those results.
Nate Cunningham:
Thanks, Scott.

Seeing no further questions, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the

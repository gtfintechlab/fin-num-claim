MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of 
Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the 
Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Sonefeldt
Vice President-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian's second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. It's great to join 
this incredible team. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike 
Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our second quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's 
website. On our IR site, we've also posted a supplemental presentation and data sheet. During the call, we'll 
make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements 
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only of the date such 
statements are made. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial 
results are included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including 
the section titled Risk Factors in our most recent 20-F and Quarterly Report on Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures 
are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures 
versus their nearest IFRS equivalents and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used 
by other companies.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, our 
shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full 
question up-front so that we can more easily move to the next person.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks.

Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today and for your continued support. Q2 was a strong quarter. We grew 
revenue by 37% year-over-year and posted record levels of profitability and free cash flow. We also added over

5,000 net new customers during the quarter and now have well over 164,000 customers. During Q2, we made 
continued progress against our long-term goals. We are constantly focused on long-term opportunities, including 
how we help teams collaborate through our products, how we win in large markets, and how we continue to scale 
a durable business.
This quarter's product highlights connect to those themes. We passed $1 billion in lifetime revenue through the 
Atlassian Marketplace. Driving customer value through a large developer ecosystem has been one of our 
continued long-term focuses. The launch of Forge, our new cloud app development platform, reinforces the value 
we create for customers by making it easier and cheaper to developers to build cloud apps on the Atlassian 
platform.
We do have bittersweet news to share this quarter. Our longtime president, Jay Simons, has decided to leave 
Atlassian in July for new adventures. Jay helped us pioneer our unique, low-friction, customer-centric business 
model over the last decade. He's also built an incredible sales and marketing leadership team to continue to drive 
that growth.
Jay is a permanent part of our culture and while we have a few months left to ensure a smooth transition, we'll 
miss his presence in the office daily. We provide more detail on these announcements and many other updates in 
our shareholder letter that we issued earlier today.
And with that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with 
Cowen and Company. Go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company Q
Great. Thanks. James, I wanted to ask about a comment on the shareholder letter about the pull forward effect 
and you did mention that you pulled forward from second half 2020 and fiscal 2021 but you did raise the fiscal 
year guidance by more than your Q2 beat. So, just trying to get a little sense of where that shows up. I suspect 
maybe more on the bookings and deferred and billings side. If you could give us any color on how to think about 
the impact to billings growth as we move into the second half, that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Well, first of all, I'd like to start by saying how pleased we were with the overall level of demand right across 
the organization across our products, across our deployment options and indeed, across our geographies. And 
so, yes, there was some pull forward activity that played out in Q2 but even with that, we were pleased to be able 
to record the revenue result versus our original guide. And in terms of the guide for the full year, yes, you're quite 
right. We were able to add both the degree to which we beat in the quarter, as well as some additional money and 
that's really reflective of our overall level of confidence in the top line environment.
So, in terms of the billings part of your question, the first thing I'd really like to also remind you of is as we've 
talked quite a few times in the past, we really focus on revenue as our primary top line measure and that's

because our model is really quite different to that of the typical enterprise software company. You'll recall what a 
significant proportion of our business is booked on an annual cycle, either maintenance or annual subscriptions 
and in fact, our cloud business recalled more than three quarters of that is recorded on a monthly subscription. So 
that very much illustrates our orientation towards the revenue line.
That said, clearly the deferred revenue accounts give you a sense for the degree of the pull forward in addition to 
what I would put at about a $10 million beneficial effect at the revenue line. If you look at the deferred revenue 
lines and contrast historical activity sequentially quarter-to-quarter, you can pull out that there's a pull forward 
benefit in the aggregate of approximately $50 million, 5-0. And I would expect that to most primarily reflect that 
revenue would be drawn away from Q3.
But the long-term deferred revenue results and the sequence of that line item also gives you a feel for the amount 
of activity that we booked in Q2 that was relating to contracts that will become earned more than a year from now. 
So take a step back, yes, pull forward activity both in the revenue line and the deferred revenue lines but still very 
pleased with the underlying organic revenue growth rate that we generated across our product set.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company Q
Great. Certainly an impressive quarter and thanks for the color.

James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Okay.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikolay Beliov
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. James, I was wondering if you can comment on the behavior of the data center 
customers in the quarter, [ph] how it is based to your (00:09:00) expectations in light of the – that they had the first 
price increase there. And long-term DR came in probably a little bit higher than we thought and my understanding 
was that you were consciously trying to limit the number of multiyear kind of like grandfathering of deals. So we're 
just wondering what you saw there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, sure. Certainly, our data center business had a strong quarter. We recorded an impressive volume of new 
unit sales but you're right, yes. This was the first price increase that we had rolled out for our data center products 
a few months back and so we did see pull forward activity related to our data center customers.
These customers tend to be larger than the average for us and I think the degree of second quarter activity in 
terms of our pull forward is somewhat related to the fact that those types of companies, larger scale companies, 
take a little longer to get through their decision-making and approvals process.
I think it's also important to note that our partners had an important role to play in the pull forward activity 
generally and we've seen this in prior years. I think we've talked in the past about we have a significant proportion

of our total partner base located in Europe and Asia and so we saw quite a significant pull forward activity there 
being driven by those entities.
Yes, we had reduced the length of a renewal – early renewal from three years, which was the case last year down 
to a two-year maximum this year but the long-term deferred revenue result just really illustrated the depth of 
demand, the interest level in committing to Atlassian's products for the longer term and this was very much 
illustrated in the data center business in particular.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line 
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ittai Kidron
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter, great results. Just again regarding the pull-in effect, I guess I'm trying to 
take a different approach here. I'm sure that every year where you try to figure out what price adjustments are you 
going to make before the calendar year-end you have certain outcomes in mind and clearly, this exceeded your 
expectations quite materially. I guess what can I learn from that on what was your ultimate price adjustment? 
Could it be that – why can't I read this to mean your price increases were quite significant and just forced a signal 
– a greater portion of your customer base to pull-in than otherwise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, we've spoken about before when we rolled out those price increases for FY 2020, we expected the total 
aggregate effect on our revenue growth rates in fiscal 2020 to be about the same as that that we saw in fiscal 
2019 and that breaks down across our deployment options a little differently. So as we've just been mentioning, 
this was the first year for data center price increases.
Server price increases were driving approximately a similar outcome in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019. And on the 
cloud side, we projected a lesser impact on revenue growth rate in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019 and things 
continue to play out along the lines of our original expectations so nothing particularly to observe there.
I think the pull forward volumes that we saw are really just illustrative of the effectiveness of our partners. They're 
clearly expecting the price increases that we rolled out three or four months ago now and they have taken that as 
a specific event that has allowed them to drive an additional level of sales activity in their markets. And again, we 
feel – so that's just illustrative of the underlying demand for our products and the desire to commit to them over 
the longer term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And maybe the only thing to add, Ittai, we've said it before like naturally, in any given year, there's a lots of puts 
and takes. Like some products are going to move up, some are going to stay the same. Some tiers of products 
will move up, some will move down. So, there's sort of lots of different dials that were turning.

Just a reminder that the pricing philosophy for us is bedrock and that doesn't change. We want to remain the high 
value, low price leader; give people ways, the customers easy ways to start and lots of great ways to grow with 
us. There is absolutely no change there.
And I think maybe another question you're not asking or maybe asking or someone will ask later, customer 
response to all of these changes is in line with expectation. I think that's the result of the time that we put into 
planning these changes and they're really customer-centric, customer-friendly approach to how we deploy them.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your 
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
[indiscernible] (00:15:14). Thank you, guys. Very nice quarter and thank you for taking the question.
Had a question about sort of the subscription growth as it relates to maintenance growth and what I mean by that 
is subscription growth has been really dead solid at 50%-plus growth. You guys continue to drive that really well. 
Maintenance growth hasn't diminished at all. I guess it's staying really solid, 20%-plus growth there. I was always 
under the impression that sort of part of this price increases was kind of a carrot and a stick approach of trying to 
push guys from on-premise into the cloud. It doesn't seem like there's any real [ph] demarcation (00:15:48) in that 
maintenance space. Does any of the subscription strength come from maintenance customers switching over or 
will we see that at any time in the future as this become more of like maintenance customers pushing over 
towards more cloud solutions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Keith, thanks for the question. You're right. Certainly, the maintenance line continues to be quite steady. 
Now, there are a few things going on within that line. First of all, we continue to be quite pleased with the progress 
of the rate and pace of customers coming over from our behind the firewall options: server, data center, over to 
the cloud. And so within that maintenance line, that obviously is reflective of server renewals.
We're benefiting now from three or so years of price increases and so that's offsetting the natural gradual decline 
in the unit volume as some of those customers move over to the cloud. Absent that effect, we continue to record 
very high renewal rates for the rest of the customers who continue to utilize our server products at the moment.
The other line I'll just sort of really more draw your focus to is, of course, the license line for the revenue accounts 
and that's where the new server-based activity is recorded, either a brand-new customer or a current customer 
adding additional new licenses. And while we certainly have a good number of those current server customers 
expanding the license count with us, a part of what we were doing with our pricing strategies, particularly this past

year, was to make sure that there was every incentive available for a brand-new customer to Atlassian to choose 
the cloud. And so not surprisingly, you would expect to see that license line gradually decline over time.
Now, in this past quarter, Q2, we recorded a low teens growth in that line and so that was really more of a driver 
from the pull forward activity that we've been talking about quite a bit on the call already combined with, of course, 
the effect of recent years' price increases.

line is open.

Hannah Rudoff
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hi, guys. This is Hannah on for Rishi. Thank you for taking my question today. Just following up on the previous 
question, I was wondering if you could talk about what kind of conversion rate and success rate you've been 
seeing with the free cloud trials for existing on-prem customers and do you have any quantitative color you can 
give on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Rishi (sic) [Hannah]. It's Jay here. No specific quantitative color other than qualitatively, we're really happy 
with how it's performing and how it's opening the aperture on more and more customers beginning to try the free 
editions of products that we've introduced. And over the long-term, that's a good thing. It just means we're getting 
more people to try the product that we can grow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And while it's early, we would continue to look to the guide that we laid out when we started the fiscal year as to 
the impact of free on the revenue economics of the company this year.

Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. If we just look at the subscription growth of 50% in the quarter, obviously 
spent a lot of time here talking about the pull forward effect but maybe dive into expanded seats, new product 
expansion, different types of larger customers, anything else that we can kind of look at beyond just the price 
increase and what may have happened this quarter.

Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I would say all of the things that you mentioned were at play in the quarter as they should be. I think for the type of 
quarter that we turned into in addition to the pull forward effect that James mentioned, just the underlying 
performance of the businesses was where we wanted it to be. So, no specific rabbit hole to chase on any of those 
things. They were all working in the way that we wanted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. And just on the pull forward, there would be a modest element of that $10 million revenue total that I 
mentioned earlier from the pull forward that would accrue to the subscription line because recall that the data 
center business is accounted for there. And so that's what drives a little bit of pull forward effect there but the 
larger single beneficiary of the pull forward revenue effect was, of course, the license line.
And then I think as we've talked about in the past, the other revenue line, that's where we record our portion of 
our app vendor partners' sales and oftentimes, we see customers when they're recommitting to our products, 
extending the term of our products, they tend to do the same thing with their different app vendor partners as well. 
And so that can drop some additional revenue into that other line.

Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. James, maybe this one's probably for you but I think you had 
mentioned a 1% headwind from some of the cloud initiatives that you were rolling out this year during the Q4 call 
last year. If I look at the growth rate in the first half of the year, it's obviously held up very well, definitely I imagine
to some of the demand trends that you've been talking about. But is there any reason that we should think that 
that 1% headwind from the cloud initiatives plays out in the back half of the year or should we think of that as 
being embedded in the first half numbers that you've put up already?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, thanks for the question. Just a reminder as to the three elements at that 1 point of revenue growth headwind 
that we talked about when we did our initial fiscal year guide, so the first point was that we saw something of a 
change in our mix as we saw – as we expected more cloud growth relative to our other deployment options. So 
that has something of a rev rec effect, particularly when you think about on to my earlier points in that more than 
three quarters of our cloud customers take a monthly subscription. So that was the first thought.
Second, that we were rolling out free editions of both Jira Software and Confluence, and then also that we were 
offering free trials of our cloud products to customers who currently utilize our server products and so forth.

So those were the three drivers and I think it's fair to say that the three elements of those, so two of the three 
drivers would be more relevant to the back half of the year because the free additions have been gradually rolled 
out in recent times and we would look to continue to build up that gradual rollout as the year proceeds. The mix 
effect, that's really much more of a gradual effect felt throughout the year.

Heather Bellini
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you and, Jay, congrats and best wishes on your future endeavors.
I just a question I wanted to start with Mike. I was wondering if you could give us your view of how you see the 
market for collaboration software evolving and there's a lot of companies going after the market from different 
parts or different angles. And I guess I'm wondering how do you see these converging at some point down the 
road? Do you see that happening and if so, how do you see it playing out?
And also, how are you feeling about the pace of adoption that you've seen as you start to add some of these 
adjacent offerings such as Trello and Opsgenie? How have they been doing kind of versus what you would have 
expected? And then I've got a follow-up for James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Look, Heather, it's great to get a question, [ph] your tangible break (00:25:04). Look, I mean on a market side of 
things for collaboration, I still think we're in very early innings, right? If you think about knowledge workers how 
much work is still done in spreadsheets and email and other documentations as both knowledge workers digitize, 
business processes digitize in all departments in companies around the world, there's a reason that we talk about 
targeting the Fortune 500,000 and the 800,000 million to 1 billion knowledge workers on the planet today, let 
alone that number itself growing. We obviously feel very good about where we're positioned and how that market 
is evolving in lots of different spaces from Trello all the way up through Jira Software across Confluence and JSD 
horizontally, et cetera. So I think we're incredibly bullish on the overall space and opportunity.
If I have to thread between that and your question on Opsgenie and Trello and other things in terms of adoption 
across our base, I would go back to our long-term philosophy, right? As per James' answer on free on the 
previous question, we're rolling that out pragmatically across the base and across the products over Q2 and then 
through Q3 and Q4 as we learn, right? We're big on test measure, learn; taking slow, steady steps and learning 
and moving forward. It's no different when it comes to integration of acquisitions. It's no different when it comes to 
new products.

Part of the durability and strength of our business has been creating a very efficient business over a long-term 
that's patient and thinks about the future. It's no different when it comes to integrating Trello, integrating 
Opsgenie, et cetera. Obviously, we've got some great Trello numbers and Opsgenie numbers in the letter. We're 
very excited about where both are and both are great product additions to our family for the long-term but at the

Okay, great. Thank you and then, James, I had a follow-up for you. You gave some very helpful color so thank 
you in regards to the pull forward on revenue and on the deferred revenue line as well, so that was helpful. I just 
want to make sure just kind of thinking through expectations here and based on some of your comments about 
how the pull forward is going to impact the second half of this fiscal year and then next year, is it reasonable for 
us to be assuming that the sequential growth in short-term DR in the March quarter is going to be less than what 
you experienced in Q3 last year? And I bring it up just because that was a period where similarly, you obviously 
had a great December and I know you guys measure yourself on a revenue basis, but then there was a lot of 
confusion in March. So, I'm just trying to think through kind of where would you kind of be helping us think through 
expectations just given how enormous this quarter was.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Heather, as you say, we don't guide to that line but directionally, the deferred revenue sequentially in Q2 
was obviously very strong and so of the order of about $25 million more than was the case in Q2 of last year. And 
recall that Q2 of last year was the quarter in which we saw effectively the totality of the pull forward effect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Heather Bellini
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And so we'll see how demand plays out in Q3. As I've said, we've been quite pleased with the underlying strength 
generally, absent this pull forward effect so – but clearly, we do believe that there was material volume, that $50 
million type figure that I referred to a little earlier that is sort of outside the normal sequential deferred trend line.
And one of the other things that I think is relevant to how you're asking the question is that whereas in some years 
past, this pull forward effect has been really very largely a renewals effect. This year, we saw more of a balance, I 
would say, between renewals accounting for about two-thirds of the total and about a third of the pull forward 
effect, really in our judgment coming from new activity. It's easier for us obviously to tag the renewals. We know 
exactly when a customer is due to renew and so we can contrast that with when they actually do renew. But we 
also look in great detail at the trends around our new business and so hence, my comment about two-thirds 
renewal, one-thirds new activity. But that latter element is harder to predict so we'll see how much – particularly 
our partners who've really driven this pull forward activity pretty consistently over the last three years. It's really 
not driven by our direct to the website type business. We'll see how that activity plays out in the fullness of time.

Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Congrats on the quarter and congrats to Jay. It's been great to speak with 
you over the years.
I had two quick questions, one was on the M&A strategy. This quarter has been a solid quarter in terms of cash 
flow generation so could you maybe talk about how you are thinking about deploying that cash over the next few 
years and whether the philosophy is still doing tuck-ins or whether you're sort of thinking about doing something 
really transformational on that side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Right. Thanks for the question. It's Scott here. I'll just remind like we have a – we're really crowded at Atlassian. 
We have built out the capability to build products internally, which we've shown over a long period of time. We 
have an ecosystem in Marketplace that allows us to augment our products with things created outside Atlassian 
with $1 billion lifetime sales and one of my proudest moments doing this job is when you meet people outside the 
business who have built their entire careers building around Atlassian.
And then, of course, we have the ability and track record of bringing in acquisitions and successfully introducing 
them to our existing customer base and integrating with our products to create a solution and an experience that 
is harder to do outside, having the products under our stable. So, we've got a pretty good track record with M&A 
and we've done dozens of acquisitions over time. We have a great team here and I'm always reminded that the 
statistics are against companies having accretive shareholder value to M&A and so we're always very careful 
about how we think about it.
Culture fit is the most important thing that we think about and first and foremost. Then we look at do they share 
our mission. Our mission is always the potential of your team and so can we accelerate their mission by bringing 
us together. And then we look at do they have a similar business model to us and afterwards, we then look at 
geographic footprint and technology and so forth. So, that's the course that we take and I think we've done a 
really good job.
As to looking forward, as you would know, we wouldn't be talking about any potential candidates on a call like this, 
but just know that over time, we'll continue to do M&A in a similar fashion to what we've done historically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Luv Sodha
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Great. Thank you and just one quick follow-up. I know margins were really strong and obviously some of that was 
because of the head count that you guys are pushing that into the back half of the year but over the longer term, 
should we expect to see sort of more leverage on – especially on the R&D side in terms of on the margin 
expansion?

No. I would just reiterate really what we've been saying now for some time and that over time, we would expect 
the opportunity to expand our free cash flow and operating margins. But we are very focused on this very large
market that is in front of us. We're exceptionally well-positioned to go after it and we want to make sure that we 
are making the right moves that will allow us to do so to the best of our ability and that will be a very good 
outcome for our shareholders in our view. So, no change in our perspective around margins.

Michael Turits
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Hey, guys. Good evening. Of course, Jay, congrats and good luck in all things.
Two questions, first one for Mike and Scott, a lot of the development and acquisition has been, let's call it on the 
ops side and yet you do have lesser products in the more technical dev side, what you call code, build and ship: 
Bitbucket, Sourcetree, Bamboo. And there's been a lot of visibility of companies in that space building 
consolidated platforms. Can you talk for a minute about your strategy in that more developer-centric side of the 
business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks for the question. It's Scott here. Yes, that's called DevOps, the trend and the name that people are giving 
to that. And just a reminder for people who aren't maybe familiar with exactly what that is, you've seen a trend in 
companies over the last – over 10 to 20 years where due to the changing pace of business, you see more and 
more departments working hand in hand with each other on. And we saw that 20 years ago with Agile, which was 
software developers working closely with business analysts and then the business side in order to make things 
happen faster and more effectively. And what we're finding now is that as customers move to the cloud, as they 
start building more and more software becomes part of their business that you're seeing the development teams 
and the operations teams, those people supporting the software that's running, they're coming closer together in 
order to make faster cycle times.
And as a sort of any relatively nascent market, there's a lot of noise around it. There's a lot of different people 
doing very small point things and the part that we play really well in which is what we've always played well in is 
having a broad portfolio of products. And the advantage of that is that those portfolio products touch people 
across the entire lifecycle. And so when we get DevOps, we don't just look at it how do dev and ops get together, 
it's okay, well, how do the entire business understand what is happening and bringing all that together.
And if you look at our product portfolio, it runs all the way from business people using Confluence to write 
requirements and discuss what the customers need all the way through to Opsgenie, which is waking people up

in the middle of the night if something goes wrong. And because we cover that broad base, that's why customers 
turn to us because customers aren't looking for just very small point solutions.
Now, whether there's the new things in the market because it's changing, we have an ecosystem integrations and 
a partner network that allow us to work and collaborate with those point solutions that don't make sense for us to 
build out or they're nascent. And customers look to get Atlassian to sort of be the backbone to how work moves 
across their organization even if they're maybe slightly different work that get used in niche products.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Turits
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Okay. Thank you. And then very, very quickly for James, I think you made a similar commentary on this last year 
but you did say pull forward out of fiscal 2021 as well. So how should we think about that at this point, which is 
obviously early?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. So obviously, the long-term deferred revenue kind of gives you a sense for what will play out in the second 
half of fiscal 2021 in terms of that roll-off activity. And then in the short-term deferred revenue line, again, I think of 
Q3 as being the primary donor quarter of revenue into Q2 and then other effects – lesser effects in Q4 of FY 2020 
and the first half of fiscal 2021.

Q
Hi. It's [indiscernible] (00:39:02) filling in for Jack this afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You guys made 
some previous comments that you don't expect material revenue in FY 2020 for Cloud Premium for Jira Software. 
Can you provide an update, the impact on the quarter of Cloud Premium and separately for those that do choose 
to upgrade with a typical uplift?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
So I'll take the first part. No change to our view that Cloud Premium products: Jira Software, Confluence, JSD. 
We're very pleased with our launch of those products but I wouldn't expect those to have a material impact on our 
fiscal 2020 revenue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah and then the uplift is 2x so basically the entry point and then it diminishes there as you have more volume, 
when you get into the higher tiers and have more volumes of users.

Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Thanks very much. Congrats, everyone, on the quarter and, Jay, you've been a tremendous asset to Atlassian. 
Best of luck in whatever you do next.
So for Mike or Scott, given that we're beginning a new calendar year, customer budgets being reset, strategic 
priorities being mapped out, et cetera. I'm curious to hear your expectations as it relates to adoption of DevOps as 
well as broader collaboration across IT. Are you expecting a continued steady progress or are there any changes 
in trajectory that you think we could see in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Good day, mate. It's Mike. Look, I think continued steady progress is what we expect to see. Obviously, 
development as a whole, the creation of software, technology-driven businesses extending into DevOps and how 
that flows through the rest of the business is a growth area of investment for companies large and small all 
around the world so that's a great space to be in. And our products have been – work off that as we work to more 
and more teams is a very strong space, but I don't expect to see any major changes in that at a broad scale.
From our perspective, obviously we continue to see, advocate for and feel pull from the customers over the move 
from server and on-premises products to the cloud and that's something that we continue to talk about, continue 
to see and continue to work with customers to manage that sort of decade-long transition that's happening there.
I think we're doing a really good job at the moment but there's always work to be done and you can see that in our 
continued enterprise releases on the cloud side, continued releases of migration tooling for our customers and our 
partners to help those companies to move to the cloud and get access to all those features and the benefits of 
running their software in the cloud. And you've seen us over the years continue to really support Premium as we 
just talked about; Access, which is a great product for Atlassian and for the customers in terms of protecting their 
users and content across a large number of cloud services and then things like pushing the scale limits and other 
things in the cloud as well as our channel and other things moving in that direction. So that's probably the biggest 
move we're going through and expect to see continuing momentum on this year.

Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
That's great. Thank you and then just maybe a quick one for James. It's hard frankly to find much to pick at this 
quarter but your net new logos of 5,000 were a little lower, I believe, than the year ago period. Just wondering if 
there's anything that you would attribute that to.

I might take that, Gregg. I mean as we said before, customer count can fluctuate quarter to quarter, but this 
quarter's in the range with where we're really pleased, and it's healthy growth year-over-year at 17%.
Some of the fluctuations in any given quarter up or down can be influenced by pricing and packaging changes. 
We've talked about things like new monetization levers in Trello, naturally free plans in cloud and we talked about 
the headwind effect on revenue and so those things can be puts or takes in customer count.
We're pleased with the early signals from some of those long-term moves like free plans as we mentioned earlier 
and that's ultimately going to add to the long-term growth opportunity that we focus on at Atlassian.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of 
Montreal. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States) Q
Hi. Thank you very much. James, I wanted to target this question to you, if I could and it really relates to the 
March quarter revenue guidance. And the question is what's different from last year? And what I mean by that in 
the context of if I think about the December 2018 quarter, the timing of the price increases was roughly the same, 
the impact of the price increases was roughly the same, probably a little bit higher in the December 2018 quarter 
and yet if I look at the – and if I look at the revenue the sequential growth in December 2018, it was about 12%. 
You guys did a little bit better than that in this quarter and yet you're guiding revenues to decline sequentially in 
the March quarter – this March 2020 quarter. Last year, you actually grew sequentially off the same sets of 
attributes I just described, over 3%. So, I'm trying to understand why you think revenues will be down 3% when in 
similar circumstances, last year revenues actually grew sequentially 3%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Keith, I'd really bring us back to this discussion of the pull forward activity that we've been talking of. Yes, 
we have that 1 point of revenue growth headwind that I referred to and broke out on one of the earlier questions, 
but the pull forward activity is significantly more material to answering your question.
And so really that's what I would point to. Recall that this was the first year where we had raised prices on our 
data center business and that, as indicated a little earlier, was really quite strong. Our partners around the world 
but particularly those in EMEA or in APJ really took that onboard. In fact, we have given them additional 
incentives to drive data center business as we think about the margin structure that we share with our partners.
So really that's what I'd point to as to the Q3 guide. Again, we're very pleased to – from a full year guide 
perspective, have been able to add to our previous guide the full beat that we were able to record in Q2 plus 
additional monies beyond that as well. So...

Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
...quite pleased with the overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States) Q
...yeah, just to interject, if I could. It appears again last December quarter, you had pretty material pull-throughs in 
addition to it. The numbers just would seem to suggest that the guidance, even with those pull forwards since the 
situation was similar last year, does seem a tad conservative. It may be what you said in terms of there was more 
new customer activity this year than perhaps renewals but otherwise, it just seems extraordinarily conservative for 
the March quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Well, as you say, the new activity was a larger proportion of the pull forward total than we had seen in the 
past and so that's our judgment and we'll see how much of that new activity in essence in Q2 was a replacement 
for what would otherwise have played out in Q3. But also, consider that the deferred revenue increment that we 
recorded in Q2 sequentially was really quite substantially different to that that we saw in the prior year as well. So 
those are the things that have helped us arrive at our expectation and therefore guide for Q3.

more about our work just people, partners using Atlassian as kind of a more generic, low-code app development

We were really pleased, I think, with the results in the quarter and the continued demand that we see and as 
we've said before, we feel like we're in a really good position to own large-scale Agile transformation initiatives 
that are bubbling up at some of the world's largest companies. And this is the segment that we target with Jira 
Align. It's already a segment that is ripe with massive adoption of Jira at the team and tribe level. And so I think 
connecting all of that collaborative work that exists in Jira up to the strategic level of these big organizations is a 
huge and really important opportunity for us.
And maybe one anecdote, just a couple of weeks ago, we hosted four companies that were all Fortune 100 
companies that took a day out of their busy schedules to just spend time with our field operations teams and talk 
about the work that we're doing with Atlassian broadly but also with Jira Align and the role that I just described. So 
short answer is, it's going great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Scott here. I'll just continue on the question about low-code and Forge. We've been in business for a while now 
and one of the powers, particularly Jira but of most of our products is the flexibility that they offer. And we were 
chatting with a large Australian bank just last week and their workflows across the bank are mission critical, all 
implemented inside Jira and that's HR work for us, [indiscernible] (00:50:05) work for us. It basically manages 
their entire business and, of course, that also helps in terms of the Jira Align like the more work that's in those 
products, the more you want to get a kind of top-down view on and how and where work is happening.
And if you think of the ways we are investing there, [indiscernible] (00:50:26) that's a huge opportunity for us to 
take more of these business workflows. We've invested in a simpler Jira interface. We call that next generation 
Jira and delightful to use for everyone. Business users can create drag and drop workflows, fields, and get going 
really quickly. But the extensibility of Jira is where technical teams turn to because they can use it as a no-code 
environment, drag and drop. They can then augment that with low-code as in by writing functions or integrations 
to other systems and the improvements we've made, as I said with the UI ones and the interface.
We've also – as you've seen, we've acquired a product in automation and that's with increasingly as customers 
put more and more work into their products, they want to make sure how do they reduce the amount of time they 
spend on that work. And so automation makes that a much more appealing thing for our customers.
I've gone on for a very long time but that is an area that we focus on and, of course, when you graduate into 
actually coding, we have all the products that are available with all our Jira and all our DevOps products for all the 
people that need to write coding and integrated development in that environment.

where you are with the demand. You're talking about you're bullish in terms of the market. You feel good in terms 
of where you're positioned. You're confident in terms of the strong demand and is it fair to say then that you 
haven't seen much competitive thrust or changes from some of your peers, including a very big one out in 
Redmond?
And then also, especially since you're also talking about you're still seeing a lot of spreadsheets, a lot of users, so 
much spreadsheets. Is it also fair to say that you still see a lot of greenfield opportunities?
And lastly, another thing which is probably a challenge with other software companies, especially software 
companies going cloud is technicals – gaining technical staff. You're looking to ramp up and you yourself say in 
your shareholder letter it's ambitious, your R&D staffing to the second half. You're not going to make any changes 
in terms of where your R&D center is and your R&D is hiring. Are plans are going to be for the second half? Is 
that also fair to say? Thanks.

Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Jonathan, mate, it's Mike here. That was a – there's a lot in that question. If I start from the back forwards, 
absolutely. Look, if there are a few things that have defined Atlassian, it's a combination of our long-term focus, 
patience, openness with shareholders, staff and everybody else in our ambition to unleash potential of every 
team. This was a good example as we wrote in the shareholder letter, we missed on execution this quarter when 
it came to hiring and some of the things inside the business, and that's not a good thing. It's something we've got 
to improve and we're committing to continuing to do that and we're open about doing that. 
The R&D hiring environment, I think any company will tell you, is not simple. It's not an easy thing to do and we're 
trying to scale the company patiently but urgently at the same time and we're just being open about sometimes 
we don't hit that. We didn't this quarter. We've got to redouble our efforts to do it next quarter and the quarter 
ahead. It doesn't any easier from here. But sometimes, that's going to happen and we're pretty honest about 
that. 
From a competitive standpoint, look, Seattle has lovely coffee, that's important. We continue to treat competitors 
the same way we always have and we're very aware of what they're doing. At the same time, we focus on the 
customers and the value we deliver to them and we've long believed if we continue to deliver great value 
products and we're patient to show value to customers, it will come back to us in value for shareholders and for 
employees over time. We've demonstrated that over almost two decades now. We don't intend to change that 
stance. It's baked into our business model, it's baked into the ethos and thinking of the founders, and then 
hence, it's being baked into the company and our DNA at a very deep level. 
Competitive environments will always shift. Software development is a very competitive area. The collaboration 
space is a very competitive area. We're very positive on where we stand and we're going to attack that by 
focusing on our customers and making sure we're delivering value for them and their needs. Whether those 
competitors are large companies, small companies, startups, open source projects, we'll continue to be aware of 
what they're doing and focus on delivering customer value. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We reported record net product sales of $303 million in the first quarter, representing 3% sequential quarterly 
growth and 52% growth over the first quarter of 2020. These results reflect rapid adoption of both PADCEV and 
TUKYSA on top of strong sales of ADCETRIS. Our financial strength is driven by product sales, as well as 
royalties and multiple strategic collaborations. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and investments, 
which positions us to expand our programs, advance our research and development, and invest in our business.
As we look ahead, we're focused on three strategic priorities to drive continued innovation and growth. Focusing 
on these key pillars will ensure our organization is aligned and empowered to deliver substantial benefit to 
shareholders, our employees, oncology healthcare providers and especially, cancer patients.
Our first strategic priority is to maximize the global potential of our three approved medicines through robust 
clinical development programs and exceptional commercial execution. I'll begin with ADCETRIS, a remarkable 
product that is the foundation of care in multiple CD30-expressing lymphomas. With six indications in the US, 
ADCETRIS serves as the basis of our core business. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 76 countries. 
Importantly, our partner, Takeda continues to pursue additional approvals for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and 
peripheral T-cell lymphoma in its territories. We are committed to maximizing ADCETRIS' patient reach and are 
advancing a clinical development program in Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple other malignancies. Our global 
success with ADCETRIS is enabling us to continue investing in our pipeline and newer medications.
Our next key product is PADCEV, a first-in-class ADC that has quickly become standard of care in previously 
treated metastatic urothelial cancer. Locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer is an aggressive disease 
with poor survival, high associated healthcare costs, and limited treatment options. PADCEV is the first drug to 
improve survival after patients have received a platinum chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. Since the 
beginning of 2021, we've made substantial progress with health authorities toward expanding the US label and 
securing global approvals across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Roger will share details about these activities 
during his remarks.
We're also advancing two trials designed to redefine frontline treatment for metastatic urothelial cancer patients 
globally with a focus on the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA. And we continue to make significant 
headway in exploring earlier stages of bladder cancer. In collaboration with Astellas and Merck, PADCEV is being 
tested in two randomized Phase 3 trials in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients and intend to initiate an 
exploratory study of PADCEV in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Our third key product is TUKYSA, a best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor for HER2-positive metastatic 
breast cancer patients with and without brain metastasis. TUKYSA is now approved in 36 countries. In February, 
the European Commission approved TUKYSA in the EU and the regulators in the UK granted its marketing 
authorization in Great Britain. This is a significant milestone for patients in Europe, who will for the first time have 
an approved medicine that has demonstrated a survival benefit for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after 
disease progression, following two anti-HER2 treatment regimens.
In anticipation of these approvals, over the past year, we've established affiliates in key European countries and 
built teams with deep industry experience. We recently launched TUKYSA in Germany, France and Austria. We're 
pleased by the early uptake physician feedback and that TUKYSA has already been included in some key 
treatment guidelines given the strength of clinical evidence. Through our expanded European footprint, we are 
poised to execute upon another upcoming TUKYSA launches and collaborate with individual countries to 
maximize its ability, availability and patient access.

In addition to this commercial progress, we are conducting a broad clinical development program designed to 
maximize TUKYSA's potential, including trials evaluating it in HER2-positive breast, colorectal and gastric 
cancers, and in HER2 mutant tumors.
Our second strategic priority is to advance our late-stage programs toward securing approvals for new products. 
One such asset is tisotumab vedotin or TV. Earlier this month, FDA accepted for priority review, or BLA, seeking 
accelerated approval for TV with an action date of October 10. The submission comprise data from innovaTV 204 
pivotal Phase 2 trial, which was presented at ESMO and was recently published in The Lancet Oncology. This is 
an important development in the treatment of cervical cancer, which remains one of the leading causes of cancer 
death in women globally. TV is positioned to be our fourth commercial product as we look to expand our portfolio 
further. And together, with our partner, Genmab, we are preparing for its launch.
Our third strategic priority is to advance our innovative early-stage pipeline through continued leadership and 
innovation in antibody drug conjugates, internal R&D investments, and corporate development opportunities. Our 
earlier stage pipeline includes seven programs in clinical trials and multiple preclinical assets advancing toward 
INDs. I'm proud of the remarkable progress we've made in growing and evolving our business and assets to 
better meet the needs of cancer patients.
Next, I'll turn the call over to Chip, who will discuss our commercial business. Then, Todd will provide an overview 
of our quarterly financial results. After that, Roger will detail our clinical development and pipeline progress. Chip?

Charles Romp
Executive Vice President, Commercial US, Seagen Inc.
Thanks, Clay. Our three approved products are important first-in-class or best-in-class medicines that have been 
embraced by oncologists and patients. We believe that each of the brands have blockbuster potential, and we 
continue to invest in our commercial capabilities to ensure we can maximize the opportunity to gain future 
approvals and label expansions. We are engaging with our customers through multiple channels and are pleased 
that most of our sales representatives have been able to safely return to making face-to-face calls.
ADCETRIS sales were $163 million, a 1% decline versus Q1 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact 
Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, but we are seeing early signs of recovery. And despite this headwind, we've 
maintained share in our frontline indications. We are monitoring these trends and it is our expectation that 
diagnosis rates will return to historic norms. We continue to message the landmark five-year ECHELON-1 
progression-free survival data in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. We are encouraged by the favorable reaction to the 
data we received during recent market research with physicians.
Moving on to PADCEV, first quarter sales were $70 million, double the first quarter of 2020. We are pleased with 
our quarterly growth after a strong launch. Our efforts continue to focus on promoting the full breadth of the 
PADCEV label. The locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer marketplace is rapidly changing and we are 
confident that PADCEV is well positioned to this year for continued growth as the market evolves. Our sales 
representatives have been proactive in educating healthcare providers on our label update and customer 
sentiment remains positive on PADCEV's risk benefit profile.
Transitioning to TUKYSA, first quarter sales were $70 million, an increase of 14% over last quarter. These results 
are in line with our expectations given the challenging Q1 patient copay dynamics of oral oncolytics. We continue 
to gain market share in both patients with and without brain metastases. TUKYSA provides an overall survival 
benefit for patients with and without brain mets, and we are confident that we can continue to drive share gains for

all patients. TUKYSA is now the most utilized product in second and later lines for HER2-positive breast cancer 
patients with brain mets.
And finally, we are very pleased to receive a priority review for TV. A brand team is in place and we are working 
closely with our co-promotion partner, Genmab. We will be ready for launch ahead of the October 10 PDUFA 
date. If approved, this would be an important new drug for women with metastatic cervical cancer. And we look 
forward to adding it to the proven Seagen commercial model.
Now, I'll hand over to Todd.

Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc.
Great. Thanks, Chip, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Our financial results for the 
first quarter reflect significant progress across the business. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the 
quarter, which are in line with our expectations for the full year.
Total revenues were $332 million in the first quarter of 2021. This included net product sales of $303 million from 
ADCETRIS, PADCEV, and TUKYSA, representing growth of 52% over the first quarter of 2020. Growth in product 
sales is driven by the continued strong uptake of PADCEV and TUKYSA since their launches in the US.
Royalty revenues in the first quarter of 2021 increased to $27 million compared to $20 million in the first quarter of 
2020. This growth reflects royalties earned on increasing sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda, as well as royalties on 
sales of POLIVY by Roche and BLENREP by GSK. Collaboration revenues were $2 million in the first quarter of 
2021 compared to $16 million in the first quarter of last year. As discussed when we gave our 2021 financial 
guidance, collaboration revenues are primarily driven by progress-dependent milestone payments from our 
collaborators which causes quarterly variations in revenue. In the future, we expect collaboration revenues to 
reflect the profit share from Astellas from sales of PADCEV in its territories.
Cost of sales in the first quarter of 2021 increased to $64 million. This included product cost of sales and royalties 
for each of our three brands, the PADCEV profit share of $33 million to Astellas, as well as non-cash amortization 
of acquired technology cost for TUKYSA.
R&D expenses increased to $230 million in the first quarter of 2021. This reflects continued investment across our 
pipeline to drive progress of our late- and early-stage pipeline. SG&A expenses increased to $160 million in the 
first quarter of 2021. This reflects commercialization efforts related to the launch of the PADCEV and TUKYSA in 
the US, as well as investments to support the launch of TUKYSA in Europe. We ended the first quarter with $2.5 
billion in cash and investments and we have no debt. This positions us strongly to advance our plans in 2021 and 
beyond. And lastly, our financial guidance for 2021 is unchanged.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Roger.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to share today key R&D activities for our approved 
medicines as well as our pipeline programs. I'll start today with PADCEV. As a reminder, PADCEV has 
accelerated approval in the United States for metastatic urothelial cancer patients who have previously received 
both platinum-based chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. The randomized Phase 3 EV-301 trial which

compare PADCEV to chemotherapy in this setting, demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients who received PADCEV. These data were presented 
at ASCO-GU and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The EV-301 data were also submitted to FDA in a supplemental BLA under the Real-Time Oncology Review and 
Orbis programs. And this month, the application was accepted for Priority Review with a PDUFA date of August 
17. This application seeks to convert PADCEV's accelerated approval to regular approval and integrate into the 
label the important overall survival data that PADCEV has demonstrated.
To address the potential for PADCEV in metastatic patients who've received checkpoint inhibitor and are cisplatin 
ineligible, we conducted cohort 2 of the EV-201 pivotal trial. Positive data from this cohort were presented at the 
ASCO-GU meeting in February. Earlier this month, FDA accepted our supplemental BLA to potential expand the 
US label to include this population. The application is also being reviewed under RTO and has been given Priority 
Review with the same PDUFA date of August 17. And abstract including additional follow-up data from cohort 2 
will be reported at ASCO in June.
Our strong PADCEV data have enabled substantial regulatory progress outside of the United States. In the past 
two months, we and Astellas have engaged with eight regulatory authorities around the world and marketing 
applications are currently under review including in Australia and Canada, with Health Canada assigning Priority 
Review; in the EU, where the application has been assigned accelerated assessment. Importantly, this could 
shorten the time to approval, and lastly, in Japan, Brazil, Switzerland, and Singapore. We need to advance a 
substantial PADCEV clinical development program, which includes two trials that could support approval in firstline metastatic urothelial cancer. We expect to complete enrollment of cohort K of the EV-103 trial in cisplatinineligible patients receiving PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA by the end of this year. And if data are supportive, we plan 
to submit a supplemental BLA after appropriate follow-up for duration of response.
In addition, we continue to enroll patients into the Phase 3 EV-302 global trial, which includes both cisplatineligible and ineligible patients evaluating PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA compared to a platinum-containing 
chemotherapy regimen. These trials are supported by initial data from the EV-103 trial which resulted in 
Breakthrough Therapy designation. Updated durability results and long-term outcomes from these initial data will 
be presented at ASCO.
As we move PADCEV into earlier stages of bladder cancer, two Phase 3 trials are enrolling patients with muscleinvasive disease. Both trials utilize PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA. The KEYNOTE-B15 trial also 
called EV-304 is enrolling cisplatin-eligible patients and KEYNOTE-905 also called EV-303 is enrolling cisplatinineligible patients. Additionally, we continue to work to bring PADCEV into a clinical trial for non-muscle invasive 
bladder cancer patients and have completed our initial regulatory discussions with the FDA. In summary, we are 
making great progress with PADCEV.
Turning now to TUKYSA. The development team is advancing a similarly broad clinical program to support label 
expansions in breast cancer and investigate TUKYSA in other HER2-positive cancers. In breast cancer, we are 
evaluating TUKYSA plus Kadcyla in first- and second-line metastatic patients in the HER2CLIMB-02 trial. 
Additionally, we are pleased to report that the first patient was recently enrolled in the randomized COMPASS 
HER2 RD trial being run by the Alliance [ph] Cooperative Group (00:19:47) evaluating TUKYSA plus Kadcyla in 
high-risk adjuvant breast cancer patients.
In GI cancers, we are on track to complete enrollment in the MOUNTAINEER trial by the end of 2021. This trial is 
intended to support accelerated approval in the United States for patients with advanced HER2-positive CRC.

Also, we are advancing TUKYSA in several exploratory studies including in combination with an oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapy regimen in first-line GI cancers; in a basket trial for solid tumors with HER2 alterations that include 
mutations and in combination within HER2 for HER2-positive breast cancer.
Moving on now to ADCETRIS. We are excited that the ECHELON-1 five-year manuscript has now been accepted 
and we anticipate publication in the coming weeks. Results demonstrated robust and durable remissions in 
patients with newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin lymphoma who received ADCETRIS in combination with AVD. 
Five years free of disease progression is a clinically meaningful and important milestone in a cancer patient's 
journey.
Going forward we continue to invest in the development of ADCETRIS with several ongoing clinical trials. Notably, 
we have a randomized Phase 3 trial in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, exploratory evaluations of ADCETRIS plus 
nivolumab plus AD in front-line advanced and early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, and we are exploring ADCETRIS 
in combination with KEYTRUDA as an immunomodulatory agent in solid tumors.
Now, I would like to turn to our late-stage program, tisotumab vedotin, which we are developing in collaboration 
with Genmab. Earlier this month, we announced that FDA accepted our BLA seeking approval of TV for treatment 
of women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. The FDA has assigned a priority review and the PDUFA 
action date is October 10. We believe TV could make a meaningful difference to these patients where there is 
such a high unmet need.
We also recently initiated the innovaTV EV-301 global Phase 3 trial in a similar population of recurrent or 
metastatic cervical cancer patients that is intended to support global regulatory applications and serve as the 
confirmatory trial in the United States.
Turning now to ladiratuzumab vedotin. We continue to work with our partner, Merck, to co-develop LV as 
monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in LIV-1 expressing solid tumors. Our clinical development 
program is focused on optimizing dose and schedule as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in 
breast cancer. A basket trial is also currently enrolling patients with lung, head and neck, prostate, esophageal, 
gastric cancer and melanoma.
Across the rest of our pipeline, I'd like to summarize a few recent highlights. At the AACR meeting in early April, 
we presented several compelling pre-clinical data sets with our Phase 1 clinical programs. This included SEATGT where we showed the enhanced anti-tumor activity when combining SEA-TGT with a checkpoint inhibitor or 
a vedotin-based ADC. In addition, we described encouraging preclinical data with SGN-B6A and SGN-STNV, 
both of which are novel vedotin-based ADCs that have recently entered the clinic. We also entered into a clinical 
trial collaboration with Pfizer under which we'll evaluate SEA-TGT in combination with sasanlimab, the 
subcutaneous PD-1 inhibitor. The combination will be evaluated as a part of our ongoing Phase 1 SEA-TGT trial 
in advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.
And lastly, we completed enrollment in our clinical trial evaluating SEA-CD40 as a part of a combination regimen 
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We expect to report clinical data from the trial sometime later this year, 
which will inform next steps with this novel effector function enhanced nonfucosylated antibody that bind CD40.
In closing, we have achieved many important milestones and have made significant progress across our pipeline 
in the first quarter of 2021. We look forward to providing you with further updates as the year progresses.
And now, I will turn the call over to Clay.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Roger. The past year has been pivotal for Seagen, and the company is well positioned for the future. 
Today, we have a deep and diverse pipeline, a multiproduct commercial portfolio and additional potential 
approvals on the horizon. Additionally, we have powerful partnerships, a broad geographic footprint and 
substantial financial strength to maximize our assets from our early-stage pipeline to our expanding portfolio of 
approved medicines. The solid foundation we have built sets the stage for Seagen's next phase of innovation and 
execution. I am confident in our ability to continue delivering cutting edge innovation in medicines that make a 
meaningful difference to the lives of cancer patients.
I would like to thank everyone listening to this call for your continued interest in Seagen. Operator, please open 
the line for Q&A.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes 
from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Harrison
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hey, guys. This is Greg Harrison on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question. The question is, what sort of 
physician reception have you seen with respect to PADCEV after the cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome that 
came out? On our end, we've heard KOLs saying it won't affect prescribing much and they can screen out the 
high-risk patients, but just wanted to see what you guys are hearing on your end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So Greg, thank you for the question. PADCEV has really delivered a very strong launch with rapid penetration into 
our labeled indications, following its approval right at the end of 2019. So, really, full year of 2020. The –
concerning the label, safety is always a top priority for us, and label updates inform physicians on what to do and 
how to work with patients to prevent anything from happening. Our sales reps have been educated, healthcare 
professionals have been updated and educated, and physician sentiment remains very positive on the risk-benefit 
profile, a very positive risk-benefit profile with PADCEV. It has not been an impediment to adoption. It is a very 
rare occurrence and it has not changed practice on use of PADCEV. Roger, do you want to add anything to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Thanks, Clay. So, the label- skin reactions have been part of the PADCEV safety profile for some time. And so, 
this was an important sort of post-marketing observation that was just extended into the label. So, from the 
beginning, we message very carefully around safety, it's important. Most of the side effects are transient and 
reversible. And we think it's valuable for physicians to understand this. So, again, from a medical perspective, this 
does not change the risk benefit for PADCEV and we believe it will continue to be used and we certainly haven't 
changed any of our clinical trial plans.

Operator: Next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connor Meehan
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Hi, Clay and team. This is Connor on for Matthew. So, on tiso, could you comment on the outlook for the 
KEYTRUDA combination and I guess how quickly you could move that into a registrational program? And then, 
quickly, are you seeing any competition from TRODELVY and what are your expectations for the impact on that 
drug to PADCEV? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Okay. Thank you. So, two completely different questions, one is on TV plus KEYTRUDA. So, let's start with that. 
So, we're very pleased with how TV is moving along. As we said, we took tisotumab vedotin, or TV, and we have 
submitted it and we now have a PDUFA date, we have with the accelerated approval timelines. So, we're pleased 
with that.
And the current therapies for metastatic cervical cancer are really poor. They're generally with response rates of 
less than 15%, median OSS between six and nine-and-a-half months. So, it is a significant unmet need, certainly 
in the US and around the world, incredibly significant. And so, our program includes a big part of it, which is 
combining with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy. So, we have multiple arms there, and that's in earlier lines of 
cervical cancer. And so, we're very pleased with the success there of getting patients to the trials and putting 
together a real opportunity there, where we have not presented any data yet. But the trials have been going very 
well and we will be, at an appropriate time, presenting the data and information on these and making decisions to 
– whether or not to go to a pivotal trial.
It's my hope that we see great data and we go into a pivotal trial to try to get the kind of data that you could submit 
for earlier-stage cervical cancer, which could be really beneficial to patients and also a substantial market.
Roger, do you want to add anything to what we're doing with TV and KEYTRUDA?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Right. So, Clay, exactly as you say, we have a monotherapy path for approval which is currently under review and 
that same monotherapy in late-line cervical cancer with a global trial that's running. But of course, our interest is in 
combinations as well in order to move into earlier lines of therapy. And I think we're well positioned with regard to 
the way we're evaluating combinations of chemotherapy and KEYTRUDA, such that if we do get positive 
readouts, we can take those combinations forward into further clinical development.

So, your second question is about competitive impact of TRODELVY. First of all, I want to say that we are very 
pleased that there are more options for patients. We're a very patient-friendly company and think about how best 
providers and doctors can treat patients with life-threatening diseases, so is more, the better for patients.
So, second of all, PADCEV has become the standard of care in its approved indications, and it's really firmly 
entrenched in the metastatic urothelial setting post-platinum, post PD-1. And PADCEV has shown OS benefit and 
it is – we're very pleased with where PADCEV is in the lineup. Now, Roger, you may be able to discuss any 
updates or thoughts connected with that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, as Clay indicated, the more treatments that are available for patients, the better. However, the PADCEV 
program, which is substantial, has already created the use of PADCEV in a specific line of therapy and it is, as 
you say, essentially a standard of care, which is difficult to displace. So, we're glad that TRODELVY is there. 
However, we do see PADCEV having a very strong – very strong value proposition.

Thank you. Maybe just a question on TUKYSA here. You noted that it's the most utilized product in second-line 
HER2-positive patients with brain mets. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in the same setting in 
patients without brain mets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, thanks for the question on TUKYSA. As you know, TUKYSA is approved for patients with visceral 
disease as well as patients with brain mets. And we are certainly using it in both patients and getting a lot of 
uptake there. Chip, could you comment a little bit on the dynamics in the market of using TUKYSA in brain mets 
and in patients with visceral disease?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Romp
Executive Vice President, Commercial US, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks, Clay, very much. So, we're pleased with the progress that TUKYSA is making. We're seeing both 
increased utilization in patients with and without brain metastasis. And as I mentioned earlier in the reading, we're 
now the most used product in second-line and beyond for people with brain mets. So again, uptake has been 
robust on visceral mets as well, and it continues to grow.

Q
Hey. Good afternoon. This is [ph] Turner (00:34:02) for Cory. Thanks for taking my question. So, just one on the 
Phase 1 SEA-CD40 study. As you mentioned in the prepared remarks, enrollment completed with around 159 
patients across a bunch of different tumor types. Can you just give us a sense of how many tumor types moved 
into expansion cohorts, or was it just pancreatic cancer? And also, just assuming you see signals with indications 
like pancreatic later this year, what do you see as potential next steps? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, I have, in previous calls, talked about my interest in working on pancreatic cancer. It's just such a huge 
unmet medical need and how – that's something that I felt as a cancer biologist, as someone making cancer drug, 
and I was really hopeful that we could make an impact on pancreatic cancer patients. So certainly that's been an 
important part of this study.
Roger, can you talk a little bit about where we are with SEA-CD40 in our plan. And later on this year, we are 
planning to have data. I think we committed to presenting data for SEA-CD40 sometime this year. Now, that does 
not mean that we're going to wait to making programmatic decisions till our data is presented. We can make 
programmatic decisions at any time and meet with regulators at any time and try to go forward on this really 
emerging exciting program. But, Roger, can you talk a little bit about what we're looking at in our arms before 
making any decisions on pivotal trials?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, the CD40 program began as essentially a monotherapy program. We have an active agent. We have 
responses based on monotherapy. We then pivoted the program from monotherapy into a combination approach 
and that initial focus is in pancreatic cancer. So, as Clay alluded to, we are interested in testing CD40 plus 
chemotherapy plus a PD-1 inhibitor in front-line pancreatic cancer. And that's the data that we will be focusing on. 
However, from a biologic and sort of scientific perspective, we are interested in the construct of combining a 
CD40 agonist together with some form of cell killing through chemotherapy, together with a PD-1 inhibitor. So we 
are working on plans potentially to look at other possibilities for further CD40 development, but the initial focus in 
the combinations space is pancreatic cancer.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had another one on the early-stage pipeline, specifically on the TIGIT 
antibody. It looks like other TIGIT antibodies have had rather similar single agent activity in Phase 1 studies, with 
a few anecdotal responses seen there. I guess to what degree would you expect an antibody like yours with 
enhanced effector function could potentially improve upon these competitive molecules?

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, thank you for the question on our SEA TIGIT. So, we're just studying it now. So, we've not reported any data 
at this point. But pre-clinically, we saw that we had a very high effector function, because it uses our SEA 
technology, which we've talked about before how that augments effector function while decreasing the inhibitory 
effector function. So, I'm not going to go through all that again since I've talked about it a lot.
But we are very excited to take our drug into clinical trials. The hope with any drug is to see single agent activity 
and then the hope with any drug is that not only does it work in single-agent activity, but it works in combination. 
And so, we have a lot of plans on what to do in combination with PD-1 inhibitor and with a single agent. And so, 
we're working on advanced solid tumors and lymphomas and we are – we're cranking forward. So, I look forward 
to a time where we're presenting data.

Yeah, yeah. So, Andy, thanks for the question. It's actually cohort A. So, it's the original data set, some 45 
subjects that we saw that initial remarkable signal. And the data we've presented has been mature. It's even more 
mature now and we're excited to bring that forward, so you can see what the long-term outcomes will look like 
with this combination of PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA in cisplatin-ineligible patients with frontline metastatic

Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. An elaboration on a prior question and then a separate question. Roger and 
Clay, you mentioned completing that SEA-CD40 study in pancreatic cancer data later this year. And, Clay, it 
seems like you're excited about this one. But just hoping you can contextualize a little bit more. What is a win 
here? Is seeing stable disease enough to get excited in pancreatic cancer given the huge, huge, huge unmet 
medical need that was mentioned, or do you really need to see responses to really have conviction there?
And then, just on PADCEV, wondering if you could help us with the breakdown of the bladder cancer market and 
the incremental size of that metastatic and locally advanced bladder cancer market that was previously treated 
with the PD-1 and PD-L1, but is ineligible for cisplatin. And just trying to think about the incremental add from that 
sBLA that we're expecting to come online later this year. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Why don't we start with the bladder market, and Chip, can you talk a little bit about the question Kennen 
asked about what we can expect with the potential additional market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Romp
Executive Vice President, Commercial US, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah, absolutely, Clay. So, this is a smaller segment of the population, but nevertheless, I think a meaningful 
number of patients. There is an important unmet need given these are typically older patients. They suffer from 
multiple comorbidities like poor kidney function. We are already seeing some unpermitted utilization, but we think 
there's a remaining opportunity once we get labeled to promote to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, going to your question on pancreatic cancer, Kennen, there are a lot of things you can look at. Now, the study 
we have enrolled and we'll be presenting data on will provide us a lot of information on ORR, objective response 
rate. And just for reference, the gem-abraxane ORR is about 23% in their Phase 3. And so, if we come in 24%, it's 
not going to be meaningful. So, it has to be substantively above the 23%.
Second of all, we want to look at the duration of response. We do that with every drug we do, whatever disease it 
is, we look at duration of response. And you don't want a duration that's super short, because that doesn't really 
help patients. It's not that meaningful. And the regulators also want to see duration. So, we want to see it for 
ourselves in this lead-in trial. And then, the other thing is we want to try to take an initial look at saying what is –
can we learn anything about OS, it's not a randomized study. It's not – that would be the next study we did.
But there's a very well-catalogued information on pancreatic cancer and what OS is. So, we think we – we'll get a 
handle on that and be able to say, okay, we have ORR, we have duration and we have some trends in OS, 
because it's not going to be statistically meaningful to arm data. That would happen next. But we have trends 
there. And we saw these kinds of things in other drugs we developed, and it's important to look at them and say 
how are you doing in all these really critical data sets. And that's what we've been doing. And I have gone on 
record saying, I am really interested in this and excited about what we're seeing initially.
To that extent, we publicly said we're going to expand what we're doing. We – pancreatic cancer, a lot of people 
in history have seen data on a little bit, a few patients and have been – and once you go to a lot of patients, it 
hasn't really panned out. So, we're trying to be appropriately studying this to know in an expanded population 
from our initial evaluation, will the data hold will be exciting and should we go into a pivotal trial with it. And this is

something – is the way we develop many drugs. And so, this is not unique to S40. This is something we've done 
with other drugs and expanded what we've done and get a really good handle on. I think that by doing these 
expansion studies of single arm studies, your hit rate of Phase 3s, in randomized studies is much higher. And I 
think that our hit rate historically has been high once we get some additional conviction based on a little bit bigger 
study and not just a tiny study.
So, that's what we did with this. We had a very small amount of data. We were – I was speaking for myself, I was 
excited with it. But I – and the clinical team here wanted to really be sure of what we're seeing. So, that's what the 
data that will come out as. Roger, do you want to have any comments on this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
I think – so, these are single arm experiments. And obviously, the key points are, exactly as you say, what's the 
rate of response, what's the durability of those responders, what is progression-free survival look like and what is 
overall survival look like. And there is a very clear record of what to expect with standard chemotherapy. So 
hopefully, if we see positive data, we'll be able to make some decisions about what a potential next step could be.

Q
Hi. This is [indiscernible] (00:45:07) on for Gena. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just one quick question 
about TUKYSA launch in Europe. We're glad to hear that you have launched in Germany, France and Austria. So, 
what do you see as the potential ramp-up there over the course of next year? How many additional markets 
would you expect to enter? And also, kind of related question on PADCEV Europe – potential European launch, 
so do you expect the launch pace to be roughly the same?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, first of all, thank you about the TUKYSA question about Europe. We are very pleased with our progress. 
TUKYSA is now approved in 36 countries worldwide and that includes the EU and the UK. We have general 
managers in the major countries. They're building teams. They have deep industry experience. We have done 
commercial launches now, as we've said, in Germany and France within one month of the EMA approval. So, 
that's brand new.
We are working to make TUKYSA available as quickly as possible and feasible in all the European countries. But 
we have to navigate the local HTA processes. So, that takes time. They don't all come on at once. I mean, this is 
a little bit of a different process than in the US, where you could say that once the US approves, all states are 
approved. But in Europe, you have to go one at a time at a time. And we don't just do them sequentially. We're 
working on at the same time. But it still is not all.

And then, with regard to the UK, we are actively engaging with the organization called NICE with a decision 
expected in the fourth quarter of this year. So, very, very big efforts to get it into all these countries, with just a few 
of the countries recently having commercial launches.
And so, right now, we expect the majority of TUKYSA revenues to come from the US, and that's what we are for 
now. But in the future, we expect more and more to come from Europe.

Ellen Sands
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Hi. This is Ellen on for Steve. So, I understand tucatinib is being evaluated in combination in HER2, in 
HER2CLIMB-04. So, I'm just curious what the bar for success is there and maybe how you're thinking about the 
safety profile of this combination.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Absolutely. We think that TUKYSA is a great drug to combine with and use in a lot of different regiments. 
Roger, can you talk a little bit about what you're thinking with TUKYSA and HER2?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. So, both drugs are highly active. And obviously combining active drugs in oncology is a potentially fruitful 
path in terms of trying to find effective combinations. And just bear in mind, because in HER2 with trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy, it's essentially the same sort of conceptual construct as was in HER2CLIMB where we 
combined tucatinib with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, which is capecitabine.
So, it's following the path frankly that we are taking with tucatinib. In multiple other places, we are using tucatinib 
in combination with Kadcyla. I don't think we've set any bars, we need to explore. And we'll see. Once we have 
some data at the hand, we can determine what potential value that regimen may have as a combination.
From a safety perspective, again, I don't think we have any expectations one way or the other. I don't think we're 
expecting amplification of safety from either side. But we need to generate the data and then we can evaluate.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, I appreciate very much the question. We definitely have second-generation molecules that we're working for 
ADCETRIS. There's actually a few of them that we're working on. And one of them, we call C as you referred to. 
But there are some different molecules. Quite frankly, they're all exciting. It would not be impossible for us to take 
more than one Phase 1 study and compare them there and then decide which one to go with. So, I don't want to 
rule that out either.
There are some technologies that I'm not at liberty right now to explain exactly, but I think are exciting. I have a 
unique perspective and having been one of the pioneers in this field and building it up and the field has now really 
taken on a life of its own and it's a lot of companies now work on ADCs. So, I look in the past and some of the 
ADCs and how they were made were with bad linkers and natural product drugs. And I call that 1.0. And then, 
there was better drugs, synthetic drugs and much better linkers that are in drugs like ADCETRIS and PADCEV 
and POLIVY from Roche and others. And so, I call that ADCs 2.0, if you will.
And then, how will we get as a field to ADCs 3.0 and what can we do and what are the technologies that are 
needed to continue improving the efficacy in patients and decreasing any of the side effects that you have. That's 
always the goal or what the doc say, getting a better risk benefit ratio, and how can we do that and what can we 
do. So, we have spent many years pioneering some new technologies that we have.
And I am really jazzed up about these new technologies based on all of their preclinical data in efficacy and in 
safety, including non-human primates. So, I think what you'll see from us is another generation of new ADCs that 
may have different payloads, different linkers, different ways of thinking about how to do these different toxicities 
or lack thereof, and those are coming. So, we are working hard on ADC 3.0. So, stay tuned. We'll be talking about 
it as soon as it's appropriate to.

Reni J. Benjamin
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Q
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess mine is regarding the non-muscle invasive 
opportunity. Can you maybe provide some color regarding the discussions with the regulatory agency? And the 
trial is planned for BCG-unresponsive patients, but do you have any thoughts on moving that either in 
combination or potentially supplanting BCG?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Reni, for the question. Roger, do you want to address what we can talk about now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is a large unmet need. As you point out, BCG-unresponsive is the 
place to begin. But depending upon what the product profile looks like in terms of its efficacy and safety, it –
there's always a possibility to consider combinations and a lot of folks are going with combinations of BCG or 
potentially looking for a new gold standard. What's attractive about PADCEV in terms of its possibility and it is 
just, at this point, a possibility is that in the preclinical experiments that we've done, we have almost no systemic 
exposure. And that's an important part of the equation for patients who are not going to die necessarily of their 
bladder cancer, but needed to be managed and try potentially to avoid things like surgery. That's the one point.
The other is that the target that PADCEV is going after, which is [indiscernible] (00:56:02) is highly expressed not 
only in the advanced and metastatic populations and in muscle invasive, but in non-muscle invasive as well. So, 
we have an opportunity to instill PADCEV test giving intravascular PADCEV to see if we can gain control first of 
BCG unresponsive. And then, if we have a strong positive benefit risk that we would like to take forward, yes, we 
would clearly want to develop it further.

Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a quick one on your CD40 antibody. Maybe can you talk about the 
biology on that target that why you think your sugar-engineered, SE anybody can work better than other 
antibodies? I think it seems like the side effects could be the issue, I guess. Why do you SEA has – could maybe 
avoid that problem? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, I'm not exactly positive how to address this. But, what we're looking at is trying to enhance the activity that 
you get through effector function and also decrease the inhibition that you get. When you look at PD-1, they 
released a break on T cells. So it's a very fine balance between getting more activity, but releasing inhibition. And 
we think that our SEA technology does – has some properties that no one else has. And we've observed them in 
pre-clinical models and we've talked about them a lot.
So, we're really excited about it. Now, the proof is in the footing. We have to go and we have to test this in 
humans that have cancer and see what we obtained both on safety, because we're very, very cautious about 
making sure we're saving patients and really transparent about that, but also in efficacy and seeing what 
happens.
In addition to working with this as a single agent, there's a lot of efforts going on to bring it in combination, and 
that's something with the PD-1 inhibitor and that's something that's important as a part of the trial. So, we're 
bullish on the molecule, we're bullish on our technology and we're hopeful, but we're not ready to discuss or 
present the data.

Bradley Canino
Analyst, Credit Suisse Q
Thank you. I wanted to ask, is some of the moderation in the PADCEV sales growth over the past three quarters 
due to patients being too sick to continue to a third-line therapy and not getting the opportunity to try PADCEV? 
And then, more broadly, Clay, how do you think about the low systemic treatment penetration in metastatic 
bladder cancer overall and then maybe how PADCEV can change that when it gets approved in earlier lines?

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Okay. So, these are questions that I certainly want Chip to comment on. Chip, would you – do you want to see 
what...

... how you can answer this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Romp
Executive Vice President, Commercial US, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. Absolutely. So, it's not uncommon at this stage of the launch to see product growth begin to decelerate. 
PADCEV is a standard of care. We are very optimistic about the changing market dynamics in this marketplace. 
PD-1s and PD-L1s have moved up utilization into the front line. We think that's going to continue in 2021, which 
will provide PADCEV an opportunity to do increase its treatable patient population.

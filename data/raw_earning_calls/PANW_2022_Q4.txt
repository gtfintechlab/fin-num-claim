Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Clay. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. As you can see from the 
video, we were excited to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our IPO in early July. Our employees are engaged 
and excited as we continue confidently in our mission to be the cybersecurity partner of choice.
Moving to Q4, I am pleased to report that we again saw very strong results, starting with top line results that were 
well ahead of the guidance we initially outlined for the fiscal year 2022. We delivered this growth while balancing 
our profitability commitments. We also made significant investments to continue to transform our company and 
take advantage of the large and rapidly growing market opportunity we see in cybersecurity.

On the top line, billings growth of 44% was the highest we've reported in four years. We also grew RPO ahead of 
our revenue growth rate. The key focus of our team has been rapidly positioning us as a constant cybersecurity 
innovator. And one way we measure our progress is how our NGS ARR develops.
We're delighted to report this metric grew 60% reaching $1.9 billion exiting the year. We are expecting it reach 
$2.6 billion in FY 2023. If this was an independent start-up, it would be amongst the fastest-growing cybersecurity 
businesses to achieve scale.
Within our core network security business, Firewall as a Platform billings grew 26%. When we started reporting 
this metric, the intent was always to show that we continue to take share in the network security market, at the 
same time, transform the business to a software business. Today, close to 50% of that comes from software form 
factors.
Operating income grew 52% in Q4 and our operating margin for the year finished at the high end of the guidance 
range, with adjusted free cash flow margin coming in above the high end of the range we provided. We achieved 
a major internal goal we've had on the profitability front, delivering GAAP profitability this quarter. Looking forward, 
we're guiding to full-year GAAP profitability in fiscal 2023.
We've had many of you ask us about the macro environment and how is it impacting our business and the 
markets we serve. In the last year, we arguably saw the most challenging supply chain conditions the technology 
industry has ever seen. We executed through this well during the year with modest impacts to our gross margins. 
We expect conditions will eventually ease. For our planning, we're assuming a material improvement won't be 
seen prior to the end of fiscal year 2023. However, as the supply challenges fade, we expect this will start to have 
a favorable impact on our product gross margins.
There's a continuing debate on inflation, its nature and duration. We saw some labor and other inflationary 
pressures in the second half of the fiscal year. We do not anticipate these pressures going away in the next fiscal 
year. And we have planned for it to persist through fiscal year 2023, and hence, it is included in our plan and is 
reflected in our guidance.
With respect to the macro impact on demand, we've just come out of Q4 with exceptional 44% billings growth. 
And enterprise sales, as most of you know, that is Q4 magic. We did, however, see some marginal changes in the 
macro environment in Q4. Whilst early, it is important to see how the overall macroeconomic conditions develop 
over the next year.
First, we saw more longer-duration deals as customers increasingly had the confidence to make large, long-term 
commitments with us. This is important as a transformation objective we set out for Palo Alto Networks. It 
confirms and validates our view that customers will consolidate if we give them constant best-of-breed products 
and then show that they are integrated to deliver better security outcomes. Second, we saw some isolated 
instances of customers extending the life of hardware, potentially driven by macro forces. We expect that on the 
margin, this could continue into FY 2023. It is counter-balanced by some customers refreshing their state and our 
continued share gains in the hardware form factor.
Third, in transformational projects, the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here, despite 
the expected short-term macro impacts. Security spending is tied into our customers' desires to move to the 
cloud, drive more direct relationship with their customers, modernize their IT infrastructure, as well as drive 
efficiencies while adapting to a new way of working. Those efforts continue. Coupled with the heightened

awareness and need to do something on cybersecurity, we expect secular tailwinds to persist in cybersecurity, 
and we are best positioned to deliver against our customer needs.
Another trend I would like to highlight is the return to Palo Alto Networks by employees who had left for seemingly 
greener pastures. Over a six-month period, as part of our Welcome Home program, we have engaged with many 
former employees. To-date, dozens of top performers have been rehired with many more in the funnel. Over 70% 
of people reached out to have expressed a desire to come back to us, and a significant number already have, 
50% returning from start-ups, the next largest percentage coming from peer companies. We're happy to welcome 
these employees back to Palo Alto Networks.
As we embark on a new fiscal year, my fifth as Palo Alto Networks' CEO, it is worth reflecting where we came 
from. Our transformation strategy has not been easy, but we are unwavering in our resolve to build the most 
comprehensive and relevant offerings for our customers, taking away their complexity and delivering a better 
security outcome for them. We see a path to being the largest cybersecurity company backed by constant 
innovation and excellent execution, becoming our customers' cybersecurity partner of choice, while delivering 
increasing value to our shareholders. Just four years ago, we were a different company.
We have reinvented the firewall market and captured the market share leadership position. There were glimmers 
of our Next-Generation Security strategy, but it made up just 8% of our billings. Our software story in network and 
security was early, with some traction in our virtual firewalls and a fledgling precursor to SASE called 
GlobalProtect Cloud Services. We made our first acquisition in cloud-native security and had early point products 
that would become part of Cortex. When we stepped back and took stock in the industry, we had a key 
hypothesis, which we then tested, proved to ourselves and have reproduced across the business you see today. 
There has not previously been a cybersecurity company with a leadership position in multiple categories nor do 
the customers believe that a cybersecurity platform could anchor their architecture. We set out on this ambitious 
journey as we stood up Prisma Cloud and Cortex as well as innovated significantly in our network security 
capabilities.
Fast forward to today, our transformation has taken us far. We are a recognized leader in 11 cybersecurity 
categories across our three platforms, Next-Generation Security contributed more than 38% of our billings, 
helping to accelerate our growth. In network security, we now have the most comprehensive solution across three 
form factors that share a common architecture and also offer a suite of market-leading security subscriptions. We 
have built, assembled, and integrated capabilities in nine modules that make up Prisma Cloud, which is now the 
leader in cloud-native security. Lastly, we have three anchor products in Cortex with our new XSIAM product 
showing promise in revolutionized security operations is going to hold us in good stead.
The proof that this transformation is working is in the momentum we are seeing in our customers. The number of 
customers that spend over $1 million annually with us continues to grow, with the millionaire count now in excess 
of 1,200 and the number of Global 2000 customers that have purchased products in all three of our platforms is 
now 50%.
While we've had many large customer wins recently, I want to highlight the theme in three transactions. The first 
is a technology company that purchased products in all three of our platforms and transaction over $75 million in 
value. The second is a financial services company that standardizes network security in our platform including 
adding VMs and deploying Prisma Cloud, spending north of $40 million. And the third is a professional services 
company that spent over $75 million across Strata, Prisma and Cortex.

One of the outcomes from our transformation over the past four years is a steady increase in our subscription and 
support mix, primarily driven by the growth of our Next-Generation Security business. Subscription and support 
now exceed 80% of our billings. This has resulted in greater predictability in our revenues. We are seeing growing 
commitments from our customers represent a greater portion of our next year's revenue. As we enter fiscal year 
2023, that number is 59% at the midpoint of our guidance. Increasing revenue visibility gives us further 
confidence in our ability to invest and drive future growth. This number is over 70% for the revenue we expect in 
Q1.
All of this has occurred while our revenue growth has accelerated from FY 2020 to FY 2022, in part because of 
the accelerated growth in our Next-Generation Security offerings, while we have also taken share in traditional 
network security plans form factors as reported by third parties.
Despite the success so far in our transformation, we still see significant potential ahead of us. We estimate our 
large addressable market to be growing at a rate of 14%. At 29%, our fiscal year 2022 revenue growth more than 
doubled this market growth rate. As we have transformed the business, we have seen our revenue growth 
reaccelerate. Even with this significant growth over the last four years, we still only represent approximately 6% of 
our TAM, we last presented on Analyst Day in September 2021. 6% share of the market is low for the market 
leader as compared to other categories in technology. So we see there is ample room to grow.
There are numerous trends that excite us around our ability to drive this growth and continue our share gains. We 
may soon see a day where there will be $1 trillion in public cloud consumed and our observation thus far in this 
early market is that companies allocate 2% to 5% of their cloud budget to security, creating a significant Prisma 
Cloud opportunity.
There are 3.5 million worldwide cybersecurity jobs that are unfulfilled. Our view is that more training and hiring 
alone will not effectively and efficiently counter the growing use of automation employed and attacks and the 
volume of alerts that is overwhelming the security operation center. We believe a new paradigm in security ops is 
needed that heavily leverages AI and automation. We are targeting this opportunity with our Cortex products and 
XSIAM products specifically.
Lastly, hybrid work is here to stay. There are more than 1 billion knowledge workers globally. We believe we have 
a strong position in SASE with our coverage of users and branch offices today just scratching the surface of the 
large opportunity. We have a clear mission in front of us in each of our security platforms to harness the 
opportunity that we have outlined.
As this is Q4, I figured rather than having me outline all the accomplishments from our product team, I would 
invite Lee Klarich who patiently listens and sits in our calls to give you a more detailed update to help you 
understand how we will continue to build on our success we have in FY 2022.

Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Nikesh. As Nikesh highlighted, across cybersecurity, one of the biggest challenges has always been 
the overwhelming number of point products that customers must deploy, integrate and operationalize to achieve 
the security they need. In most cases, this is never fully achieved, leading to expensive yet suboptimal security 
outcomes. We are bringing a new approach, one that delivers market-leading capabilities tightly integrated in 
three platforms.

FY 2022 has been a significant year for us in network security, where we have furthered our position delivering a 
consistent security architecture across hardware, software, and SASE. We neared completion of our Gen-4 
hardware rollout, which on some models delivers close to 10x performance over Gen-3. As a result, we saw over 
50% of NGFW hardware sales in Q4 on Gen-4. Also in FY 2022, we introduced the Cloud NGFW across three of 
the major clouds, enabling our customers to adopt best-in-class network security in a cloud-native service. In 
Prisma, SASE had three major launches in FY 2022, including the most recent ZTNA 2.0 launch, firmly 
establishing our next-gen approach to Zero Trust.
Across our hardware, software and SASE form factors, we are able to deliver a consistent set of core security 
capabilities as ML-powered cloud services. In FY 2022, we saw the rapid adoption of advanced URL filtering, and 
we now see nearly all URL filtering sales on this advanced ML-based service.
Advanced Threat Prevention, which was introduced in fiscal Q3, is also now off to a strong start. And perhaps 
most importantly, customers can manage all form factors and security subscriptions from a single management 
console, to deliver consistent user experience and tremendous operational leverage. While we believe the full 
platform is where customers will end up, we want to ensure customers can start their adoption with any form 
factor and receive a truly best-in-class solution.
The number of $1 million lifetime value SASE customers that are also customers of our two other network security 
form factors ended FY 2022 at 210. This is up eightfold since FY 2019. We have seven customers that have 
purchased all three of our form factors with $100 million in lifetime value in network security. More broadly, when 
we look at our network security customer base, customers that have bought all three platforms from us spend 10x 
more than those who are customers of only one form factor. This showcases the true value of our network 
security platform.
In Q4, we introduced ZTNA 2.0, which redefines state-of-the-art in Zero Trust Network Access to bring 
uncompromised security and deliver Zero Trust with zero exceptions. We have seen significant momentum at our 
customer traction on SASE in FY 2022 on a number of fronts. Our overall active SASE customer base grew by 
51% in Q4, and our million-dollar SASE deals also accelerated this year, up 83% with over 50 $1 million deals in 
Q4 alone.
While many of these large deals are coming from our installed base as they see the value across our form factors, 
it is equally important that over 30% of our new SASE customers in Q4 were new to Palo Alto Networks. This 
highlights the competitiveness of our SASE solution, and enables us to reach net new customers. Additionally, 
once we land with a new SASE customer, we are seeing customers look to standardize on our hardware and 
software appliances.
In the cloud, we see that most customers are still relatively early in their journey. They are migrating workloads to 
the cloud and building new applications, growing their footprints, consuming more sophisticated services and 
adopting multiple clouds. With this has come an expansion in their cloud security needs. Our approach with 
Prisma Cloud delivers a comprehensive platform with a growing set of capabilities to stay ahead of our customers' 
needs.
Increasingly, cloud security needs to start at the moment developers write their first lines of code through to 
deploying and running this code in public cloud. The acquisition of Bridgecrew brought us infrastructure as code, 
a way of detecting and fixing security issues during development. IaC become our ninth integrated module of 
Prisma Cloud at the end of January. And in the first six months of availability, we already have over 200 
customers, making it our fastest-growing new module.

We designed an incredibly easy way for our customers to activate any of the nine modules and have grown the 
number of customers that use more than three modules to over a third, and those using four modules to nearly 
20%. This frictionless module adoption has helped to fuel our 55% growth in credits consumed on the platform. 
We are also closing in on 2,000 customers for Prisma Cloud.
It's great to see all the third-party recognition like the SC Award as Best Cloud Workload Protection Solution that 
we announced today. But we're not done yet. We see several opportunities for new modules and will continue to 
look at both organic development and external technology to drive continued expansion of the Prisma Cloud 
platform.
We are early in our Cortex platform journey, executing well across our three core product categories of XDR, 
Security Orchestration and Automation, and Attack Surface Management. We saw significant progress in FY 
2022 as we drove sales of our key products and increased traction combining offerings in larger cross-Cortex 
transactions. Our customer count surpassed 4,000, and we also signed 52 transactions greater than $1 million in 
Q4. Combined with this customer success, we also continued the rapid innovation that we believe will be required 
to be a leader in security operations more holistically.
When we envision the future of cybersecurity, I don't see a path to success that is not heavily driven by AI and 
automation. Attackers are too well-funded and determined, while customer networks, clouds, applications, and 
users are too complex to manually defend. The only way to deliver meaningful security outcomes is by collecting 
rich, useful data, normalizing all data sources to a single source of truth, and then applying AI models to detect 
attacks and automate responses in real time. We are now taking this to the next level.
Earlier this year we announced XSIAM, a fully integrated AI-driven SOC platform, and kicked off a program with a 
limited number of design partners to ensure we had strong product market fit. The results of this design partner 
program are incredibly encouraging, proving our assumptions about the value of good quality data powering AIbased attack detection and native automation simplifying and speeding response. And I'm happy to say our first 
paid customer was a seven-figure purchase, and most of the other design partners are likely to purchase in the 
coming months. We are on track to launch the product into a broader set of our customers in the first half of fiscal 
2023.
We could not have accomplished all we have in the last several years in advancing our lead in network security, 
standing up our cloud-native security platform and progressing toward the autonomous SOC without our 
investments in innovation. Over the last several years, our R&D spending has grown in order to enable our 
ambition to lead with the three platforms. You see this in major product releases which reached nearly 50 in FY 
2022. As we move into FY 2023, we are more committed than ever to leading in cybersecurity innovation. My 
team went through a rigorous process of prioritizing our most important investment areas across our three 
platforms. With the continued investment in R&D, I'm confident we're set up to deliver a great set of innovations in 
the coming year with focus on the most important areas for our success.
With that, I'll pass it back to Nikesh.

underway. We continue to have confidence in our team's execution and the traction we're seeing across our 
platforms. We expect to continue to deliver strong results, in line with the profile we have talked about for the last 
year since our Analyst Day.
For fiscal year 2023, this includes billings growth of 20% to 21% and revenue growth with increasing predictability 
that is in the mid-20s. After achieving operating margin at the high end of our guidance in fiscal year 2022, we 
intend to deliver operating margin expansion of 50 basis points at the high end of our guidance with adjusted free 
cash flow margins of over 100 basis points at the high end of our guidance, while absorbing increased supply 
chain costs and inflationary impacts. We achieved GAAP profitability in Q4 fiscal year 2022, and we project this 
will continue for fiscal year 2023.
Lastly, today we also announced a three-for-one stock split. This was done to help ensure our shares are 
accessible to all employees and investors. The stock split also demonstrates our belief in the future of the 
company and the momentum and confidence we have in our strategy.
With that, I will pass on to Dipak to discuss our Q4 results in more detail as well as our Q1 and our fiscal year 
2023 guidance.

Dipak Golechha
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon everyone. Today we again reported another strong quarter which 
culminates in the strong fiscal year for Palo Alto Networks. For Q4, revenue of $1.55 billion grew 27% and was at 
the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 20% and total services grew by 30%. By geography, we saw 
strong growth across all theaters, with EMEA up 33%, the Americas growing 26%, and JAPAC growing 24%. 
Next-Generation Security ARR grew 60% to $1.89 billion with strength across the portfolio.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered total billings of $2.69 billion, up 44%, which was above the high end of 
our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q4 was $6.99 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance 
obligation or RPO was $8.2 billion, increasing 40% with current RPO representing about half of our RPO, similar 
to recent quarters.
With nearly all of our hardware products now refreshed, as Lee had mentioned, over 50% of our Q4 product 
orders were booked with Generation 4. Customer reception has been positive with the majority of customers still 
in the early phases of their upgrade. Our Firewall as a Platform billings grew 26%. We also continued to see an 
increasing software mix within our FWaaP billings up two points to 48% in Q4.
Moving beyond the top line metrics I've already highlighted, non-GAAP gross margin of 73.2% was down 210 
basis points year-over-year, as we continued to incur additional expense for components and shipping. We 
expect this headwind to persist for much of fiscal year 2023.
Last Q4 we guided for a fiscal 2022 operating margin of 18.5% to 19%. We're pleased to have achieved the high 
end of our goal by delivering 19% operating margin for fiscal year 2022, while absorbing higher-than-expected 
supply chain costs. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter grew 57% to $254 million or $2.39 per diluted 
share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. GAAP net income was $3 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted 
share.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we finished Q4 with cash equivalents and investments 
of $4.69 billion. Days sales outstanding was 98 days, several days above of where it would have landed without

the impact of late quarter shipments. Our discounts continue to be in line with what we have seen over the last 
year. Q4 cash flow from operations was $524 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $485 million. We 
achieved 33.3% adjusted free cash flow margins for the year, above the high end of our 32% to 33% guide for 
fiscal year 2022.
During Q4 we repurchased approximately 755,000 shares on the open market at an average price of 
approximately $483 per share for a total consideration of $365 million. Additionally, our Board of Directors 
authorized an additional $915 million for share repurchase, refreshing our authorization for future share 
repurchases back to $1 billion expiring December 31, 2023.
On the M&A front, we closed one very small acquisition in Q4. We reduced our stock-based compensation as a 
percent of revenue by approximately 3% year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. SBC will remain a focus area in 
fiscal 2023 as we balance the use of SBCs to attract and retain top cybersecurity talent with scale and leverage in 
this area.
Lastly, moving to guidance and modeling points. It is worth noting that in fiscal 2022 we had flexibility built into our 
plans that allowed us to execute through some real-time developments during the year such as supply chain and 
labor inflation. We've used the same approach in building our fiscal year 2023 plans, incorporating a degree of 
flexibility of outcomes. It's also worth noting that we saw very strong Q4 business activity. In some cases, this was 
from customers taking advantage of ordering hardware and especially subscriptions ahead of a price increase 
that took effect on August 1. We also saw some customers make large commitments in the fourth quarter that 
might have otherwise happened in fiscal year 2023.
As you think about next year, note that in the second half of fiscal 2022 we have very strong billings with some 
benefit from an increase in invoicing of multiyear contracts for a few large customers. In Q4, without this impact, 
our billings would have been in the mid- to high-30s.
Turning to our guidance for the fiscal quarter of 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.70 
billion, an increase of 22% to 23%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.555 billion, an 
increase of 23% to 25%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.06. For the fiscal year 2023, 
we expect billings to be in the range of $8.95 billion to $9.05 billion, an increase of 20% to 21%. We expect NGS 
ARR to be in the range of $2.60 billion to $2.65 billion, an increase of 37% to 40%. We expect revenue to be in 
the range of $6.85 billion to $6.9 billion, an increase of 25%. We expect product revenue to be in the mid- to highsingle digit percent range year over year. We expect fiscal 2023 operating margins to be in the range of 19% to 
19.5%, which is 50 basis points ahead of the range we provided for fiscal 2022, and consistent with the growth 
targets we presented during our fiscal year 2021 Analyst Day. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 
$9.40 to $9.50. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 33.5% to 34.5%. And we expect to be GAAP 
profitable for fiscal year 2023.
Regarding our fiscal year 2024 financial targets which we outlined at our September 2021 Analyst Day, we have 
strong confidence in achieving those objectives, and we hope you take away from our call today some of the 
reasons behind this confidence.
Additionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect approximately 42% of our operating 
income to come in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 58% in the second half. We expect our nonGAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q1 fiscal year 2023, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q1 
2023, we expect net interest and other income of $6 million to $8 million. We expect Q1 2023 diluted shares 
outstanding of 108 million to 110 million shares. We expect fiscal year 2023 diluted shares outstanding of 111

million to 113 million shares. We expect our Q1 capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million. And we expect 
fiscal year 2023 capital expenditures of $190 million to $200 million.
And finally, as Nikesh noted, we announced today a three-for-one split of Palo Alto Networks' common stock. The 
decision was driven by a desire to make our stock more accessible to our employees and the broader group of 
investors. It is also supported by our underlying confidence in our continued business momentum.
Shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6, 2022, will receive two additional shares after the 
close of business on September 13, 2022, for every outstanding share held on September 6. Our stock will be 
trading on a split adjusted basis on September 14, 2022.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.

Hamza Fodderwala
Analyst, Morgan Stanley Q
Hi. Thanks, guys. And thank you for taking my question, and a really nice set of results. Dipak, just a clarification 
question for you real quick, did you say that the billings growth in Q4 would have been mid- to high-30s excluding 
the estimated pull-forward? And then also for Nikesh, you mentioned some early macro commentary about 
longer-duration deals. Are you also seeing any changes in the sales cycle as you guys do more [ph] seven, eightfigure, nine (31:05) deals? And then is that reflected in the guidance at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, just to keep the efficiency of time, yes, Dipak did say that it's some of the – it's important to understand, not 
just pull-forwards, we had some large long-duration deals. And if you normalize for them, we just want to make 
sure we set expectations for next year that 44% was exceptional, and some of that was because of some large 
longer-duration deals. And we normalize for that, and you'd end up in the mid- to high-30s. So, this is more 
precautionary on our part as opposed to telling you that we're not doing well.
On the front of – look, deal lifecycles have been elongating at the top end of the market for us as the deal size 
have grown. This is not net new to us. This has been happening over the last two or three years. When I came, 
the largest deal we did was $28 million. Now we've done deals closer to $100 million. So, obviously, it takes a 
longer time to get $100 million deal in place and requires a lot more validation from our customer's POCs in 
getting engaged.
So, that trend is consistent. We have not seen any change in that driven by economic factors, if that is your 
question. As I said, [indiscernible] (32:12) shared a little bit of sweating of hardware assets to push them out a

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rob D. Owens
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Would love to drill down into the success you guys are seeing in Prisma 
Cloud. And what are the biggest factors and/or technical differentiation that's driving your success right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Let me give you sort of an overarching picture, and Lee has been kind enough to at least elicit it in our product 
capabilities. But, like, very quickly we're noticing that if you go out and look, there's just hundreds of billions 
dollars of cloud being sold by our cloud service providers, the top five around the world. And what is becoming 
clear is most of the top-end or large customers are in multiple clouds, they're not just in one. We ourselves are in 
GCP and have AWS instances and a little bit of Azure. So we're seeing ourselves in multi-cloud scenarios. So, 
one, that multi-cloud development is causing customers to look for a multi-cloud solution, and that's normally not 
driven by one cloud service provider. It's typically somebody like us. That's one part of it.
The other part is if the customer is looking for point solution, it's harder for us. But most customers are migrating 
away from point solutions, looking for a more platform approach. As Lee highlighted, Bridgecrew, which we 
acquired, operates on the left side of the development lifecycle. It's the build's lifecycle. Prisma Cloud used to 
traditionally operate in the run cycle where you put things into production. By connecting build and run, we've 
created the sort of even the extension to the development lifecycle. So we are seeing people who are taking a 
serious view towards cybersecurity in the cloud come to Palo Alto Networks and not chase some point solutions. 
If you look at the industry, there are no platform solutions available. Most industry groups have already validated 
that as the SC Awards we heard about this morning. So, Lee, do you want to add something? Technical defense 
issues?

I'll add one piece, and actually Nikesh said in his prepared remarks, not only do we have a platform approach, but 
everything that we deliver from the platform is best-in-class. And that combination is critically important for our 
customers to have the trust and confidence in using Prisma Cloud.

Philip Winslow
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Q
Hey, congratulations on a great end to the fiscal year. Now, when we speak to your partners, a growing message 
back has been that an increasing amount of the demand for Prisma Access, which obviously had a great quarter, 
is coming from enterprises that have been customers of other competing on-premise firewall vendors. However, 
they do not offer as robust a set of cloud services Palo Alto Networks does. And, Lee, to your point, during your 
slides, the number that jumped out to us today was that more than 30% of new SASE logos in Q4 were new to 
Palo Alto Networks. So, Nikesh, then maybe Lee, if you could comment, too, if you think forward here, what is the 
opportunity to not only monetize SASE and Prisma Access, but also to potentially transition that largely onpremise install base of those competing firewall vendors to Palo Alto Networks platform, what are you hearing 
from customers and why?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Well, Phil, I think in the last year I would say our ability to deliver, deploy, and sell SASE has grown. And as you 
picked up in the number, 30% of these customers are net new to Palo Alto. And the way it works is we go to 
them, they appreciate our firewalls, but the problem is they now have bought firewalls from somebody two years 
ago, three years ago, five years ago, and there's still lot of end of life in them. So they like us, they like our 
solutions, but they're not able to execute because somebody before them bought them or they bought them at a 
moment they were diluted. So, now comes a point where are able to convince them that our SASE solution is 
right. Our excitement for these 30% customers is that over time, they will then migrate their on-prem hardware to 
Palo Alto as well. Early days, but we're noticing some of these customers who bought our SASE solution, 
because they understand our security fabric, then have deployed it and it's a simple attach of putting hardware 
because security solutions have already been put into place.
So, we have taken share in the firewall market by most third-party estimates somewhere between 300 to 400 
basis points, and we think part of the driver is us being able to deliver a more comprehensive Zero Trust Network 
Security capability. As Lee highlighted, we have customers who have spent north of $100 million of lifetime value 
on network security with us, which is hard to do.

Adam Tindle
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Okay. Thank you very much. Nikesh, on the NGS portfolio, congrats on the success, you're just under $2 billion at 
this point. And I thought I'd maybe touch on the growth versus profitability algorithm for that piece of the business 
now that it's at this level of scale. If I look at the fiscal 2023 guidance, it implies that new NGS ARR is going to be 
just over $700 million, which is a big number, but it's about the same dollar amount as you added in fiscal 2022. 
Could you just maybe speak to kind of the crossroads of opportunity to invest more for NGS ARR, and maybe a 
new step function level of new ARR growth versus is it a better opportunity now to harvest and improve 
profitability, and certainly any metrics you can provide on where you are and where you can go on NGS 
profitability would be great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So, I'm sorry, I'm confused. Are you saying 50%, 60% growth is time to harvest or time to grow faster? 
Sometimes I can never make you guys happy. It's like three years ago we said $1 billion. You guys were, like, 
holy shit, that's a big number. You won't get there. We get you to $1.9 billion in four years, and [indiscernible] 
(37:53) just like start making more money. Like, as Lee highlighted, we are trying to balance our R&D spend with 
our growth aspirations. I personally believe there is so much room in the cybersecurity market, as we've 
demonstrated. Since I came, revenue growth is up 50% in terms of percentage growth. So we used to grow in the 
19%, 20% range. We bring it to 28%, 29%. And I think that's a good place. It's such large numbers, we're growing 
at a good number. We're going to keep balancing our investment, yet showing you fiscal prudence.
Could I go spend more money and let the operating margin languish lower? Yes. But I don't want to. We promised 
that we'd keep extracting operating margin to make sure we're fiscally prudent, and we're going to do that. But at 
the same time, we use the opportunity of every dollar to make it more efficient and keep spending for growth. We 
think our growth profile, obviously, as you would expect, has improved for most of our products that we were 
taking bets on about three or four years ago. I think it's also important to understand ARR is a leading indicator of 
revenue. So, revenue comes in after ARR. And then your costs come in day one.
So, yes, our operating margins for these new areas are getting better, in some cases getting to positive from 
negative, but I think we're still further away. Until you see the impact of the $700 million, $800 million we added 
this year, as that flows into revenue, the next $700 million flows into revenue, we hopefully will keep expanding 
our operating margins, which is fueling our ability to give you that 50 basis point expansion over the years. But 
we're going to keep striking the balance.

Brian Essex
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. And thank you for taking the question. And I'll echo my congratulations on the results as well. It's great to 
see.
Maybe, Nikesh, if you could help us reconcile what you're seeing on the product revenue side, particularly within 
the context of your guidance next year, particularly given what you've said about consolidating and sharing your 
platform, early stages of refresh cycle. But it sounds like you got some great VM-Series traction, and the 
percentage of revenue of total Firewall as a Platform business is accelerating. What are the underlying 
assumptions behind that mid- to high-single digit product revenue growth? Where could you see upside? And how 
are things different underlying those expectations compared to what you're seeing today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Brian, as you know, thank you for the question and thank you for your kind words. Look, we had the similar 
set of expectations last year going into this fiscal year and we benefited from some price increases, as you know. 
We also benefited from some pull-through activities by customers because there were supply chain crisis and 
people were trying to make sure they're stocking up. We just want to be prudent. We don't anticipate more price 
increases, because our philosophy is we don't want to keep driving prices up. Because when you keep increasing 
prices, when supply chain settles down, you have to cut prices. And I don't want to be in that scenario where 
we're showing you tremendous volatility [indiscernible] (40:51).
So that's kind of one factor, is the price normalization. The second factor is potential pull-in by customers because 
of supply chain constraints and ordering ahead. If you balance that out, we think the number is still in the low- to 
high-single digits. But again, as I've told you from perhaps five years ago, we are focusing on Firewall as a 
Platform. The more I drive SASE, the more I drive virtual firewalls, the better off we are as transitioning our 
business [ph] as is going to be highlighted (41:16), 70% of our revenue now is predictable going into next quarter, 
we highlighted that 80% of our software subscription is coming from software. So we are trying to make sure we 
keep transforming this business as software business. We love our hardware business. It drives a lot of install 
base. It drives lots of refreshes. It drives a lot of our Advanced Threat Prevention capabilities. So, please don't 
take away, that's not now a favorite child of ours, but at the same time, we are cautious and we're making sure we 
balance the growth in our hardware business with the trust we're putting into SASE and cloud and Cortex.

you put your head together with Dipak to sort of put guardrails around the guidance as the business becomes a 
little bit more levered to some of these larger deals, especially given your scale?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Let me back up. First of all, we were careful. We said mid- to high-30s, so it's not exactly 10%. It's somewhere 
between 5% and 8%, if you will, if you're doing back-of-the-math envelope. But yes, 5% to 8%, but, look, part of it 
is we also told we have 1,200 millionaire customers. I think in cybersecurity, that makes us the largest number of 
millionaire customers you can expect. There's a large amount of customers between that and the million-dollar 
customers. $100 million and $1 million, there are lots of numbers between 1 and 100. So you can expect, we 
have people pretty much at every number.
Part of it is a balancing act in terms of what deals we prioritize and what deals we focus on. Remember, $100 
million deals don't go away. They just take longer. So we either get it done in Q1 or we get it done in Q2. 
Customer doesn't wake up one morning and say, you know what, that deal we've been discussing for the last nine 
months for $100 million, ah, it's not going to happen. It typically becomes a $60 million deal or it's just going to 
happen the following quarter. So our job is to have a lot more pipeline in our portfolio to make sure that we're able 
to bring enough of them in to be able to keep you hungry analysts away from destroying our credibility or 
whatever the right phrase is. Have we got you convinced yet, Fatima or not? I'm still waiting.

Okay. Great. Thanks, Clay. Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question here. I echo my congrats on a very 
strong quarter. Dipak, maybe for you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you took the same approach 
with FY 2023 guide as you did with FY 2022, which was obviously very strong. So, maybe the question for you is, 
as we all contemplate the impact of macro uncertainty for next year, how did you sort of think about that when you 
were kind of thinking about that billings guide for next year, which again was very strong at the higher base for 
2022?

what's supply chain-related, what's inflation-related, what's demand-related, and then just making sure that we

methodically work through it, like Nikesh and I and the leadership team have a lot of debates during the course of

Hey, guys. You have Joe on for Brent. Appreciate the question and congrats on the results. Maybe just a followup to that last question, appreciate the extra prudence, and I know that it's your fiscal first quarter, but is there any 
reason why the growth rate would half? I know there's some duration in 4Q, but just maybe talk about the billings 
guidance as it relates to F 1Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dipak Golechha
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So, I think, again, ultimately we talked about how you've got to normalize it for some large deals. We did also take 
a price increase on August 1. I think again, we're just trying to be prudent at the beginning of the fiscal year and 
make sure that we're not getting ahead of our skis. I mean, the 20% to 21% is the fiscal year guide. I think we've 
guided a little bit higher in Q1 specifically, but I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora

[ph] We had a good base (45:57).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dipak Golechha

look at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
And I think it's important to understand the overall market context, you've got companies which are reducing 
guidance, companies that are cutting EPS guidance, there are companies which are warning of potential 
customer deal life cycles being smaller. So we are trying to make sure that we're prepared for both the upside and 
downside scenario. I think it's fair for us to be prudent in that market.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew James Nowinski
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q
Great. First, I just want to extend my congrats on a great quarter and the billings guidance, particularly in light of 
the much larger comp you have this year. So, for a question, I wanted to ask about your win rates on Prisma 
SASE, because none of your competitors have firewalls or other solutions to offer beyond their SASE solutions. 
So I'm wondering if the rest of your portfolio might actually be your most sustainable competitive advantage that's 
driving that growth and new logos you're seeing with Prisma SASE.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Andy, I think part of – if you look at historically, until about three years ago, we didn't have a SASE product that 
we could actually go head-to-head with the industry leader, let's just say, right. What has happened in the last 
year-and-a-half or two, we've become a force to reckon with. I'd say in the most, the largest enterprise deal is 
head-to-head with two vendors. Very rarely do we see a third. It doesn't take a lot to guess who the second 
vendor is. And three years ago we're not showing up at a party. Two years ago we're getting 1 or 2 deals out of 
10. Now we think we're in 5 to 6 out of 10 deals. And our aspiration is next year to be in 10 out of 10 deals. You 
know what, hopefully if we can win half the deals that we're in, we'll be growing at big numbers like we did this 
year.
So, we think we are coming of age in our SASE business. We have lot of respect for the other player in the 
market. We think we have a better solution technically. We're seeing that enterprise/architecture has come to play 
while customers want to integrate a Zero Trust strategy across hardware, software and remote access-driven 
solutions. We believe that we have a technical edge. At the same time, we made the early decision to deploy that 
on the public cloud. We actually are the only company that can deliver your SASE solution on the public cloud 
with redundancy. So if GCP goes down, we hot switch to AWS. As AWS goes down, we hot switch to GCP. So 
we give you the highest level SLA in the SASE business in the market today.

Joel P. Fishbein
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Q
Sorry about that. Sorry about that, thanks for taking my question. I was on mute. Nikesh, just wanted to follow up 
on Fed spending and SLED spending particularly since Palo Alto is probably in the pole position to deal with the 
Zero Trust environment that the federal government is espousing strategy around. And I would love to just get an 
update. It seems like there's a lot of rhetoric, but not a lot of spending.

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah, Joel, as you'll appreciate, what typically happens when a new administration comes into place, the first six 
months they spend the time getting to know each other. The next six months they'd have a lot of executive orders 
and then we get into implementation, if you're lucky, in year two. So, yes, we have seen great signs of alignment 
in the Fed market. We have seen some good executive orders aligned towards more awareness around 
cybersecurity. As you know, the SEC is also looking at it, how to make it a more relevant conversation in boards. 
So, all the signs are headed in the right direction. The fiscal year close for Fed comes in, in the next month and a 
half. So we should hopefully see some activity in Q1 around that. And I think next year should be a better year for 
Fed spending especially around Zero Trust and SASE and cloud.

Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
Great. Lee, I wanted to bring you into the conversation for a second, if I could. Lots of good metrics around 
Cortex, and I was just wondering how you're thinking about the growth potential in Cortex and particularly with 
XSIAM coming in the first half. Does that you think actually cause an acceleration in growth in Cortex?
And, Dipak, if I could just ask a clarification, sneak one in here, for the billings guide, are you assuming duration 
neutral in FY 2023 or any kind of assumptions around duration and pricing that we should be thinking about in 
that 20% to 21% billings guide when you compare this year to last year? Many thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Keith. We saw another year of good traction with Cortex across XDR, XSOAR and 
Xpanse. And I anticipate that we'll continue to see that traction in FY 2023 given the product innovation that we've 
driven and will continue to drive across those three products and the value they provide. When I think about

XSIAM, I think of it as being the start of a fairly exciting journey, but it's going to be a multiyear journey. I don't see 
it as being just a quick hit. It's a...

....more architectural transformation. It is truly what I believe customers need. But it will take a little bit longer for 
that to fully play out. And I am very encouraged by the design partner program we ran. But we're going to see that 
play out over the course of the next year, and hopefully that sets the foundation for years to come.

Okay. Great.

Dipak Golechha
Chief Financial Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
And then, just to answer your question on duration and pricing, no significant changes on duration and no 
additional pricing beyond the ones that we've already announced. Recall August 1 we did have a price increase 
that was about 5% on our hardware.

Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
All right. Thanks, Clay. So, Nikesh, at the beginning of your fiscal 2022 year, you spoke about a more incremental 
period, a more moderate period, if you will, as it relates to acquisitions. But earlier Lee did also mention several 
opportunities for new modules and valuation multiples having generally come in, curious how you're thinking 
about M&A in fiscal 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
So, we outlined that we – it's harder to do M&A now than it was three or four years ago, because we had such a 
wide canvas or blank canvas in terms of various opportunities where we could go make acquisitions. Today we

have to balance the idea of an acquisition to make sure that is it consistent with our product strategy and – or is it 
an overlapping acquisition or is it a complementary acquisition where we can integrate over time. So, that reduces 
the amount of the opportunity out there. And I've always said, we're very focused on product area acquisitions as 
opposed to go-to-market acquisitions, because we have a, as you can see, from our ARR on NGS, $1.9 billion. 
We have the ability to go sell good stuff if we get good stuff from our product better than here.
So, I think we will continue to stay on the lookout and scan the market. We are not in the mindset of acquiring 
large deals. We're in the mindset of looking for great product teams that we can complementarily attach to our 
capabilities. So we keep scanning the market, and if something shows up, we'll do it. But, again, I don't think it 
has ever been a significant part of our effort in terms of our market cap. When we did the [ph] first $2.5 billion, the 
market cap was $20 billion, $25 billion, and now it's north of $50 billion (53:28). So you can imagine it's a small 
scale relative to what the opportunity of the company is. And that's how we think about it. We're not chomping at 
the bit right now. The market, I think, it's kind of like the public market has rationalized, the private markets 
probably haven't yet. And it's a bit like real estate, people remember the last – the neighbor's house, what it's sold 
at, they kind of forget what their house is worth. So until people realize the true value of their house, it's going to 
be little longer before acquisitions come into the security market again.

Matthew Hedberg
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Sure. Hi. Thanks, Clay. Hey, Nikesh and team, congrats on the results. The success of your SASE portfolio is 
obviously impressive. I'm wondering if you approach the new fiscal year, are there things that you're doing from a 
go-to-market perspective to even drive higher cross-sell? I believe you have about 54,000 firewall customers and 
now just shy of 3,600 SASE customers. Just kind of curious how you think about maybe driving even more crosssell than what has obviously been [ph] top line growth (00:54:32)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes. So, Matt, thank you for the question. It's a great question. It's something our management team has spent a 
lot of time thinking about and what we are doing going into this fiscal year is we used to have SASE sales 
specialists and what we've done is we have merged them into our core sales team and we've been running boot 
camps for the last six to eight weeks training everybody out on the field for SASE. So we're converting our entire 
core field team, our network security team into a SASE-first team, which is the only way we can get amplification 
across 2,000 sellers and actually go make sure there is a SASE opportunity to be uncovered at every customer.
So, we think SASE has come of age. We think SASE is the linchpin towards our network security strategy. We 
think this is going to be a very, very large market in the next 5 to 10 years and we think we're one of two vendors 
in the market who will be invited to every opportunity, and we hope to win our disproportionate share.

Right. Yeah, great. And our last question for the day from Gray Powell with BTIG. Gray, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gray Powell
Analyst, BTIG LLC Q
All right. Thank you very much and congratulations on the strong results. So, yeah, I guess, I'll stick with the 
SASE theme, and I'd be really curious. I mean, a lot of other companies that have reported earnings in the 
security space, they're talking about longer sales cycles, particularly for larger more complex deals. How does 
that play into the Prisma SASE portfolio? Are you seeing any macro impact there, particularly in terms of pipeline? 
And then was that like a consideration in the NGS ARR guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, Gray, as I said, first and foremost, the large complex deals take longer to get done, and SASE does take 
longer because customers – SASE is just not buying a security and bolting it on. It's actually re-architecting your 
network access. Actually this is how your laptop dials in into your work if you're using Palo Alto SASE or Prisma 
SASE. So it's kind of important, because if your laptop doesn't get access to BTIG's infrastructure, you're in 
trouble. So it becomes a network play as much as security play so teams take a little longer to get it done. So I 
think that's kind of part of the process, less so the macroeconomic concerns if you will. It's really doing the 
technology transformation, agreeing to do it as an organization. That's what takes a little longer.
In terms of our guidance, look, there's a whole bunches of puts and takes that are going in there. There's secular 
tailwinds. We obviously have a sense of the pipeline going into next year. As Fatima asked, we did some big 
deals. Guess what, we didn't do some big deals, right. We couldn't have done every deal. So there's a bunch of 
deals that are still waiting in the wings. Yes, they're larger and they're binary that if they all don't come in, we'll 
have to go hustle. If they all come in, we'll be in a great place. But our job as management is to balance all these 
factors. We got to balance inflation, supply chain, deal cycles, various product investments. So I think across the 
balance, if you look, we think that our guidance is prudent across all these factors, where we think some of them 
might be better for us, some of them may be worse. Part of the margin we think we can deliver the guidance as 
presented to you.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone. Seattle Genetics has entered a new decade as a multi-product 
oncology company. In December, we expanded our commercial portfolio, FDA approval of PADCEV for 
metastatic urothelial cancer, tucatinib for metastatic breast cancer is on the horizon in 2020 as a potential third 
drug approval and ADCETRIS remains an important brand globally that has been used in the treatment of more 
than 60,000 lymphoma patients worldwide. Behind these three products is a robust pipeline of novel programs 
that we believe have the potential to help more people with cancer.
2019 was a banner year and our progress has positively impacted future potential of Seattle Genetics. Starting in 
2020, our revenues from product sales will be more diverse as we add PADCEV and, if approved, tucatinib to a 
strong ADCETRIS base. PADCEV was approved in late December, roughly three months ahead of its PDUFA

date. [indiscernible] (00:02:41) sales team with our partner Astellas is actively engaged with oncologists in both 
the academic and community settings. We're very pleased by the positive reception to this important drug and by 
the number of accounts and increasing number of vials ordered in the first full month of sales. We are early in the 
launch phase of PADCEV and have decided not to give sales guidance until we gain more experience in the 
marketplace.
In parallel with our PADCEV launch activities, we are investing in a broad clinical development program with a 
focus in urothelial cancer. Today, we're announcing a recent completion of enrolment of our randomized Phase 3 
trial called EV-301. This trial is intended to confirm the accelerated approval of PADCEV and support global 
applications for approval.
Importantly, we have initiated a Phase 3 trial in first line metastatic disease which is key to our global 
development strategies. This trial is being conducted under a collaboration between Seattle Genetics, Astellas 
and Merck, with each party providing significant funding. In addition to these registrational trials, we are evaluating 
PADCEV in earlier stage bladder cancer and believe there is also potential in other nectin-4 expressing solid 
tumors.
Next is tucatinib which is in line to become the third drug in our commercial portfolio. This program has advanced 
significantly in just the past couple of months based on outstanding data from the HER2CLIMB pivotal trial in 
metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer including patients with brain metastasis. Full results from the trial were 
featured in an oral presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December and simultaneously 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
HER2CLIMB which supported FDA breakthrough therapy designation positions tucatinib as the potential best-inclass HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Based on HER2CLIMB results, in December we completed submission of 
the NDA, which is being reviewed under the FDA's real time oncology review program. Another significant 
regulatory accomplishment with tucatinib was the January submission and recent EMA validation of the MAA in 
Europe.
We're also participating in Project Orbis, an FDA-sponsored program that provides a framework for its submission 
and review of oncology drugs among the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore and Australia. We have 
now submitted tucatinib in each of these countries positioning the drug for global approvals beginning later this 
year. Our goal is to bring tucatinib to patients in need around the world.
With that in mind, we're in the process of expanding our European capabilities through our teams in the 
Netherlands, Switzerland and United States for prosecuting our MAA submission and we're adding leadership in 
key countries. As with PADCEV, we are conducting a broad global development program with tucatinib. Roger will 
provide additional details on the clinical development activities and Todd will speak to the investments we are 
making in these important programs.
Moving on, now to ADCETRIS. We're pleased to report record 2019 revenues in US and Canada of $628 million, 
up 32% over 2018. This follows a 55% growth rate in 2018 driven by adoption in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and 
peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Taken together with sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory, global sales in 
2019 exceeded $1 billion underscoring its importance to physicians and patients around the world. We expect 
2020 ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada to be in the range of $675 million to $700 million. While this 
reflects more modest growth, we believe that our ongoing and planned clinical trials with ADCETRIS will provide 
opportunities for additional expansion of the brand. We also expect to report five-year progression free survival

results late this year from the ECHELON-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. This is an important milestone for 
lymphoma patients and could further establish the positive long term benefit of ADCETRIS plus AVD.
Our clinical stage pipeline is robust and we're conducting trials across a spectrum of both hematologic 
malignancies and solid tumors. Most advance of these programs is tisotumab vedotin or TV, we are developing in 
collaboration with Genmab.
Our initial focus is in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. We expect to report topline data from a potentially 
pivotal Phase 2 trial in the first half of 2020. We are also evaluating TV in other solid tumors including ovarian and 
head and neck cancer with activities underway to optimize dose and schedule.
In 2019 we initiated trials with several novel agents. We intend to continue our investment in innovative new 
product candidates including ADCs and other targeted therapies with four INDs planned in 2020 and another four 
in 2021. These early stage programs are based on efficient clinical trial design that are intended to inform clear, 
rapid development decisions. We're also pleased with the progress of ADC collaborator programs, namely the US 
and recent EU approval of Roche's Polivy and the ongoing priority review by FDA and recent MAA validation of 
GSK belantamab mafodotin. Both of these ADCs employee Seattle Genetics proprietary technology. There are 
more than 10 ADCs using our technology in clinical development by us and our collaboration partners.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a license agreement with BeiGene, our first collaboration with 
a company in China, an increasingly important market for anti-cancer therapy. This included an upfront payment 
of $20 million and we are eligible for progress-dependent milestones. This program recently entered a Phase 1 
clinical trial.
I'm proud of our exceptional progress in 2019. We're diversifying our commercial portfolio and revenue drivers, 
addressing meaningful unmet medical needs and investing across our portfolio to fuel future growth. We are wellpositioned to continue transforming Seattle Genetics into an important biotechnology company focused on helping 
cancer patients around the world.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Robin to discuss our commercial activities. Then, Todd will comment on our 
financial results and 2020 guidance. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities. Robin?

Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Clay. We're excited to provide an update on our commercial activities. ADCETRIS' net sales in the US 
and Canada were $166 million in the fourth quarter, increase of 26% compared to the same quarter in 2018. Total 
year sales were $628 million, an increase of 32% over 2018. Growth was driven by our frontline indications in 
Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL.
The four-year follow-up data from the ECHELON-1 trial that were presented at ASH, complement the value 
proposition that ADCETRIS offers patients. And clinical benefit of ADCETRIS + AVD over ABVD enables 
meaningful discussions with physicians who have been slow to adopt the ADCETRIS + AVD regimen. We also 
look forward to the five-year data later this year. For 2020, we are focused on continuing to promote ADCETRIS 
under its broad label that now includes six indications here describing the clear and durable advantage of 
ADCETRIS + AVD in the frontline setting for patients with Stage 3 and 4 Hodgkin lymphoma. In frontline PTCL, A 
+ CHP is the standard of care for patients with ALCL and we are working hard to drive use in additional CD30-
expressing subtypes while engaging with pathology labs to improve the reporting of CD30. For these efforts, we 
intend to continue growing the ADCETRIS franchise.

Now I'd like to transition to PADCEV, which was approved late in 2019. Seattle Genetics and Astellas sales forces 
are active in the field. Reaction from physicians is very positive and the number of accounts that have ordered 
PADCEV from both academic and community sites has exceeded our expectations in January, our first full month 
of launch.
We estimate that there are approximately 3,200 accounts in the United States that treat metastatic bladder cancer 
patients and may order PADCEV. In the short period of time that we've been in the market, our representatives 
have already called on 1,500 of these accounts. We're also pleased with the rapid inclusion of PADCEV in the 
NCCN treatment guidelines. There is significant unmet need in metastatic urothelial cancer post platinum 
chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy. The team is focused on driving awareness and understanding about 
this important new treatment option. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
Moving on to tucatinib, commercial team is excited by the clinical data from HER2CLIMB and the positive reaction 
to our presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Our sales leadership team is in 
place and we are hiring the US sales force. We're attracting top sales talent with significant oncology experience, 
metastatic HER2 positive patients, especially those with brain metastases needs new treatment options, and our 
team eagerly awaits the approval. In summary, the growing commercial team at Seattle Genetics is wellpositioned for a transformative year, as we bring meaningful products to patients in areas of unmet need. Now I'll 
turn over the call to Todd.

Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
All right. Thanks, Robin, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Today, I'll summarize our 
financial results for the fourth quarter and full year in 2019 and then I'll provide our financial outlook for 2020.
Total revenues were $290 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $917 million for the full year. This included 
ADCETRIS net sales of $166 million in the fourth quarter and $628 million for the year.
PADCEV was launched during the holiday period at the end of the year, and therefore only provided a modest 
contribution to sales. Royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $72 million, compared to $25 
million the fourth quarter of 2018. This included a onetime $40 million milestone from Takeda that was triggered 
by annual sales of ADCETRIS exceeding $400 million in its territory in 2019. For the full year in 2019, royalty 
revenues were $138 million, compared to $83 million a year ago. This growth reflects the sales milestone, higher 
sales by Takeda in 2019 and the royalty rate on sales above $400 million, increasing to mid-20%.
Royalties from Roche on Polivy also contributed to 2019 results. Collaboration revenues were $51 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 and $150 million for the full year. These revenues included $55 million in milestones from 
Takeda related to international approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, FDA approval of Roche's 
Polivy, and the initiation of GSK's phase 3 trial with their ADC utilizing our technology.
Additionally, we recognized $20 million in upfront payments from BeiGene upon entering into a product licensing 
agreement in the fourth quarter. R&D expenses were $201 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $719 million 
for the year. Growth over 2018 reflected higher investment across our late-stage pipeline, most notably for 
PADCEV and tucatinib, which included the pivotal trials that led to the PADCEV approval and the tucatinib 
submissions. SG&A expenses were $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $374 million for the full year. 
These are both increases over 2018 and reflect commercialization efforts related to the ADCETRIS frontline 
indications and preparations for the launches of PADCEV and tucatinib. We ended 2019 with $868 million in cash

and investments. In addition, we held approximately $163 million in Immunomedics' common stock. These shares 
are mark-to-market which resulted in a non-cash gain that contributed to investment income of $64 million for the 
fourth quarter and that led us to reporting net income as you saw in our press release this afternoon.
Regarding our financial outlook for 2020, I'll begin with revenue guidance. There are three main components. 
First, we expect ADCETRIS' net sales in the US and Canada to be in the range of $675 million to $700 million. At 
this time, we're not providing PADCEV guidance. Second, we expect royalty revenues to be in the range of $105 
million to $115 million, based primarily on anticipated sales growth of ADCETRIS by Takeda. And third, we expect 
revenues from collaboration and license agreements to be in the range of $30 million to $50 million.
Turning now to expenses. We expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $860 million to $950 million. This 
primarily reflects planned investment in PADCEV and tucatinib, including several registrational trials, as well as 
investment across our earlier stage portfolio. Similarly, SG&A expenses are expected to increase to a range of 
$475 million to $525 million. This includes full year costs of PADCEV's commercial infrastructure, building our 
tucatinib commercial team, and expanding our European capabilities. We expect ADCETRIS' cost of sales to be 
in the range of 5% to 6% of sales. As a reminder, Seattle Genetics booked sales of PADCEV in the US and we 
will record Astellas' 50% share of gross profit as a component of cost of sales. Marketing and development 
expenses are also shared equally. These are netted out in our SG&A and R&D expenses and have been 
reflected in our guidance.
So, to wrap up, we have bold plans in 2020 and an opportunity to significantly expand the potential of our drugs to 
help patients. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roger who will provide some of the specifics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. As Clay described, 2019 was an exceptional year for Seattle 
Genetics in achieving our goal of bringing important new medicines to people with cancer. Today, I will mostly 
focus my remarks on PADCEV and tucatinib as we have ambitious development plans for each of these exciting 
drugs.
I'll begin with PADCEV where our first priority is evaluating this product across the continuum of urothelial cancer. 
There are three main components to our strategy. First, under the FDA's accelerated approval program, a 
confirmatory trial is required and we and Astellas are conducting the global randomized Phase 3 trial called EV301 in metastatic urothelial cancer patients who've received a platinum-containing regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitor.
Today, we announced the study has completed enrollment of 608 patients. Primary endpoint of EV-301 is overall 
survival. And in addition to serving as a confirmatory trial, it is intended to support global applications for approval. 
Second, our next goal is to move PADCEV into first line metastatic urothelial cancer. Based on encouraging data 
from a combination of PADCEV and Keytruda which will be updated next week at ASCO GU, we recently initiated 
a Phase 3 trial together with Astellas and Merck evaluating this combination with or without chemotherapy. Target 
enrolment is approximately 1,100 patients and importantly, for its first-line patients, regardless of platinum 
eligibility, PD-L1 expression or nectin-4 expression [indiscernible] (00:17:45) evaluate dual primary endpoints of 
progression free survival and overall survival.
And third, our goal is to evaluate PADCEV in early stages of urothelial cancer beginning muscle invasive bladder 
cancer. These patients despite treatment including surgical removal of the bladder, there is a high risk of 
recurrence with metastatic disease. We recently initiated clinical evaluation of both PADCEV monotherapy and

the combination of PADCEV and Keytruda prior to surgery. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer also represents 
a future development opportunity for PADCEV that we are currently evaluating clinically. In these patients, 
available therapies are difficult to tolerate and may fail resulting in a significant unmet medical need.
Beyond urothelial cancer, we believe the potential for PADCEV extends to other cancer types. We and Astellas 
recently initiated a signal seeking trial called EV-202 in a range of nectin-4 expressing solid tumors including 
breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, gastric cancer.
I'll move on now to tucatinib, our oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. We were gratified by the 
enthusiastic reception at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December for the remarkable results from 
HER2CLIMB pivotal trial.
HER2CLIMB data give us conviction to expand upon our clinical development program in HER2 positive breast 
cancer and other HER2 positive cancers. The key areas of clinical focus include: first, evaluating tucatinib in a 
randomized Phase 3 trial in combination with T-DM1 versus T-DM1 alone in metastatic breast cancer. In this trial 
called HER2CLIMB-02, patients must have previously received a taxane and a trastuzumab in the adjuvant or 
metastatic setting and thus represent population receiving first or second line treatments.
Second, tucatinib in combination with standard treatment is being evaluated in neoadjuvant breast cancer through 
the I-SPY 2 trial. In addition, we are considering a trial in adjuvant HER2 positive breast cancer.
Third, the initial data from 23 patients treated with a combination of trastuzumab and tucatinib in metastatic 
colorectal cancer were very encouraging. After consultation with the FDA, we have expanded the existing clinical 
trial called MOUNTAINEER to enroll up to 110 patients to third line metastatic disease. Importantly, this trial is 
intended to support a potential accelerated approval. We are also working on plans for a confirmatory trials in 
colorectal cancer. And lastly, we are planning trials in HER2-positive solid tumors including gastric cancer.
Next, I'll turn to ADCETRIS which was the subject of many important presentations at the ASH Annual Meeting in 
December. Of note, the four-year progression-free survival data from the ECHELON-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin 
lymphoma were presented and continued to show sustained, clinically meaningful benefits of ADCETRIS plus 
AVD over ABVD.
Peripheral neuropathy, a known side effect of treatment with ADCETRIS continued to improve over time with 
most patients experiencing complete resolution. Very recently, the NCCN guidelines for both Hodgkin lymphoma 
and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were revised with a number of positive ADCETRIS update. These included 
elderly frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and CTCL.
Our ongoing and planned clinical development program with ADCETRIS includes retreatments, use in patients 
who are unfit for combination chemotherapy, novel frontline Hodgkin lymphoma combinations and relapse 
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Clay.

Thanks, Roger. Before we open the line for your questions, I want to recap key upcoming activities across our 
oncology portfolio. They include first, continue our strong PADCEV launch in the United States with Astellas and 
advancing a broad development program including a Phase 3 trial in first line metastatic urothelial cancer.

Second, work with FDA and other regulatory agencies on tucatinib approval and advance its robust clinical 
development program. Third, continue to establish ADCETRIS as a standard of care frontline Hodgkin lymphoma 
and frontline PTCL and initiate additional clinical trials; and fourth, report top line results from the TV pivotal trials 
in cervical cancer in the first half of this year.
As we've highlighted today, we are executing on our bold vision for the future of Seattle Genetics. At this point, 
we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] and our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of 
America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Geoff Meacham
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Thanks so much for the question. I just got a couple. So the first one is on the ADCETRIS guidance, just wanted 
to ask at a high level, when you talk about your expectations for PTCL and maybe commercially what's been the 
trend in the field going into 2020?
And then on tucatinib, it seems like HER2 duration in the real world and for other therapies is different than just 
looking at PFS, and so are there any commercial lessons to be learned from tie curve or others that can be 
leveraged when you look to the tucatinib launch? Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. So, we'll start with the ADCETRIS question and their guidance and trends, and stuff like that. First of all, I 
would like to step back and put ADCETRIS into context. This is a brand that continues to grow in the US and 
internationally. 2019 was the first year that we hit over $1 billion in global sales and this – really the last two years 
we doubled the sales of ADCETRIS.
2020 guidance reflects 7% to 11% growth over 2019 and that comes off of years when we had 32% and 55% 
gross, double sales in the last two years.'
In frontline Hodgkin, we have four-year PFS data that we presented in December at the ASH Conference. And 
later this year, we expect a five-year data. That's the gold standard, five-year data in Hodgkin lymphoma and 
frontline. So that should be helpful [indiscernible] (00:23:49). In PTCL, I think you mentioned that, that's still 
growing and we have opportunities to increase the use, especially in non-ALCL as data continue to look good. But 
it is not the simplest exercise to displace decades old standard of care, they are entrenched and we've been 
doing a great job in that and we'll continue to do that.
Importantly, with ADCETRIS looking to the future, thinking about guidance, we are continuing to do clinical trials 
and expanding our opportunities with these trials. Some of these opportunities are incremental, but some of them 
are big. We're looking at things including DLBCL, elderly Hodgkin lymphoma, retreatment and there's early stage 
1 and 2 Hodgkin lymphoma. So, a lot of different things that we are doing. And like I said, some bigger 
opportunities like early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where we're not in, in half of Hodgkin lymphoma in frontline and 
some are smaller.

So, overall, Geoff, ADCETRIS is really – it's a terrific first product for Seattle Genetics. And we're so excited to be 
expanding our product to include PADCEV, and looking into the future, tucatinib. You asked about tucatinib and 
duration and what lessons we could learn by that. I mean we're not giving guidance on that. We're not, at this 
point, saying how long we think patients will stay on this. It's a tablet that's taken twice a day, it's got a very good 
profile of efficacy and safety. Our data are really remarkable. And I think we'll learn a little bit of how this can be 
used initially and we have this broad development program.
And Roger, perhaps you want to talk a little bit about just what you think you see with duration of use or what the 
parameters are as we look at it in different settings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks, Clay. One of the key aspects of tucatinib is it's tolerability. It has, obviously, very high efficacy, including 
in patients with brain metastasis, unique population frankly, to be studied in breast cancer, but tolerability is also 
key. And we actually believe the tolerability of the molecule plays into its efficacy. The patients can stay on the 
drug for protracted periods of time and that continues to suppress the HER-2 signaling access.
We have patients in the program anecdotally who've been on the drug for years. So, we are comfortable that 
extended duration of therapy is quite achievable in the clinical trial itself based on progression-free survival, the 
average duration of treatment [ph] amount to about (00:26:25) seven months. But, obviously, as we move into 
other areas where the duration of therapy it may be dictated by the disease state. We're comfortable that tucatinib 
can be used for prolonged periods of time.

Operator: All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.

Salveen Richter
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, with regard to your ADCETRIS 2020 guide, can you just 
comment on why you're accounting for such limited growth at approximately 10% at the midpoint just given this 
over 30% growth you saw last year? And is this conservatism or are there some dynamics at play here. And then, 
secondly, anything you can give us regarding the early launch metrics or just qualitative feedback as you're 
looking and launching PADCEV?

Sure. On ADCETRIS and our guidance, maybe, Todd, you'll want to hop in here and give some commentary 
about this. I don't want to portray this as us doing anything but providing the best we can do, not conservative or 
not anything. I think that this is a brand that first got approved in 2011 and we have been growing and growing 
and growing the brand both in US and international. It is still growing but the growth has slowed down – the rate of 
growth has slowed down. But unlike a lot of brands that have been around for eight years, this is a brand we're 
still investing in it. We have a lot of new findings and new data. And we're really excited by that. And perhaps 
Todd could comment on it and Roger could talk about some very recent additions to NCCN. Maybe we'll start 
there.
Roger, you talk about the NCCN, and Todd, we'll see if he has some color if he wants to put on this.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. And so, it is interesting. It's amazing actually that the NCCN guidelines continue to reflect data that is put 
out in the public domain that is valuable for patients that may not necessarily be a registration trial. A good 
example of that is the use of ADCETRIS together with OPDIVO in the relapse refractory Hodgkin lymphoma 
circumstance where the level of evidence has been raised from a [ph] 2b today (00:28:36) which basically means 
you have complete consensus on the value of that.
In addition, in populations that struggle to take combination therapies such as older patients, another novel way of 
using ADCETRIS which is to use it sequentially with chemotherapy, ADCETRIS followed by AVD has also made 
into the guidelines and that actually represents not just older patients with stage 3, 4 disease but includes a 
reference to stage – to earlier Hodgkin lymphoma with unfavorable [ph] prognostic (00:29:06) features in that 
older population. And then in CTCL, interestingly, our cancer trial is not directly referenced for the usage in the 
primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and there's an acknowledgement which we know well that our cancer trial 
although was done with a cut point of 10%, the guidelines now reflects the state that we know that patients who 
have expression levels below 10% still do respond. So the guidelines have acknowledged that that population is 
probably broader than just [indiscernible] (00:29:36). And those NCCN guideline additions were this week. So this 
is brand new. I think it was yesterday or the day before, and – so brand new additions, three additions to the 
guidelines for ADCETRIS. Todd, maybe additional color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. I guess, Salveen, I just commented ADCETRIS is a big important drug that helps a lot of patients globally. 
As Clay mentioned, we're over $1 billion now globally. We're very proud of that. In the US and Canada, we 
doubled sales over the last two years, we had 32% growth in 2019 and that was 55% in 2018. So there's been a 
lot of growth and we're continuing to invest in trials that Roger mentioned that we think can give us growth in the 
future. But maybe 2019 is a little bit of a catch your breath year after what's been a pretty remarkable run.
I think ADCETRIS provides an incredible base for us to build off of. We've now got PADCEV approved. We're 
looking to tucatinib approval and we're in a very enviable position where given our strength and what we have in 
front of us, we can really invest aggressively in trying to drive PADCEV and tucatinib into really big important 
meaningful drugs that help patients globally.
So I think, ADCETRIS in an important base to that story.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks, Todd. And going to your second question, on early PADCEV uptake and what's going on there. First of 
all, I want to say that we have not provided financial guidance and we're not going to yet, but we want to and we 
want to provide it at the soonest possible opportunity and we want to provide it when we have conviction. And that 
way we'll give you a meaningful guidance. And we really – we were just approved toward the end of the year and 
docs first were just organizing their patients. So, the first full month really was January where we had sales and 
it's only now February. But having said that, we are incredibly pleased with the uptake. We kind of have made 
some internal predictions which are not – with conviction and PADCEV far exceeded our internal predictions. So, 
so far, we've been really happy with it.

Like Robin said, there's about 3,200 accounts in the US that can be called upon and out of that, about 2,800 of 
the accounts we predict have the vast majority of sales. So those are the ones that we're really focused on, those 
2,800 out of the 3,200. And we have in the first five weeks, we've seen 1,500 of those. So we're out there in full 
force, talking about this really important – important drug at the same time that we have this full development 
plan. We'll turn it over to the next caller.

Operator: Yes, sir. Our next question will come from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kennen Mackay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. ADCETRIS' revenue was down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Can you maybe 
just help us understand what's happening on a volume basis and whether there's any impact from inventory or 
gross-to-net in Q4? And on the areas for ADCETRIS growth, I was wondering from the team's conversations, 
what needs to be seen in the five-year ECHELON-1 data to win over some of the prescribers who have been the 
reluctant adopters of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin's?
And then secondly on DLBCL, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the decision to pursue 
ADCETRIS there after walking away from potentially registrational trial in that indication several years ago? Then 
I had a quick follow-up. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Right. As far as the revenue and gross-to-net and all that – Todd, do you want to make a quick comment? We've 
really discussed this a lot already. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Look, I guess, I wouldn't get too hung up in quarterly variability. There are different numbers of sales days. I don't 
want to get into that. But I'd say, to specifically answer your question, gross-to-net was fairly stable. The book of 
business was fairly stable. Coming into year-end, you see a little bit of stocking. I think it was probably 
comparable to what we saw a year ago. So, I don't think that created any significant variability. So, I think – look 
at this year-over-year, and there we had – we put up some pretty good numbers for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
And your second question was about ADCETRIS' five-year data and like what's important. And what I will tell you 
is, what's important is obviously efficacy and safety. On the safety front, right away, this has no bleomycin. That is 
a bad actor. I mean that is a problematic drug for a lot of patients. You see some morbidity with it, patients have 
permanent lung scarring and permanent change in their life, and they also have late problems that come up by 
taking bleomycin, so not taking bleomycin is something that literally every doctor we've talked to, all agree, is a 
good thing.
And what we are presenting is PFS. Now, you may recall that when we first had our data come out with E1 a 
while ago, we had an agreement with FDA at looking at something called modified PFS and we got a lot of hassle 
from on why was it modified PFS and not regular PFS and all that. Our data is strong, whether it's modified or 
regular PFS, but starting I think with the three-year, we started using regular PFS just because that's what

everyone asked for. And then the four-year was regular PFS and the five-year will be regular PFS. So, no one will 
say to us, hey, well, how are these different? What is the difference?
We're using what is standard. And if you see, a 5%, 6%, 7% difference in the long-term survival, in that five years, 
you could start saying it's a defined cure. Obviously, we all die of something. But oncologists look at the five-year 
progression-free survival and they equate that with cure. And we're going to be up to that. So, if you can increase 
the defined cure rate at five years by 5%, 6%, 7%, whatever what is that we see in comparison to the year four 
data that we have, at the same time there's no bleomycin, that's a win. So that's what we look at.
Now, you asked about DLBCL and ADCETRIS and what we're looking at. Perhaps, Roger, you want to talk about 
the efficient study we want to do and what we're looking for in that trial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks, Clay. So, relapsed DLBCL has a meaningful number of patients, DLBCL in general, that express CD13. 
That's the first thing. And we know that ADCETRIS [ph] is active (00:36:13) we have data demonstrating that 
DLBCL is an appropriate place to evaluate it. Beyond that, we actually know patients with a lower level of 
expression can also respond.
So we're planning an all comer trial and we'll show to account for the CD30 expression, but we think ADCETRIS, 
based on its profile of efficacy and safety profile, is a great option for a group of patients who have failed therapy 
and are in the space around things like CAR-T treatments are and so acknowledging the fact that this was an 
attempt that was made earlier wasn't prosecuted, I don't think in anyway diminishes the value of us taking 
ADCETRIS into the [indiscernible] (00:36:54). Actually, we're excited. We think that the data that supports the trial 
is very strong. We obviously need to conduct the trial, but I think we're optimistic we may be able to get 
ADCETRIS to appropriately help patients in regards to DLBCL.

Kennen, you had a quick follow-up and let's make it short one because there's a lot of other analysts who want 
to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kennen Mackay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
No. Appreciate the color. And lastly, I was just wondering if you could comment on what the next steps are in the 
ongoing dispute resolution with Daiichi Sankyo. Our work is very much sided with your stance within that 
resolution, so just wondering next steps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yes. So, Kennen, we certainly saw your report and it was very interesting. We did not know you were working on 
that, so it was interesting for us to see that. And your conclusion is similar to our conclusion that we have a very, 
very good case. What I would say to you is that legal issues take time and go through a process. We believe that 
this should be an arbitration based on our 2008 agreement with them and we're making steps toward that. And 
they publicly stated that they would rather have this in court but – and the court will rule on it soon whether it's 
[indiscernible] (00:38:11) or court. But other than that, it's hard for me to give you inside guidance on this except 
for that we believe we have a very strong case in the history of Seattle [ph] Gecs (00:38:22), 22 years, we have

never proactively gone out and done a legal move like this. We are not a litigious company. But protecting our IP

Operator: Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from Andrew Berens with SVB Leerink.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm not going to ask one on ADCETRIS. I think we had a lot of 
questions already obviously. But, can you give us some idea of how the payer discussions are going for 
PADCEV? Has there been any pushback on the price point that you chose? And then I do have a question on 
tucatinib.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. I'll give a comment and turn it over to Robin. I will tell you, it's been going great. We just haven't had 
pushback on this at all. We think we did a very good job in pricing this drug. If you look at the world of oncology 
drug prices, there's quite a lot of drugs that were priced very high above this, and there are a number of drugs 
priced below it. But for the value that PADCEV brings that we think we put this in a very good spot. Robin, you 
want to add any commentary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yes, absolutely. So we've been monitoring to see if there is any – any issues that are arising with PADCEV and 
what we've seen is really that there are no issues, no pushback that we're seeing. We have PADCEV patient 
solutions in place. So if there are challenges that in account comes across, then we have ways to help them out 
with that. But the reality is that the launch has been going very well and a very positive reception from physicians. 
So you know this a very high unmet need population.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Okay, thanks. And then on tucatinib, when can we expect the MOUNTAINEER to read out now that you've 
expanded it, and what do you think the bar is for an accelerated approval?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, thank you for asking the question on MOUNTAINEER. So we put out data that were very strong at ESMO, 
and I would say it was somewhat unexpected by the audience but there was a lot of interest in MOUNTAINEER 
and Roger and his team went to regulators and talked about this and we have an agreement and we would take 
that trial and expand it. And you know obviously everything is a review decision with regulators but to take an 
existing trial and not restart it, just expanded out to 110 patients and bring it back to regulators as a potential 
approval trial for registration granted we would need a confirmatory trial, but that's pretty incredible and we're 
super jazzed about that.
And so that's opening – open and cranking because it just added on to a trial. And it is a corporate trial that we're 
running. And I really think we have a great chance here. We're not looking for data that's better. This isn't

something where we're taking in different things and combining them and wishing and hoping that we see 
something we haven't seen. We've seen great data in HER2-positive colorectal carcinoma. We have the 
combination of hitting on the outside of the cell and the inside of the cell with trastuzumab and tucatinib.
And so, this is something that we think is a really great opportunity. I mean this double hit on the outside and 
inside, really looks great. Roger, do you want to add to that? I'm sorry I went on about the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I do think when – we obviously can't talk about timing, but what I would say to you, this is now a Seattle Genetics 
trial. So, the full effort of the company and its resources are behind them. So, we'll go with enrollment as best as 
we can and then read the trial out at the appropriate time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Okay. One, just, quick follow-up. I guess, since it's on top of Herceptin, it's obviously a combination, and I guess 
in other indications, other drugs, the FDA has sometimes required some sort of controlled comparison. So, I 
guess what do you think is enough efficacy that they'd be willing to approve this on a single-arm trial?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, Andy, they don't draw lines in the sand with us and write down numbers. But we showed a 52% response rate 
of the combination. And in published reports on using Herceptin alone, I mean you have something that's more 
like 15% response rate. And so, we're like multiples above what we think Herceptin would be. In our trial, we do 
have monotherapy with tucatinib. So, we do know some of the components.
So, a lot of work's done and been presented with Herceptin. We have monotherapy of tucatinib in colorectal and 
we have the combination. I think the regulators have what they need and it feels like that's what they've indicated 
to us. So, obviously, until we get approval, we can't make promises. But to go to regulators and have them say, 
you can expand this ongoing trial and we'll look at the data and your data is pretty special, just bring us more of 
the same, it's pretty darn good. I don't even think and – I don't even think we need data as good as we have had. 
It doesn't have to exactly match, can't obviously, and can't just go away, but we have room there. Okay, next 
question?

Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask about TV since no one's brought that up yet. Maybe 
if you could just talk about what you think is the bar on that study and your confidence level around that when we 
get the data this year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Thank you for asking about TV. TV is an interesting antibody drug conjugate that binds to tissue factor and 
we are working on this with Genmab, a partner of ours that we work very closely with. We presented data on this

in the past but it was part of a dose-escalation and Phase 1, so it is very hard to know all of the factors on this 
data. So we now are doing with our partners, Genmab, a bigger trial, a Phase 2 trial with one dose. So it is a large 
expansion into Phase 2. It is potentially registerable. We obviously have other trials that we're working on and 
combination trials and a variety of things that we're excited about with TV. But this is an important trial for us. I 
think that from this, potentially registrational Phase 2, we need to see something that's meaningful. And I think we 
could start by putting into context to the last drug that was approved for relapsed cervical cancer, and not with 
Keytruda. That was approved based on a 14% response rate for the duration of about a year. And that was in –
they had to screen and that was in the PD-1 high or PD-L1 high, I should say, patients. And so it wasn't even all 
the patient population. For us, we're looking at all patient population. And we showed from our early data which is 
not as big of a trial and not our potentially registerable Phase 2, but we showed something in the 20s percent 
response rate for this dreaded condition.
If we're talking about lymphoma, that's not something people get too excited about. But if we're talking about 
relapsed cervical cancer where there's very little hope and opportunity for patients and you have a drug that could 
give you substantively higher response rate than the last drug that was approved. We'll just have to also watch for 
duration. I think the FDA has not given us a line in the sand, but I would think that if we could get more than and 
we want as much as possible, we'd love to see something very long but I think if we could get more than four, five 
months in duration or four, five, six, I don't know, something more, something substantively with duration and 
something with a response rate with – in the 20s, I think we have a really good shot.
Now, I will tell you that to me that's step one, okay? I want to be able to really help patients with relapsed cervical 
cancer, okay? And to me, that's going to come from probably a combination study in the future. Yes, we want to 
get on the market with this as a single agent. Yes, we want to have another alternative for patients who have no 
other alternatives. But, to me, if we could get this approved and then we could combine it with whether it's 
chemotherapy or I-O therapy or whatever and we could get up to potentially 30%, 40%, 50% response rate in 
patients that literally have no options, that's what I'm looking to do. So we're excited to get this into a drug and try 
to see if we can get this approved. We're also excited to do even better by these patients.

Cory Kasimov
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two quick ones for you. So first of all, 
regarding your ASCO GU update next week for PADCEV, how might this differ from what we saw at ESMO in 
terms of – is it just more patients or just longer follow-up? And then the second question I have, I'm just curious if 
the 2020 guide reflects any sort of planned build-out for TV assuming that trial reads out positive or is that not in 
there yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yes. So the 2020 [indiscernible] (00:47:54) guide and TV and manufacturing, I'll turn over to Todd in a moment. I'll 
start with ASCO GU and PADCEV. We are going to update the trial. At ESMO the trial was a – it was interim data. 
We did not have mature data at the time, but we presented everything and it was incredibly well received. I would 
say we were one of the stars of ESMO and perhaps the star of ESMO, but that's a lot to say. But when we 
present the update of this trial at ASCO GU, I don't think we're going to disappoint anybody. Yeah, Todd, 
guidance?

doing, but we haven't yet factored in a commercial build. We want to get to our data and see how that looks.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two pipeline questions. One, follow-up on TV. We've done some 
work there last year already but I was just wondering if you can help us a little bit with understanding the initial 
market opportunity in cervical cancer, for example how many patients per year might be a treatment candidate 
should TV-204 succeed this year? And then I had a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Well, we're not at the point now where we're giving guidance in the – with specificity that you are asking for. But 
what I will tell you is that there were about 13,000 patients in United States that were diagnosed with cervical 
cancer and this is despite having a vaccine called GARDASIL which is a phenomenal vaccine but not everyone 
gets it. And in fact, when you look around the globe not only is it just not in the US but a lot of other countries, not 
everyone's getting it and in fact in some countries it's not even in the formulary. This includes Japan and Brazil 
and other places.
So, when you start looking at how many patients around the globe are diagnosed last year with cervical cancer, it 
was 575,000. That is a travesty. And we would be very happy to have no business with TV and cervical cancer 
and pack it up and go home if everyone was taking GARDASIL, but that's not the reality and the reality is that this

is a horrible, devastating disease and if you're diagnosed with it, it's a death sentence. And we want to do 
something about it. But like I said, we'd love if everyone in the globe had the vaccine and this disease was wiped 
out just not really where it is. So, when I tell you, not only was there over 13,000 people diagnosed but over 4,000 
patients died in the US – annually in US with cervical cancer.
So, that could give you some idea of a number of patients that are diagnosed and dying each year that I think we 
can address. Clearly, as we get more data, as we get further along, if we're going to be launched, this we'll give 
more detailed assessment.

Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Great, thanks. And then maybe one for Roger regarding PADCEV and the bladder cancer opportunity. I guess 
there's been some news recently. We've seen some results from BAVENCIO maintenance study in frontline 
metastatic patients and then KEYTRUDA was approved in the earlier stage setting. I was just wondering what 
your view is on how some of those things might potentially affect the market opportunity for PADCEV longer 
term?

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks for the question, Michael. So yes, avelumab had a readout using a maintenance approach in one of the 
JAVELIN trials, which is great, that's great. Our trial design is such if you look for example in the frontline studies 
that we're going to conduct will include PFS and OS as an outcome. And we really see – understanding the 
maintenance profile but that's limited to people who have some degree of disease control on the frontend and 
either in response or stable disease, it doesn't address the whole population.
I think we are much more excited to try and get PADCEV to the entire population of metastatic urothelial cancer. 
So I think that's our view and obviously we'll operationalize the trial with those end points in mind.

Yeah. So I believe that you have a very robust ADC platform, historically you rarely do acquisitions. However the 
acquisition of Cascadian is very successful one. So would you revisit your M&A strategy? And I have one follow 
up.

Sure. So we have an ongoing constant evaluation for M&A. We are actively looking. We were looking for a few 
years before we made the move on Cascadian, and when I look at a lot of things, you could say that we have 
done heck of a lot of diligence, and the first time we really were making a move was when we tried to license, it 
wasn't an acquisition, it was a license of cetuximab topotecan from Immunomedics, and we went out at a time 
when nobody in Wall Street really was looking at it. Their share price was like $3 or $4 a share, and we went out 
to do a deal which the courts over turned because of rationale that had nothing to do Seattle Genetics. It was 
more of the activity of the prior deal of Immunomedics, but we did keep our stock position, Todd referred to it. We 
made I think over $200 million or something on that stock position which the courts did not rule on. So we were 
able to keep that which was part of our license deal that got over turned. And yes we would have – it happened 
with that license deal if it had gone on, but it didn't.
But it shows you the power of our diligence, and I give you that story because the next time you heard about our 
diligence with Cascadian, which is another company that was trading at low single-digits and Wall Street was not 
focused on it, Cascadian was a company that started its life as Biomira, and then it struggled to stay afloat and 
became Oncothyreon, and then it struggled and it became Cascadian. And after 30 years or so being a company, 
they had this interesting product, and it was very early and they really needed a company that was bigger with 
more power and a full regulatory and manufacturing and medical and everything staff to get this done right.
So I'm very proud that we took this from a tiny little company and acquired the company with a fair premium to 
their shareholders and made it into something that this is now, we can argue whether this is going to be – it's not 
approved yet, so I can't fully argue yet, but best in class HER2 tyrosine kinase, and probably the type of tablet that 
the scientists at GSK who are trying to make tight curve a couple of decades ago were envisioning, one that had 
high potency to inhibit tyrosine kinase, and one that did not bind the EGF receptor that you could stay away from 
intoxicities associated with that. So we're really excited with what we did. And to that end, we do a great job in 
diligence. And unfortunately, that means we turned [ph] out (00:55:29). So there's a lot out there that has a lot of 
hype, and it looks good initially, but then we dig deep, and we dig incredibly deep, and we find stuff that often that 
is less savory, and we don't go forward. But you can be sure that we are out there looking in full force. And if we 
find something, we are not going to be shy. We are going to go out hard to do it.
And I'll remind you – Todd can also comment if you have any questions, when we decided to acquire Cascadian, 
the next day we went out and raised money for that acquisition, not a penny more, we raised for that acquisition, 
and we were transparent and we said this is what we want to do. And we could go and try to acquire a company 
that's very small or a little bit bigger. I think we have a little bit more space to do it now. Clearly, we're not going to 
buy a massive company, but we have a little bit more space because of bigger market cap and a little bit more –
bigger revenue, et cetera. But if we decide to buy something, you will be sure that we will go to Wall Street right 
away and say, here's what we want, here's why we want it, here's why it fits in, here's how much it's going to be, 
and here's what we want to do financially. So we will be incredibly transparent the way we were with Cascadian, 
and we will go full force to do it the minute we find something.

Todd E. Simpson

Thank you for the question. The reason we had a profit in the fourth quarter was because of the mark-to-market

for the quarter and for the year. That's what resulted in the profitable quarter. So please don't read more into it 
than that because it was the result of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
We had a great quarter certainly, and we had a lot of milestone payments that were one-off that Todd mentioned. 
We had three or four really important payments that we got. So the quarter was a great quarter. There's no doubt. 
We were thrilled with the quarter and all the different revenue streams that we brought in. But we're not on 
ongoing activity when you pull out the mark-to-market. We're not yet profitable. But thank you for bringing that up. 
Okay. Next question.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Messer with Needham & Company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chad Messer
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Great. Good afternoon and congratulations on a strong year. So for PADCEV, that got approved quite a bit ahead 
of its PDUFA date, and you anticipated that, you were ready. Just wondering about tucatinib, especially given that 
it has real time oncology review; you said you've got the senior sales leadership on board for that. When do you 
think you need to be sort of fully commercially ready for tucatinib launch?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So I'll give you a little color on that, maybe Robin could talk about the amazingly strong progress we're making 
with our sales staff on tucatinib. So we went ahead and we used RTOR for ECHELON-2, if you could recall, and 
that one was a supplemental BLA. And at the initiation of this pilot program RTOR and FDA, that's the only things 
you could put into it with supplemental BLAs. And we were able to, from submission gained approval in 11 days. 
We were told that is a record, I think it still stands.
Someone will obviously beat it someday, maybe us, on some other program that's a supplemental BLA. And later, 
FDA added the ability bringing in new chemical entity. It should be RTOR progress. Now, having said that, since 
it's a new chemical entity, it can get a very rapid review, but we still need to have inspections of sites and all of the 
work that you need on the QC/QA front with manufacturing. So it's not going to be an 11-day thing, but it can be 
very accelerated from a standard first approval, and that has the potential, that is why we're involved in RTOR 
because of the potential for it to move forward.
I don't know what the FDA's criteria is for accepting things into RTOR. I can say that ECHELON-2 had strong 
overall survival advantage. And we went in there with that supplemental BLA. And I could tell you, with tucatinib 
we have strong overall survival advantage. So I think that – I can't tell you exactly what FDA would accept into 
RTOR, but the two data sets they've accepted from us are amongst the best we've had in the history of the 
company. So by that regard, maybe they're being picky and they should be for something to put a lot of effort and 
move forward fast. So we're really excited with that and working with FDA. Keep in mind, we submitted that, we 
haven't yet passed the 60 days to where it is filed. So that's coming up in not too distant future from where it's 
accepted to file. So that's the next thing you should hear from us about with tucatinib. But working hard with FDA, 
I can tell you that it is – they are putting a lot of effort into it, we are putting a lot of effort in it, we communicate 
with them a lot. Robin, do you want to talk about the sales staff and our readiness?

Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Very happy to. [indiscernible] (01:00:46) let you know that we've hired our sales leadership team. One of the great 
things about having the HER2CLIMB data is that, it's certainly attracted attention from physicians, and they're 
excited about the data, but also many talented sales reps and other commercial staff are excited about the data 
as well. And so we have a very aggressive plan in terms of hiring. We want to make sure that we are ready for the 
approval whenever that may come. And the great news is that Seattle Genetics already had a very strong 
reputation in terms of the commercial organization. And so that on top of the positive HER2CLIMB data that is 
very strong has meant that we have a lot of interest in the positions that we have open across all of the US. And 
so the real task for us right now is really just getting through a lot of interviews and a lot of hiring decisions. But 
our number one standard is to make sure that we have a very strong, talented and focused tucatinib team, and 
I'm very confident we'll be ready for launch.

Clay B. Siegall

I don't remember exactly where we are, but I do get updates periodically. And I know that the last update I got, 
two-thirds of the sales staff were already onboard. So just to let you know, we're not sitting back waiting, and that 
was a while ago. So we are really making big progress to having that sales staff at full force and getting it there. 
Okay. Next question?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my questions. Just two very quick one; the first one is regarding PADCEV. I know it is still 
very early, but just wondering if you can give any color on average reimbursement process time. And the second 
question is regarding HER2CLIMB-02, I know you tried to go for both first line and second line metastatic breast 
cancer. What is your enrollment assumption for Herceptin-naïve patients and how is the study powered?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. So let's start with PADCEV and your question on the average reimbursements. It is too soon for us to really 
start getting into that. With time with ADCETRIS, we were able to say, here is a standard patient, and here is how 
many cycles of therapy, and here is how much that's worth, and what they paid and all that, and the gross-to-net 
and everything. We were able to really provide details about the duration of therapy and all that with ADCETRIS 
with time, but we had the data. We will do that likely for PADCEV in the future. We just are not there yet to go to 
that. Now, the second question you asked was about HER2CLIMB-02, and so that's the second trial, and not to 
confuse it with the original HER2CLIMB. Roger, can you talk a little bit about maybe the type of patients we have 
that could be first or second line, and maybe some of the inclusion and exclusion, because that's really all we 
could talk about at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. The key component of the population is they have to have seen trastuzumab and the taxane. And that's the 
key inclusion criteria. And so under that circumstance, provided those two drugs have been administered, 
whether it's in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting, you can imagine that they will clearly be patients

who will have seen those prior to [ph] devoting metastatic studies (01:03:56). So that would represent a front line 
population. And then there are clearly patients who will have seen those in the metastatic setting and therefore 
represents the second line population. It's not possible to speculate now what the proportion of patients are, we 
just begun the trial. And thanks for the question around [indiscernible] (01:04:11). So we can't disclose details, but 
I can just assure you, we absolutely powered the trial appropriately based on the assumption that we put into the 
study. So we expect if tucatinib plus T-DM1 is better than T-DM1 alone, we'll be able to clearly show that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Just quickly on PADCEV. Is it your expectation that you guys are going to 
get slotted in behind the FGFR inhibitors in those patients that have FGFR2/3 alterations? And I guess, when you 
gave your addressable patient numbers, I think, in conjunction with the approval call, did that include a haircut for 
those patients specifically as well? And then I just have a quick follow up on tucatinib.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I have quick answers to the first two. We do not know exactly what you're saying, but it is not our assumption that 
we're behind the FGFR. That is not the assumption we're going to take in, so in the calculation, if we did not pull 
out any of those patients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Willey
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
Okay. And then just on tucatinib, I know that there was some discussion at San Antonio that there would be some 
additional updates regarding the CNS subgroup data. I guess, is there any kind of guidance that you can provide 
as to when you might be able to present that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yes, we are doing a lot of work in that regard. Thank you for the question. It's really exciting to have the 
opportunity to actually look at cranial scans and start thinking about what you're getting. I mean, so few drugs 
have an impact on PFS in patients with brain mets that this is one of the rare times you can actually look and say, 
can you have a direct impact on the tumors. And I would say, there's a decent chance that we will be presenting 
that type of work this year. I don't want to say for sure on anything, but I think pretty strongly about that. And 
obviously, we want to publish it as well. But we want to present and publish that work, and that's something we're 
very much looking forward to doing.

Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I am just comparing the two proposed labels in the EU and US. So in the 
EU, it says basically two prior anti-HER2 treatment – I'm sorry, this is about the tucatinib, anti-HER2 treatment 
regimens, in US it's three. So maybe can you talk about whether the two populations are significantly different or 
whether it's a function of just treatment differences between the two geographies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Roger?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So thanks Andy for the question. So the answer is that the labels, the addressable populations are the same. The 
only difference being we're proposing for the labeled indication in the US versus the EU. We chose to simplify the 
indications [ph] compared (01:07:05) to the EU, and that is our proposed indications, and I'll address that in a 
second, based in part on feedback that we got from an early regulatory interaction with the European Medicines 
Agency. I would also just point out that these are proposed labels, these are proposed indications. And the final 
approved indication will, if we get approval, will be determined in conjunction with the various regulatory 
authorities. But just to reiterate, this is not a different patient population. It's not a different treatment paradigm. It's 
just a choice about trying to simplify language in an indication statement. And the key goes around words like 
agents versus regimen.

Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Right. Got it. And just a quick follow up, in terms of the EV-302 study, I guess you could argue that Seattle 
Genetics and Merck probably understand the [ph] UC (01:07:48) landscape the best. So obviously, the goal is to 
get the combination out to patients as soon as possible. But just curious about your thinking on interim analyses 
in that trial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. I would say, right now, that is a fantastic question, but it is not one that we're able to address today. So 
keep that question in your head, your comments and your thoughts on how we could do something quicker, 
whether it's in EV-302, in another trial or whatever. It's something that is under active discussion. So stay tuned. 
We'll be back to you on that.

late last year data from CheckMate 358 Phase 1b/2 trial which kind of has comparable ORR data of [ph] nivo 
(01:08:48) in that cervical cancer settings, obviously given that your Phase 1 trial was a dose-finding trial, so it

might be at lower bound. But could you just contrast like how could these two regimen compare especially maybe 
with a focus on side effects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I don't know off the top of my head the data from that trial. Roger can probably better discuss it. What I point to is 
the last approved drug for cervical cancer, just KEYTRUDA. I don't remember the trial was from, but it was 
showed a 14% response rate and a decent duration. We're trying to show as high response rate and a best of 
duration as we can to these patients that have a huge unmet medical need. Roger, you want to add something?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Right. And Clay is making the point, Silvan, that the history of what's been approved is those [indiscernible] 
(01:09:39) for what it is we wouldn't expect to be measured against. I mean, it's great, if ipi/nivo is active in 
cervical cancer, and there's a way for that combination to move forward in cervical cancer, that's great. But I think 
we're pretty excited about TV, as Clay said, such a high unmet need. And I think our data will stand by itself. I'm 
not sure that there's any need to reference combination immunotherapy at this moment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Silvan Tuerkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Hey, good point. And maybe one last question. The Daiichi that you see making progress, I guess, in breast 
cancer, and I would assume it would take share from T-DM1. Could we see a combination trial with tucatinib in 
the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I think that your question is whether the drug now referred to as ENHERTU from Daiichi and AstraZeneca could 
be a good combination partner with tucatinib, and hit on the outside of the cell with a very active antibody directed 
drug conjugate, and on the inside of the cell with a very active and safe HER-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is I think 
a fantastic trial that if this whether we do it, whether Daiichi does it or whether eight doctors do it independently as 
investigator sponsor trials, it's going to happen in multiple ways. So I look forward to those data. I think those two 
drugs should be tested together. It is the right medicine.

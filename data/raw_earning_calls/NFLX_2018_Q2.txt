PRESENTATION
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Good afternoon, and welcome to Netflix Q2 2018 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today
are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter
is Todd Juenger from Bernstein. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary.
With that, over to you, Todd, for your first question.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
All right. Thanks, Spencer. So let's start with the obvious. So for the first time in, I think, 5 quarters, net additions came in below your own forecast
both in the U.S. and internationally. So whoever wants to, maybe you can help us walk through where was the source of that shortfall and what
you attribute it to. David, you want to hit that?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Yes, sure, Todd. So in general, I would say acquisition, which is up year-on-year but wasn't up as much as we thought it was going to be. So -- and
it was pretty broad across multiple markets. It wasn't any one area of the world. And as you pointed out, after 4 consecutive quarters of under
forecasting the business, we over forecasted the business. And we strive for accuracy. We clearly didn't pad the number. But we think based on
the rolling 12 months of growth that we've had compared to the prior rolling 12 months of growth, the U.S. up slightly, internationally up significantly,
that the background and underlying characteristics of the business haven't changed. Our total addressable market is intact and hasn't really changed
based on those 90 days of actuals. And in general, we think that the conversion and growth to Internet-enabled entertainment is intact and people
are loving it. People are adopting Netflix around the world increasingly more in our newer markets as well. And so I think we're still on track for a
strong growth year this year, and maybe it's going to come in a little bit differently than we expected and others expected.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
And Todd, you know this probably that paid net adds are up compared to year ago and forecast to be up a year-on-year over basis in Q3. And the
fundamentals have never been stronger. Our viewing is setting year-over-year records, the shows that we have coming. So we're feeling very strong
about the business.

JULY 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q2 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Video Interview
Client Id: 77
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Terrific. I'll stay on this for just a couple more follow-ups and then we'll move on to broader things. Just wonder, over the course of the winter, there
were some well-publicized essentially global pricing increases. I wonder if you think that had any impact on either retention or gross adds relative
to your forecast.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Oh, we don't think so, Todd. I mean, if anything, we -- all of 2017, we sort of had rolling increases in various different parts of the world. We were
able to grow continually through that and we continue to. So I don't think that is contributing to this trend.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
And Todd, we've seen this movie of Q2 shortfall before about 2 years ago in 2016, and we never did find the explanation of that other than there's
some lumpiness in the business and continue to perform after that.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Great. Let me hit on Q3 really fast or else I wouldn't be doing my job. So you are kind enough always to give us a forecast for that, and it just stood
out to me that I think it's slightly below net adds from a year ago. I only had a quick chance. So I think that's -- I don't know if that's on paid or total
or both.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
It's on total, Todd. So as Reed pointed out, paid net adds are actually up year-on-year. But again, we try not to focus too narrowly on like a couple
hundred thousand, right, or on any one particular quarter. If you kind of look at Q2 and Q3, it's essentially kind of flat with last year. And last year,
we had sort of 5 million -- about 5 million global net adds in Q1; 5 million, Q2; 5 million, Q3; and then 8 million in Q4. Years prior, we've always had
very strong growth in sort of Q1 and Q4 relative to Q2, Q3, and we think that pattern is going to happen again this year. And so again, we tend to
focus on 12-month rolling over 12-month rolling not only in a particular quarter because as Reed points out, we've seen this movie before and
we've been through these cycles of growth. And we think the sort of background fact of people adopting Internet entertainment, including
increasingly more international adoption, is going to drive really strong year-on-year growth in international with U.S. hanging out in that 4 million
to 5 million net additions band that it has been for the last 4 or 5 years.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
All right. One final sort of segue on to bigger things. So has the results or any learnings from this quarter caused you guys to change at all your
internal forecast longer term for either sub growth or revenue growth or free cash flow?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
No, but as Reed indicated -- it's David. I'll take it again and others can chime in. But the business fundamentals, the on track for 10% operating
margin we indicated, we do have some foreign exchange headwinds that kind of pushed us towards the bottom end of that range. But everything
else is sort of tracking according to our target and plan. And so again, we feel pretty good about it. I mean, obviously when you have sort of the 1
million net adds, we aren't going to manage within the band of marketing spend and other things to protect that operating margin growth long
-- in the short term. But long term, nothing's really changed.

JULY 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q2 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Video Interview
Client Id: 77
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
All right. Don't worry, Greg and Ted, I've got plenty for you. But moving to the other elephant that was already in the room, just checking a bit on
the competitive landscape. Obviously, a lot going on between Disney and Comcast and Fox and Sky. So need to check in and hear what you're
thinking in terms of what impact on Netflix, however that result turns out, and is any particular result better or worse for your own competitive
fortunes?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Yes, there's a lot of new and strengthening competition with Disney entering the market, HBO getting additional funding, the different French
broadcasters coming together. So that's all normal and expected. So it is what it is. We're not going to be able to change it. And then our focus is
on doing the best content we've ever done, having the best user interface, the best recommendations, the best marketing, all the things that we've
been doing for many years in the past and we'll keep doing for many years in the future.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
And the other thing I would add to that, Todd, is the market for entertainment is so big that there can be multiple firms that are successful. So
you've heard us talk in the past about how we've been able to grow dramatically in the U.S., and HBO and other networks have also similarly been
able to grow at the same time. So it's a very large market.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
In our programming, we've always been focused on keeping people entertained and satisfied on an absolute basis, not relative to any consumer.
So we're just trying to -- or any competitor. So really by keeping an eye on our members and our consumers, we're better served than hyper focusing
on competition.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
So one of the most frequent sort of investor questions related to this topic is access to content, licensed content, particularly from Disney and Fox.
Let me start with this very specific one. There is a wide, wide variance in degree of opinion on how much content on Netflix comes from off-network
licensing Disney and Fox content. Care to narrow that down for investors? Anything you can give us, some sense of just both from an availability
perspective and maybe from a viewership perspective how much is there?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
No, I don't want to narrow it down any more than this, but I would tell you that it's been a number that's been on the decline for several years. You
should think about it the way we look at this long term is that our competitors will want that content on their own services. That was a bet we'd
made a long time ago when we got into original programming. And every year since that, we've been doing less and less off-net business with
Disney and Fox. And our bet is that is long term, that they'll want all of their content on their service. In the short to medium term, we're still licensing
content off net from them, and they're also producing original content for us, like Nurse Ratched from Fox or the Marvel series from Disney.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Right. I know you've answered this quarter -- this question, Ted, I think the last 2 or 3 quarters consecutively, but I got to ask it again. Any reason
to expect that those types of sort of original shows that you get from Disney and Fox to change given the new information from what they're
doing?

JULY 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q2 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Video Interview
Client Id: 77
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
No, those shows are for us to cancel. So -- but we're -- and we're super happy with the performance of them so far. So -- and the Nurse Ratched and
Fox -- some other Fox original titles are still upcoming.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
So speaking of your own originals, yes, I wanted to touch on a couple of sort of relatively newer areas of focus for you and just check in to see how's
it going. So one is unscripted, right? It seems -- and you talked about this last quarter. It's been a sort of recent elevated higher priority for you guys.
How's that going? What's your experience been? Is it being enjoyed by your members as much as you thought?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes, and we're super excited about the variety of the shows and how they're landing with consumers. Similarly, we thought a long time ago that
the unscripted networks are also going to want to keep their own content for their own services, and we started investing our own unscripted
programming and have had some really great out-of-the-box hits with Nailed It and Fastest Cars and Queer Eye that are doing great with our
watchers relative to building an audience. And also, you saw Queer Eye did quite well at the Emmys, the nominations announced last week. So
we're really excited about the progress and the speed to market we've been able to do our unscripted shows at really high quality.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
On the original movie side, another not-quite-so-new area of focus but still more recent, what's your assessment of your progress versus where
you'd hope to be on that front?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
We're moving as quick as we can with -- and still delivering movies that people want to watch. So you saw in the letter, we talked a little bit about
the results of our romantic comedy, Kissing Booth. There was much made in the press this summer about our romantic comedies have all been
pretty successful, Set It Up just prior -- just after The Kissing Booth. And so these are movies that are not really being made in the market much,
and we're doing -- moving into those. But we're also doing a lot of the big event films with A-list directors, and these are long lead production
times. And we're really excited with the way they've been delivering in terms of viewership, and we think that we'll see similar trends that we saw
in television, but it will take another year or so as we get into it.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
One final one I wanted to check in on, which will allow us to move forward here, was, what I'll call, non-English language, for better -- for lack of a
better word. It seems like you're making more stuff in other places of the world. It seems like that's having success all around the globe. I wonder
if you could confirm that and talk about your own assessment of the returns you're getting on those sorts of program investments.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes, similarly, fast ramp-up and early success. So we've been producing shows that are incredibly relevant in their home territories, and the nice
windfall is, is they get viewed all over the world. So we saw that recently with Rain and Dark. We certainly, in India, we saw great success recently
with Sacred Games that really people -- really excite the market. And these are places where our global [results] play well, too. So it's really, I think,
accelerating the brand perception of Netflix as not just an out-of-towner, but someone who's producing content that you care about in every part
of the world. Upcoming this year, we have new seasons of Las Chicas del Cable from Spain, Ingobernable from Mexico. We have a new show from

Spain called Elite coming out next -- in Q3, Ghoul in India coming out in August. And these are shows that are produced at a level that are really
high that consumers get really excited about and it helps them get really excited about Netflix if they're not quite sure who we are yet.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Great. So now that we've moved on outside of U.S., English Western world, can I check in just a little bit specifically on Asia and carve out India for
a second, because I'm going to come to India specifically later. But just to Asia as a huge reason generally, I think we've talked in the past how the
content tastes there are a little different. The business model, you were hoping to find the exact right formula. How is your growth going in Asia
generally? What is driving it? Is it at a similar pace, at the same stage to other markets in the world? Any deeper info you can give us on that part
of the world, anybody?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Reed, why don't you take it?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Sure. I'd say, Todd, we're starting to turn the corner in many of the nations where our viewing is climbing up as we're continuing to improve the
programming. And when we get high viewing in every other market, that has brought in an era of fast growth. And so we've seen that. It's [very]
country by country. I'll include India in the description and say we're really pleased with the progress and tracking we're making since we launched
2.5 years ago, and we just have a lot of work and a lot of opportunity ahead.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
And Todd, the only annotation I would say is, look, it's still early. We launched with a very sort of a stem model approach and we've augmented
that, right? We're adding payment methods. We're adding more content. We are working on all of the playbook that has been successful for us in
other markets of the world, and you see that through increased investment. And so that sort of last wave of expansion for Netflix is still relatively
early, and that's affecting our growth numbers. It's affecting our levels of investment as well where other markets are sort of growing in profit. Now
that actually -- those markets collectively are growing a loss, and we have more growth in the profitable markets than we do in the loss markets
and that's what's growing the overall margin.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
And we've been really thrilled with our original production of anime that's being viewed quite pan-regionally throughout Asia and of course, in
Japan. Our scripted series and our unscripted series, like Busted! from Korea or Terrace House from Japan, are viewed throughout the region, which
are -- and are building brands bigger and bigger.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
And so thank you for sort of carving out India separately, only because for a number of reasons, right, it's such a place with huge potential. I think
numerous executives have been quoted into various places recently talking about the potential there. You've got some new original shows there.
So specifically in India, if you could dive a little deeper into where you are on the growth curve there, how you see the path to success and how
big that could be for you in the next many years.

JULY 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q2 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Video Interview
Client Id: 77
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Well, Todd, we're way behind YouTube, Hotstar. Those are really the leaders on the Internet, and there's so much TV viewing that linear TV that
could be Internet viewing. And the advantages are tremendous in India for Internet viewing because you don't get the ad load that you see that's
so high in all of the other platforms. So Netflix is having great success getting established, getting a reputation going. And with this triplet of Lust
Stories, Sacred Games and Ghoul, we're really getting some nice momentum in our India growth. Now it's still -- we're still, as David said, a niche
product. We've got a long way to go to expand languages and many other aspects to be able to cover -- be a broad Indian product. But in terms
of our beachhead, I'm very pleased with what we've been doing.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Greg, there seems like there's some maybe seemingly obvious particulars about the Indian market from a product perspective that might be
peculiar. How much of that is just from the infrastructure that exists and the affordability in the marketplace? Is that true? And if so, what have you
got up your sleeve to try and make Netflix easy for everybody in India to enjoy?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
There are definitely a few specific things that we're doing there to get to payments and how sign-up has to happen. We just rolled out some
improvements on the sign-up flow on TVs. So we made that easier for nonmembers to become members in that dimension. But actually, a lot of
the work that we do that helps our members in India is actually applicable in some sense globally as well, whether that's more efficient encodes
to make the viewing process higher quality, start faster. That obviously is great for our members in India, but it's great for members around the
world. Downloads is another great example where we rolled out downloads for when you don't have great connectivity or you don't want to use
the data in your data cap. Now we've just actually rolled out the next iteration of that smart download so we can make that process even more fun
and easy by having episodes you watched automatically deleted and get replaced by new episodes whenever you come back on a WiFi network.
So it's a mix of both India-specific and just globally relevant.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Yes. In there, you talked about payments and just that whole stream. It's a question that comes up a lot with me with investors is just a thought
about the affordability of the product relative to relative incomes. That comes up a lot in India. I'm going to broaden the question to just various
places in the emerging world. How much room do you guys feel you have there in India and other places? Are you -- do you sense you're reaching
a limit of any sense in terms of the utility of the product compared to alternatives and customers' ability to pay that would affect retail ARPUs any
time over the near horizon?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
I would say we're far from reaching a limit in terms of the addressable market given the pricing structures we have right now. We got a lot of room
to grow in a reasonably affluent part of the society in India and other markets around the world, so much more runway. But having said that, we're
constantly testing our pricing models, what pricing strategies work best for our members around the world and trying to find what features, what
tiers we can add to make that both a revenue positive but also a consumer-friendly and consumer-fair kind of approach.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
And Todd, just to build off of that a little bit, I mean, we're talking about India a little bit as homogenous. But breaking this apart, Reed has mentioned
it, Greg has mentioned it, we may have an issue where there's 3 or 4 different sort of growth patterns within India in terms of different demographics,
different segmented groups as we address one segment and then we start addressing another and so forth and so forth. And each one has a specific

set of challenges with it, and we're in the early days of sort of that first segment. So expect more from us in terms of getting into segments 2, 3 and
4.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
And I do think that the price point is mostly relevant to the value proposition, our Indian consumers finding a lot to watch on Netflix, having a great
time doing it. And if they are, that price point becomes more of a value proposition than a premium proposition.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Yes, just picking up on that, one statistic that you guys sometimes mention and sometimes don't, I don't think I saw it in the press release, was the
notion of engagement as one good, perhaps, indicator of value received by your members. Any comments on where engagement, I guess defined
as hours streamed, hours streamed per member, sort of stood this quarter? Is this still growing in line with content growth? Any...
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
It is indeed still growing, Todd, on a year-over-year basis. Our viewing hours -- we mostly measure it by median view hours -- is growing. So we're
super excited about that. And we're still a small fraction of every society's overall viewing, so I think there's still room to grow there.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Got it. One more on pricing just because I know you're always testing. We all know that. But one of your tests got picked up in the press. We actually
stumbled across it, this idea of an Ultra plan. It seems to be a test for HDR viewing that you're experimenting with. Just any thoughts you want to
share on the theory behind that and the marketplace acceptance you think might exist for that type of a plan?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
I'd say more generally rather than speaking specifically to any results because that's still very much in progress. We are -- we want to test at both
ends of the spectrum here and try and figure out ways to add more value for those members who might see that as being good value while we're
testing its more accessibility, how we create a way to access Netflix for a broader group of people. But a test that's still in progress and no results
to discuss at this point.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Fair enough. So another way that you've been going to market increasingly, it seems, is with these partner deals. Maybe there's a better internal
word for them, and they were mentioned again in the press -- in the shareholder letter. I'd love to check in on a couple things on that. So first of
all, is anybody willing to tell us roughly how important these are to your net add growth, to your overall subscriber base? Any sense of proportionality
there other than what you said in the letter, which is basically a supplemental channel but the majority are still direct?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
No, I just -- I think I'd reiterate that, that the vast majority of our acquisitions still comes by consumers signing up directly with us. We're fairly new
when it comes to these partner bundles. We're excited and optimistic about it. So I think that, that will grow as a percentage of our acquisition.
And what we're really excited about it is it actually allows us to sort of more efficiently address different consumer segments. Let's take the U.S. for
example, a market we've been relatively well penetrated in. By doing a deal like with Comcast, it allows us to put the application on the set-top
box where consumers that might be less early adopters or more late adopters are already watching traditional television. By being included in a

bundle, we get to remove a separate purchase decision, we get to eliminate the sign-up flow, which makes it super simple and easy for consumers
to sign up via that mechanism.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
And Todd, just to be consistent with what we've said in prior quarters, it is a growing element of our acquisition, right? As we -- as Greg said, as we
penetrate into demographics and established markets that may not be on the early part of that S-curve of adoption and also our newer emerging
markets where partnerships may allow us to do things like partner billing and tap into consumer trust, it's a little bit earlier in the cycle than if we
establish that ourselves.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Is there any feedback you're in a position to share from the partners themselves in terms of how these programs are working for them, not to single
-- T-Mobile comes to mind just because they've been at it in the States the longest, but anyplace in the world you characterize their feedback to
you?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Yes, I think it's something that's very important to us because obviously we want a sustainable model around this where it's adding -- it's valuable
to the partners, perceived as valuable by them in supporting their business so that they want to continue to invest in it and expand it. And market
by market, it's different. But it's either a differentiation strategy where our partner is seeking a position themselves slightly differently. But oftentimes
it's just actually a way of them communicating to the consumer the value that they're investing in their network or the quality of service and like
that. And having Netflix, an amazing content that we have, and having a really high-quality experience with that is a great way of just telling that
story to their customers and their customers to be.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
It creates a great narrative that it's -- they're a good video source because when you're talking about Netflix, it becomes the symbol of a great data
system, right?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Especially when you think about the -- we're trying to be super innovative on the video quality and audio quality, all those things that you unlock
by having a great network and a great service.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
And just to add on, Todd, we've been doing partnerships with other partners for many, many years, and we've had many -- multiyear relationships
with many of our different partners. So as Greg said, we want this to be sustainable. And because we've had these for many years, I think you can
extrapolate from that, that they're successful for both parties.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
And Todd, it's not a radical thing, MVPDs bundling another network. That's pretty well-trodden territory on their side.

One of the things that these partnerships give to you is also some more -- some marketing investment that were just done on your behalf by them.
Coming into the year, one of the themes that seems to -- that I interpreted from you guys was a little bit relative increase in the emphasis of your
own marketing investment behind your content and your service. Just checking in that, so -- and I guess we've seen that in the financials, too, so
just how is that going? Are you seeing the returns that you hoped for? And any specifics? Can you maybe help give us some examples of specific
types of marketing programs and how you measure your investment of that where you're spending these incremental dollars?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
A couple -- we're very pleased with the growth and our ability to invest. A lot of it is behind title brands and seeing how do we help title brands
really maximize their potential within the overall system. We're doing lots of tests, trying different methods in different countries, learning what's
the most efficient ways to build demand for a title. So there's tremendous amounts of learning going on there. And then we're also doing acquisition
marketing and learning on that side. David, did you want to add to that?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
No, I think that's great. Just to remind Todd, it's been a while. We've been out of the sort of we spend this much on marketing, we grow this much
directly in a quarter. We only have fraction of our spend is oriented around direct acquisition. What Reed is saying is like the majority of the marketing
spend, call it, 80%, 85% is oriented around building title brands. And we've got good evidence that we can do that. We're just parsing through
what the most efficient mechanism is to market those titles and also where the right amount of spend is as well as we grow our content library.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
And what we see a lot is that the channels themselves vary by -- around the content itself, too. So learning more about how to get more and more
refined about which channels for which content get the best results is the things that we're learning right now.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
And Ted, were you pleased with the Emmy nomination campaigns?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
I was thrilled. I was thrilled we had -- we took the record obviously. The most -- but the thing I was most proud of is we had 40 different shows
nominated and kind of give you an idea of the kind of different variety of things that we're doing: scripted, unscripted, comedy, drama, talk shows,
everything across the board. Everyone was represented. It was 40 shows we're --they were very happy people last week and millions of fans around
the world, too. So...
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Well, here comes the world's most inelegant segue, but being respectful to your shareholders, the single most popular question I got in prep for
this. So I'm going to share it with you out of duty to that, I'm sorry, was revolving net neutrality. And so I guess we have a new administration
relatively or not that new, but between that and some other...

Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Around the world, net neutrality has won as a consumer expectation. And some countries have net neutrality laws, other countries don't. But
broadly around the world, consumers have the expectation and ISPs are delivering it. So I would say the net neutrality advocates have won the
day in terms of those expectations. So we don't see any changes to that in the U.S. or other countries. So it's quite a positive outcome for changing
cultural expectations in a positive way.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Flipping back inelegantly to my more core line of questioning. And speaking of big investments, Ted, I didn't give you a chance yet to --
you've got some big new partners in terms of producers on overall deals that caught the attention of investors obviously, your Ryan Murphys and
your Shonda Rhimes and your Jenji Kohans, not to leave out anybody. Help us think through...
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Jason Bateman most recently.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Can you help us think through, are there more of those to come, a? That's one question, and more deals like that, more people like that. And sort
of secondly related, what's the time line? When -- has development started from any of these resources? And how long before we see the output
of their work on -- show up -- starts to show up on Netflix?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, it's a great question, and they are -- you should think about, it's a pretty rare creator who has an ownable sensibility, who produces a lot of
content prolific and successful, people like Shonda and Ryan and Jenji and Jason, they have a brand and they care about the brand and they want
to create in that brand and they want to be -- and they want to create a lot. So we could give them an infrastructure to do that in Netflix because
we have a great history of finding and connecting an audience for all those different shows. So there's -- that's not true of all creators, but it has
been with the shows that we're doing so far, and we're looking -- and we will probably do more, but it is a pretty rare breed of creator. And then
we just physically moved Shonda into her new home here at Netflix and we're thrilled. She has a couple of shows percolating now that we can't
announce yet, but we're really thrilled with the direction she's going. Ryan's finishing up his work at Fox, and then he'll be full steam ahead.
Remember, his last 2 shows at Fox are going to be our first 2 shows actually with The Politician and Nurse Ratched. So we're -- we've been -- we're
in the Ryan Murphy business in a big way. And then Jenji going from Weeds to Orange is the New Black to GLOW was exactly what I'm talking
about, about being prolific and successful. So we're really thrilled.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Right. Moving, David, to your very specific world and a popular question obviously. So -- and you answer this every quarter, just regarding your
continued use of debt to finance your current free cash flow deficits, especially in an era of rising rate or recurring environment of rising rates. Just
need to check in and make sure we understand your logic and your continued ability or plan to finance the company and the future deficits for
the next few [days].

David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
I mean, we continue to see debt as the most optimal choice, the most cost-effective use of capital -- or sorry, source of capital for the company.
Obviously, we love to get to that point where we're organically and self-funding content, and we do see a point where we can get there. But until
we do, we see debt as the right choice in terms of cost of capital.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
And another popular question, and I'm getting through as many as I can before Spencer tells me time is up. So here's another one and probably
for either Ted or Reed, you guys get this a lot. Investors still want to know your desire or appetite for sports type of content rights, for news-oriented
type of content rights or for other expansions of your platform to either get into audio or gaming or selling other people's products, any of those
sorts of new genres or potential expansion theories. Where are you on those?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
No change in our long-term views that have been, as you referred to, expressed over and over. We have such an opportunity in movies and TV
shows of many types around the world that it's consuming every bit of energy and excitement that we have.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Got it. Let me, if I can, move to what I think might be sort of the seminal question, 2 questions, for long-term Netflix shareholders, which is really,
hey, you got about 130 million global members now. How long is it going to take you to get the next 130 million? And if you double your members,
are you going to need to double your spend in content and marketing to attract and retain them?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Well, it's kind of hypothetical to think about the P&L structure. We'll learn as we go. We've been very attentive to all the key factors, which is we
want to invest enough on content to make our subscribers incredibly happy because that's how we grow. So it's a really smart investment for us
on the content side. We want to invest in product and marketing to make the whole service better, to make the shows be more aware. We also
want to steadily increase operating margin over the next several years. And so as an example, we've got some adjustments to make because of
foreign exchange rates, and we'll make those adjustments and we'll grow into that. So think of us as continuing every year to figure out how we
make certain adjustments to keep the operating margins growing, the subscriber base and revenue growing. And that's been the basic way we've
been operating over the last several years. So it's more of the same. And in terms of the dartboard, as you know, several years out on when we
double, the answer is not soon enough. We're always pushing hard to figure out how can we get even more growth, but we're awfully pleased
with what we've got to.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Todd, I think we have time for one more question.
Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
All right. So I guess I'll use that to sort of just expound on the big dartboard I just asked and maybe start with Greg and then anyone else who wants
to comment. When you think about the product itself, which is the underpinning of the belief you have in the growth, what's on your short-term
and long-term list of things that you think your members most desire would move the needle most from a product perspective, from a content
perspective, from an overall pricing and value perspective and therefore drives your agenda, I guess each of you, over the rest of this year and into
the coming decade?

Client Id: 77
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
It's a long, long list, and we want to make really almost everything better about the product. I'll just sort of highlight one that's fun and happening
right now. We talked about the improvements in the mobile UI and Smart Downloads, but I don't want to leave out TV. And with all of these amazing
content that we are bringing out, we've been working really hard over the last several months and quarters even, testing and researching how do
we make that TV experience faster, more fun, easier to find the stories that our members will love. And we're actually going to roll some improvements
out to that experience and make that better starting tomorrow. So starting this week, you'll see those, and that's -- we expect to be a long line of
incremental improvements that make that experience even greater for finding the stories that you love.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
I'd say in the short term, and we've got -- I've got the great pleasure of trying to make people very happy. And in the short term, we've got new
seasons coming up the second half of this year of Orange is the New Black, Ozark, Iron Fist, Daredevil, Narcos, the finale of House of Cards, the
follow-up series for Making a Murderer. And we have some brand-new IP coming up with new shows like Insatiable; Maniac with Emma Stone and
Jonah Hill; Disenchantment from Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, doing an animated comedy for us; a new show from Greg Berlanti's
company, the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, a spinoff of Riverdale, has been hugely popular for us. And that all ramps up to bigger and better
feature films, too, for our fans around the world, starting with [Christmas Chronicles] from Chris Columbus later this year and Bird Box from Sandra
Bullock with the great Susanne Bier directing. That will lead us into next year. We have movies from Martin Scorsese and Alfonso Cuarón and all
these fantastic directors, and the opportunities are just limitless.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
And then for me, and I'll let Reed have the honor of going -- wrapping us up, but I would say we've got 130 million members and the prospect of
adding whatever that is, 100 million more, the next 130 million, all of those folks enjoy connectedness. And as we grow to enjoy more stories that
are sourced from wherever in the world, I think the ability for all those folks, or a great portion of those folks, to enjoy and see the story and discuss
that story in the same moment is great. And Netflix, being an enabler of that, will continue to do that, and I look forward to the 8 billion of content
growing from here. We think we can grow operating margin, but we're also going to grow content spend, which will enable more of that content.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
And Todd, for me, it's about connecting the world and sharing the stories all around the world. I think we've got so much more we can do with
that as we learn the various arts of dubbing and style, and I think that will make really profound contribution to the world in addition to just
entertaining everyone, which is very joyful to work on.
With that, let me thank everyone for participating in the call and look forward to spending time with you guys, investors, over the quarter. Thank
you very much.

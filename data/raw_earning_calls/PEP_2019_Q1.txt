could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted. Statements made on this conference call should be considered together
with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
When discussing our financial results on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from our reported
results. Such items include the impacts of certain tax-related matters, foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other
changes and restructuring charges. You should refer to the glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings release and to the Investors
section of PepsiCo's website under the Earnings Information tab to find full explanations and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.
And now it's my pleasure to introduce Ramon Laguarta.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. About 2 months ago, we shared with you in some detail our priorities for the business and our financial
goals for 2019. So today, we're keeping our prepared comments short, just touching on the highlights for the quarter, and then we will leave
enough time to get to all your questions.
I'll just start by simply saying that we're very pleased with our results for the very -- for the first quarter. Our rate of organic revenue growth accelerated
to 5.2%, our highest rate of quarterly growth in more than 3 years. This top line performance was broad-based with particularly strong organic
revenue growth at Frito-Lay North America, which grew 6%, and our international divisions, while negatively affected on reported basis by ForEx
and refranchising, delivered organic revenue growth of 8% in ESSA and 10% in both Latin America and AMENA.
We also had solid growth and continued progress at PepsiCo Beverages North America where organic revenue was up 2% -- 2.5% in the quarter.
We invested, as planned, across our businesses, and this include a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing. And our productivity and
restructuring actions were all implemented according to plan.
Our strong performance in the quarter is emblematic of a number of key strengths in the business, amongst them: the health and resilience of our
categories; our leading brands; our broad-based portfolio capable of evolving to satisfy consumer tastes; our developed geographic footprint with
strong positions in our largest markets; suite of strong and relevant capabilities across the value chain; scale that allow us to run our operations
very efficiently; and of course, our highly engaged and motivated associates, who execute every day in a way that enables us to win in the marketplace.
So with strong start to the year and 1 quarter under our belt, we remain confident in achieving the 2019 financial goals we shared with you 2
months ago.
Looking ahead, we're staying focused on the priorities we shared with you in February namely: to accelerate our top line growth in a sustainable
way, to compete more effectively to win in most of our markets and more rapidly evolve our capabilities to widen our advantages versus the
competition. To achieve these objectives, we're focused on becoming faster, stronger and better. We'll become faster by being more consumer-centric
and accelerating investment for top line growth and winning in the marketplace. This means broadening our portfolio and packaging formats to
win locally, fortifying our North American businesses by investing in Frito-Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America, and accelerating
our international expansion with a disciplined focus on right-to-win markets.
We'll become stronger by transforming our capabilities and our culture. This means driving savings through holistic cost management to invest
in the marketplace, developing and scaling the core capabilities necessary to better understand and meet new consumer trends, strengthen our
brands and improve customer service, and building a differentiated organization, talent base and culture.
And finally, we'll become better by integrating our purpose agenda into our business strategy with a particular focus on 4 critical initiatives: first,
advancing farming practices to optimize crop yields, protect human rights, improve farmer livelihoods and secure supply; second, replenishing
more water than we use in water-stressed areas; third, creating a circular economy for plastics; and fourth, increasing the appeal of our products
by reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fats and adding more positive ingredients. The entire organization from the Board to our frontline
is moving forward with urgency, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses.

APRIL 17, 2019 / 11:45AM, PEP - Q1 2019 PepsiCo Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
And now let me hand you off to Hugh.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Great. Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. I have just a few comments on the balance of year outlook. As we mentioned in the release,
we are reiterating each of the components of our 2019 guidance namely: we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 4%, a core effective
tax rate of approximately 21%, core constant currency EPS to decline approximately 1%, free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, and total cash
returned to shareholders of approximately $8 billion comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately
$3 billion.
With both organic revenue growth and core constant currency EPS growth higher in Q1 than in our full year targets, that implies the growth rate
for the balance of the year will be below the Q1 growth rates. So let me address how you should think about that starting with the top line.
First, the rate of organic revenue growth at FLNA in Q1 was extraordinary. We don't expect that rate of growth to continue for the balance of the
year. And second, Q1 represented our easiest lap of the year so balance of year laps will be more difficult especially in the back half of the year.
From an EPS perspective, you should consider the following: One, in Q1, we had the benefit of lapping the onetime frontline bonus from 2018, and
we also benefited from approximately $50 million of insurance recoveries in the current year. Two, over the balance of the year, we will be lapping
gains from various strategic asset sales and refranchising gains and insurance recoveries, most notably in Q2. Three, our rate of net commodity
inflation, which includes the impact of transactional foreign exchange, is expected to accelerate in the second quarter. And finally, our pace of
planned reinvestments will accelerate over the course of the year, and you will see this reflected both in core EPS as well as in our operating margin
performance.
Now we'll open it up for your questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
The -- I was curious if you could talk a little bit about gross margins, obviously, really solid in the quarter kind of as expected. But I was curious
about: one, in the near term, kind of next year let's call it, thinking about commodity inflation environment somewhat, how you might expect that
to progress? And then also longer term, as mix in the portfolio evolves, I guess category mix within beverages, price tiering, some of the things
you've talked about in emerging markets, how should we think about gross margins from a longer-term perspective?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Happy to, Lauren, too. A couple of things. One, obviously, we don't give gross margin guidance, so I'll talk more conceptually than I will
specifically to numbers. We were obviously pleased with gross margins in the first quarter, but as I just mentioned, we do expect to see more
commodity inflation in the balance of the year, and transactional ForEx will pressure commodities as well. So I think in the first quarter, we saw
probably, I call it, very strong gross margin performance. In the balance of the year, we'll see how it plays out based on how FX and commodities
play out. Longer term, obviously, we're looking to increase gross margins over time, and that's driven primary by productivity in the cost of goods
area.

Client Id: 77
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Lauren, there's 3 capabilities we're working on to make sure we protect our gross margins long term, expand it. One is net revenue management,
key capability. The other one is innovation. And the other one is holistic cost management. So those 3 capabilities are the ones where we'll invest
in and develop in the team to make sure that we protect gross margin long term.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
Judy Eunjoo Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD, Senior Analyst & Co-Head of the GIR Asian Professionals Network
So obviously, a pretty strong quarter from an organic revenue growth perspective, particularly as you called out some of the international markets
in ESSA and AMENA. Maybe you could give us a little bit more color just in terms of what you've seen in category versus your market share in some
of your key markets. And Hugh, you commented on sort of the strength in ESSA not repeating in the back half of the year. So maybe a little bit
more color just why you don't think that, that will be sustainable in the balance of the year.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Judy, this is Ramon. Yes, we're very pleased with the growth in international. And really, the macros have been very, very positive, I would say,
during the quarter. We haven't seen any major geopolitical or big devaluation in any of our markets.
So with your comments on ESSA, we've been investing in ESSA for many years now in building sustainable marketplace performance, and that's
coming across. Most of our markets are gaining share, both in beverages and snacks. Turkey has been the only country where we're seeing some
ForEx disruption, and the team is doing a great job going through that. The same in AMENA. We had a great Chinese New Year, very, very strong
Chinese New Year. The team prepared very well, and we're getting better at capturing that big seasonal opportunity there in that large market. So
we're seeing very positive.
Same with Mexico. Mexico has had a great quarter, gaining share consistently already for 3 quarters and continues to be a very solid performing
business. So we're seeing good macros and good performance across most of our operations.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. And Judy, just to clarify, the only thing I'd add about the laps, my comment about the laps being tougher in the back half of the year are about
the company laps, not just specifically about ESSA.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
So I guess my question, Ramon, it's -- I know it's early in the year, but you've now have the ability to begin to kind of measure or assess the efficacy
of the step-up in marketing and advertising, especially in PBNA. So I guess can you give us some color on whether you think it's: a, it's going to be
enough; and b, you're beginning to see the consumer response, the lift from the investments that you're making.

Client Id: 77
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Bryan, yes, of course. Listen, it's the third quarter of growth in NAB, so we feel good about the progress we're making in NAB. We feel good about
a couple of areas. First, I think we're really strengthening the brands. We feel very good about how Pepsi is performing, so yes, the investment in
Pepsi and some of the portfolio innovation and especially packaging innovation is working very well in Pepsi. We're seeing an improvement in
Gatorade. The velocity of Gatorade is improving as well. I think we have some more work to do in Dew, and we will be investing more in Dew during
the year. So we feel good about that part of our investments.
I think what we feel really good is about our innovation. Innovation is really working very well in North America beverages. So if you think about
LIFEWTR, third year of growth, doubling velocities as we increase distribution. Still, the velocity is going very fast. We're feeling very good about
Game Fuel, some of the innovation we have in the energy area. Gatorade Zero is going to be a big incremental opportunity for us. It's driving
category growth, and it's driving share for Gatorade. So we feel good about our innovation and some of our brand investments.
The areas where we are still working on is executional excellence, and we made the new division structure. That's going to help us a lot in terms
of becoming a much more stronger local operator whilst keeping a very good customer service to our large national customers. So we'll keep
investing in that area, but we feel good about the velocity of the brands, as I mentioned, the innovation. And we'll get better execution as we invest
and take maximum benefit from the new organization.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - SVP and Senior Analyst
So I actually have 2 questions. One is just a clarification on the onetimers. Because as we add them up -- I understand last year about the insurance
recoveries and everything else, it seems like there's about $100 million swing from last year to this year in these onetimers or about $0.05 a share.
I just want to make sure we're kind of getting to roughly the right number, as you guys think about it. And that's probably for Hugh.
And then the broader question is about the ROI and the nature of reinvestments, not because 5% organic sales growth isn't good. I mean, we
thought you'd ran it up to 5%. You ran it down to 5%, so that's all great. But is really North America driven more by price/mix versus volume? So
trying to understand the nature of your investments. We would expect a little bit more, I guess, volume-driven or demand-building type investments
given the plan that you laid out before for marketing, et cetera. So those 2 questions would be really helpful, please.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, I'll answer -- I'll take the question around onetimers. Depending on what you characterize as onetime, I think that's about right, $100 million
swing. In addition to that, obviously, the tax rate was higher in the quarter this year. But I think $100 million swing is about right.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. And on the investment, Ali, I think it's still premature to get any good readings on the return on investment. However, we've seen, as I said,
velocity of the brands improving. We're seeing market share recovery in a lot of the segments. We're seeing the brand equity better. We're seeing
some of our numerical distribution and customer service KPIs improving. So we feel good about how our investments are turning into positive
operating numbers. And we feel good about the progress we're making.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.
Andrea Faria Teixeira - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
So I wanted to just follow-up on FLNA. And volumes continue to be strong on material stack and running about 3% in pricing the same way. I was
just wondering if you can give us comfort that you're seeing good quality on that growth? And I think you called out in the Q on the big franchises
still running at a very high pace. So if you can comment on how you see the progress into the goal of this 5%? And how sustainable you see it going
forward?
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. The category in savories is performing very, very well in the U.S., and I think it's a combination of our investments. Obviously, we have a big
share of this category and some other players investing. We are obviously having a very good partnership with our customers, building -- increasing
the space of this category in the stores. So it's a compounded impact of multiple factors that is driving the category. Within this category, Frito-Lay
is improving its share performance as well, so we're seeing the double impact of that.
The -- you were referring to pricing. We're getting better at net revenue management and how we're capturing the maximum pricing of every
occasion. So I think Frito has done a great job of managing their mix to obviously maximize revenue of the demand that there is in the market. And
then they've made some operational adjustments to some of the supply chain bottlenecks that we had in the past. And we've been able to capture
some of the seasonal opportunities, especially around Super Bowl in, I would say, in a very, very impactful way together with our beverages business
as well. So we had a very good Super Bowl.
So you put it all together and the category is healthy. I think this category will continue to have strong tailwinds as consumers -- we've talked this
in the past, consumers go into more on unstructured meals during the day. So we have -- I think we tailwinds. Plus our investments, I think, are
accelerating the performance of this category. So we feel good about Frito. Obviously, also, we're working on productivity and make sure that the
business continues to generate the efficiencies to reinvest, make sure that this model is sustainable long term.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
Bonnie Lee Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Beverage & Tobacco Analyst
I wanted to ask about CSDs. There's a fairly wide delta remaining between your share performance and that of your largest branded competitor,
especially in the U.S. So could you guys update us on some of your initiatives in CSDs, specifically innovation which you didn't mention any plans
that I heard? And then how successful has your stepped-up spending been in that category specifically? And then finally, I guess, I'd like to understand
how big of a priority CSDs are relative to your other beverage categories in term of the investment spend and allocation of resources?
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Okay. Good. So listen, of course, CSD is a very critical category for us, and we talked about that. And we need to have a balance growth between
CSDs and NCBs if we really want to make progress in this business. So from that point of view, it's clear that we're treating both segments of the
market with a very clear intention of allocation of resources, with CSDs taking a very important role for us.

Within CSDs, our first priority was Pepsi. And we started investing in Pepsi last year. The good news is that the Pepsi brand is gaining share of CSDs
already so -- and pretty good growth compared to our cola competitor. So we feel good about that large segment of CSDs.
Now as I said before, we're working on Dew. Dew is also improving its performance in its core portfolio, and we have some laps that are over as of
March, so you will see an improvement in CSD share. We continue to invest against Dew. You'll see -- I already mentioned the innovation. There is
innovation on Dew brand. Game Fuel is one of the innovations in Dew brand. We have other innovations coming up in this summer that you guys
will be able to see in the marketplace, and you'll see some very strong activations of the brand coming up in the summer.
So we feel good about Pepsi, and it's a combination of brand, it's the combination of non-sugar doing very well, mini cans doing very well. So the
portfolio transformation we've made as well is helping us to -- for Pepsi to outgrow the CSD market. And now Dew is the next area of focus, and
I'm confident we'll see performance improvement in the next quarters in Dew.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.
Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst
So I was just hoping also to talk about beverages and ask for an update on SodaStream. How that's going? And any update on your thinking on
the role that will play in your broader beverage initiative.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, I think we talked during the strategic review. SodaStream Is a long-term strategic bet for us, and it's in multiple dimensions. One is, we think
consumers will be looking for customization of their beverages solutions at home, and I think SodaStream, it is a very good tool to provide that to
consumers. Obviously, we're going to innovate in improving the flavor experience and some other options for consumers to really capture that
need. Obviously, it is -- there is a sustainability angle to SodaStream. And when we think that we're -- we can provide consumers with very good
beverage experiences without packaging, without waste. And that's, I think, a big, big plus for this opportunity.
The performance is good. It's accelerated versus the past. We're not going to disclose specifics. But if you know the past performance of SodaStream,
it is accelerating. The penetration in most of the European countries, which is the #1 KPI we're measuring, keeps increasing. The same in Canada,
the same in the U.S. which are the largest markets for this business. So we feel good about the operational results, and we feel good about the
value that PepsiCo as a company is adding to SodaStream especially in the areas of R&D and flavor innovation, customer relationships and some
of the direct-to-consumer opportunities that this business has.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Crédit Suisse.
Kaumil S. Gajrawala - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst
Ramon, presumably, when you first started, you developed a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year plan and such. And as we think about that, do we think about
the this year's investment spending as a bit of a one and done, and the investment becomes part of the base and we're back to algorithm? Or do
you think of it as, this is the first full year. We have some critical things to do. And then next year, there's a new set of initiatives that require further
step-up to hold momentum or maybe even something different.

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
No, when we talked in February, we're quite clear I think on -- this is a year where we -- we're obviously taking some of our internal monies and
redirecting them, that we needed some additional investments to make sure that we stepped up our performance in some areas. And also, we are
starting to create some capabilities that will hopefully drive the sustain performance in the future. So we remain with the same investment position
as we said in February.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
And to add to that and just to reiterate what Ramon was saying, Kaumil, we talked about next year, we will be back on long-term algorithms. So...
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.
Caroline Shan Levy - Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst
I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the other categories in beverages. There's stepped-up competition coming in coffee. We're just seeing
a lot of new brands as well as the Monster coffee business is doing pretty well; and then needless to say, energy; and again, some great new brands
both in sports and energy and almost a merging of those 2 categories. So if you could talk about your approach to defending share in coffee and
to growing against energy and sports against the newer players, that would be really helpful.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Different market positions in different market segments, right? So in energy, we're challengers, and our opportunity in energy is clearly innovate
to go into spaces that the current players are not now playing. So we're addressing energy from the coffee market. We're addressing energy from
energy, like Game Fuel, with specific positionings within that, narrower but probably more functional. And so we are challengers, and we want to
have that mentality of going after existing leaders in this category and trying to get market share from that segment.
In the other 2 categories that you mentioned, our critical role is to keep building the -- make sure that those categories remain very healthy. They
keep growing above NRB, and that's what's happening with coffees and with sports drinks. They're both growing fast. Our biggest innovation in
beverages is Gatorade Zero. I think it's going to be a, I think, very good innovation, very incremental to the category and good for our share of
market. So we're investing big into Gatorade Zero, and we're investing big into Gatorade. Of course, Propel is doing very well. So we have a
broad-based approach to the sports category, and we see our velocities improving.
When it comes to coffee, the same approach. And we think our role is to continue to innovate in this category, make sure that we premiumize. At
the same time, we give value. We cover all the different spaces where the category can go. And we see our Starbucks coffee partnership very strong
and clearly growing above what is the average of our company, so very accretive.
Some of these players that are coming into our categories, they -- some of them, they stay for long time. Some of them, they come in, and then 2
years later, they're not there. So our approach to this category is sustained innovation; consumer insights to drive the category long term; keep
investing; make sure that we keep driving the growth, the margin expansion of those categories long term.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.
Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
So Ramon, you talked at CAGNY about the importance of investing, among other areas, in more impactful science and design-led innovation. And
you've highlighted on this call, just in response to last question, some of the initiatives you have underway this year as it relates to the beverages.
But when you step back, how would you assess the 2019 innovation and new product pipeline globally relative to what you hope to bring to market
in 2020 or '21? And where might you say you see the most room for incremental improvement there?
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Listen, we're -- as part of the capabilities we're building is this one that you referred to. I think it's critical for us to continue to drive the growth
of our categories, continue to create value for our customers in a sustained way, right? And that's where we're investing. We'll talk to you in the --
probably in the summer about how we're looking at innovation, and from the capability point of view. How we're segmenting different ways of
innovate. I think it's very different how you do a local refresh innovation versus what are the big bets for the company versus how do you do lift
and adapt and lift and shift globally, which is a huge opportunity, as you can imagine, from a -- for a global company. So we'll talk more in the
future.
But of the capabilities that we're investing heavily, and we're repurposing money from other cost lines of our P&L into capabilities. It is innovation,
and it is -- especially the different types of innovation that you were talking about.
We feel good about 2019 from the innovation point of view. And the fact that we're growing 5.2%, it is a reflection of we're growing the core, but
we're also adding some new segments that are very incremental to our top line and also to our categories and our customers who -- we want to
position ourselves as a key growth contributor to our customers through innovation, through category growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.
Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Head of Global Beverages Research
A few related questions on Frito-Lay North America. First, you mentioned that you expect the growth to slow as the year progresses. Is that purely
a function of tougher comps? Second, can you talk about the impact of mix in the quarter, both in terms of the pricing and volume? And third, I
think you've mentioned in the 10-Q that you had double-digit declines in Santitas. If you could talk a little bit about what's going on there?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Hey, Robert, it's Hugh. I'll handle that one. Some of the commentary I gave on Frito-Lay with performance balance of the year is driven by the
lapses as you've anticipated. In addition to that, we had a particularly good January as we had some tightening in areas of our supply chain. We
addressed those issues, and we really had a very big Super Bowl, bigger than we've had in previous years because we unlocked some areas of the
supply chain. So I think that was a big driver for the quarter. Obviously, that's a onetime event. We don't see that repeating over the balance of the
year because it was much more driven by January challenges. Regarding mix in the quarter, it was quite positive, so we certainly feel good about
where Frito-Lay mix is.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.
Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst
Ramon, you mentioned good macros in most of your markets during the quarter. Can you just outline for us how do you see that evolving for the
rest of the year? IMF recently cut down global growth outlook a little bit. Can you just talk about how you'll see that developing for the rest of the
year as well, please?
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Happy to. Listen, we're seeing very good demand for our categories globally. So obviously, I mean, we sell snacks and we sell beverages, so
low-price-point product. But sometimes, the big GDP fluctuations are driven by other components of the GDP, not so much consumption, not so
much consumption of our categories. So the way we tend to look at our business is, is employment good? Is wages and salaries, are they moving
in the right direction? So we see that stay. And we don't see any reasons why in the U.S. or in some of our big markets, this is changing.
ForEx is a big -- has a big impact to our P&L, especially in markets where we -- some of the supply chain comes from outside of the country. And
so far, ForEx has been good, has been stable in the ruble, the euro, the peso, Mexican pesos. So some of our big markets, the ForEx has been good.
So our estimate is that it's going to continue to be quite stable. Having said that, there is always the possibility, obviously, of geopolitical events or
some others that might disrupt some of the demand. So -- but at this point, we feel good about the projections for macros for the balance of the
year.

William Bates Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD
Just want to go back to North America Beverage and just try to understand your commentaries. Are you pleased with the kind of progress of CSDs
in the quarter, that Pepsi was kind of gaining share and pleased with the progress there? But we're only kind of 2 quarters removed or, really, 1
quarter removed from changing the strategy, reinvesting and kind of taking a step back. So trying to understand, are things moving faster than
you expected? Was advertising -- have a bigger impact than you expected this quarter? Or are we still expect -- are there still kind of a step-change
from here?
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
No, we are -- I think the teams are doing a great job. And things are coming as planned, right? So it's a combination of innovation, it's a combination
of good advertising, quantity of advertising, execution in stores and Pepsi has been the focus of our execution in stores, implementing the innovation
and also improving the looks of the products. So things are coming as planned, as you said, 3 into quarters this turnaround strategy. And we are
pleased with the results. I mean growing above CSD category is, I think, is a very good output of the inputs that we put into this. So we feel good
about it.

I'd like to focus my question on the profitability of your international segments. Those increased significantly. Could you give us more color on
where the improvement is coming from? And how sustainable that is in the coming quarters?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Happy to, Laurent. I mean we saw profitability improvement across all 3 of the big segments. We did benefit to some degree in both Russia
and in Mexico from some insurance recoveries. And we put all that in the disclosure so you can back those onetime items out. That said, we saw a
good solid fundamental operating profit performance improvement basically across the big segments even ex those gains.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
First question I have is a housekeeping for Hugh. Free cash flow conversion for the business longer term, understanding that you're ramping up
some spending this year, what's the right free cash flow conversion? And over what period of time you think you can return to it? And then the
strategic question for Ramon. I'm just trying to reconcile some of your comments on sports drinks with what we're seeing in the scan data from a
market share perspective, with PepsiCo down -- or excuse me, Gatorade down 360 basis points in the most recent 4 weeks, and over the past year,
down close to 400 basis points. So when should we expect to see that get better? I'm sure that cannot be satisfying. And then what do we expect
going forward? When should we expect to see some of those trends get better? Is there anything tactically you need to do differently, whether
this is more advertising? Your promos down quite a bit. Your competitor's is up materially. So questions around Gatorade and anything you need
to do tactically and when do share trends get better.
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Why don't I handle the free cash flow question first. We don't give specific guidance on free cash flow. The one thing that we did comment on in
the past, just as a reminder, is that we would see a step-up in CapEx this year and lesser so in the next several years. And we would expect over the
course of about 4 years for that go back -- for that to go back to something around 5%. So as you model that out, I think you'll get to a reasonable
overall cash flow number. Nothing else should be notably different relative to the historical projections on cash flow. It's just a step-up in CapEx.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. And with regards to Gatorade, we're investing in several areas. We're investing in improving our communication and the amount of advertising
as you're saying. We're improving the packaging of the product. I think there is an opportunity to improve the packaging. And then most importantly,
we're going after additional consumers. And Gatorade Zero is a very strategic intentional innovation to go after consumers that have left Gatorade
franchise because of the sugar level, so people that still want the same efficacy when it comes to hydration but want less sugar. From the early
reads that we have on Gatorade Zero, it is performing as we intended in terms of expanding the category capture in new consumers and driving
incrementality for the brand. So we're very hopeful that those 3 levers will help us regain growth.
The fact of the matter is that we also have other brands play in that space. Propel is a great brand that we have in that space of sports hydration
with a different positioning, but growing very fast. And we'll come up with some other innovations. Obviously, I cannot disclose for competitive
reasons. But there is new innovation coming up that hopefully will attack some spaces in the current sports overall category where we're probably

I think we will, as I'm saying, we will improve the performance of our sports set of brands and products in the coming quarters.

Your next question comes from the line of Sean King of UBS.
Sean Roberts King - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst of Beverages
I guess now that you've closed the CytoSport deal, how do you see the -- I guess, do see any incremental channel or category innovation opportunities
to build on that investment?
Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Hey, Sean, this is Hugh. I think you'll see us now that we sort of have control of the brand there combine with the Gatorade shakes business
that we have, sort of craft a premium and mainstream approach to that business and to clearly appeal to different consumer segments. And we
think by virtue of owning that business, we'll be able to have more success with both of those brands. So more to come on that, but that's sort of
the broad thinking behind the move that we made.
Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. And we think there is obviously executional opportunities with this brands, but most importantly, within this category, it's going to grow fast
in the coming years. And we want to make sure that we have full ownership of the full value chain so that we can innovate both, as Hugh was
saying, with multiple brands, to make sure that we cover all the spaces, more functional, more lifestyle, more premium, more value. So there's a
lot of -- I think there's a lot of ways how we can help accelerate a category that has a lot of consumer tailwinds already. So it's a good strategic
acquisition for us, make sure that we drive this category to its maximum.
Okay, so this is the last question. Thank you all of you for your time and participation in this morning's call. To conclude, just a summary. We are
pleased with our results for the first quarter. We're executing against our key priorities with a very high sense of urgency. We remain on track to
achieve our 2019 financial goals. And lastly, we thank you for your confidence that you've placed in PepsiCo with your investment. Thank you.

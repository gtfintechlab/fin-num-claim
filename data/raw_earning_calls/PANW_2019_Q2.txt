Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Thank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal second quarter 2019 results. I 
will briefly go through our financials, give you a progress update on our three focus areas of securing the 
enterprise, securing the cloud, and securing to our Application Framework. And finally, I'll provide a little more 
color on the Demisto acquisition.
Starting with our financials, I'm pleased to report that the team has delivered another outstanding quarter. Fiscal 
Q2 revenue of $711 million represents year-over-year growth of 30%, and non-GAAP earnings per share 
increased by 44% to $1.51.
There were a number of big wins this quarter. We have a few I'd like to highlight. We continue to see success 
around the world in our next-generation firewall business. People are getting more security conscious and want to 
deploy our firewall with the attached subscriptions.
To note, during the quarter, we did a large deal with a data center in Europe at one of the most prestigious car 
manufacturers, and had a significant expansion of our hardware footprint in one of the largest online gaming 
companies in the world as well as in one of the largest retailers in the world.
We are beginning to see the fruits of our speedboats strategy. With our increased focus on Global Protect Cloud 
Service [GPCS], we've had a few spectacular wins, one to secure 25,000 mobile users at a global financial 
services company, and another to secure 80,000 mobile users for one of France's largest state-owned public 
services.
We also won a very large VM-Series deal with several subsidiaries of one of the largest broadcasting companies 
in the United States. And we won a deal to secure 47,000 endpoints at one of the largest university healthcare 
systems in the United States as well.
Expanding more on our three strategy focus areas, first let me talk about securing the enterprise. Over the last 
11-plus years, we transformed the network security market with our next-generation firewall. We use the firewall 
as a platform to deliver tightly integrated security services. We've had great success with our attached 
subscriptions, the most successful ones having attach rates of about 90%.
Earlier this month, we announced the release of PAN-OS Version 9.0, which added over 60 new features, 
including the policy optimizer, which helps teams replace legacy rules with intuitive policies that provide better 
security and are easier to manage.
I'm excited about our new DNS Security subscription. This is our first new attached subscription since 2011. This 
subscription utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics to proactively block malicious domains and stop 
attacks in progress, the only service with this level of capability to be integrated with a firewall. This continues our 
practice of reducing the number of disparate point products and making security better, easier, and more 
effective.
We are working hard on future subscriptions in our software releases, providing our customers more integration 
for their cybersecurity solutions in their enterprise. We believe the next-generation firewall will continue to serve 
as a platform for security services in the enterprise.

We also have expanded our hardware family. Our new PA-7000 Series features throughput capabilities at two 
times the nearest competitor and will be especially useful to customers with large data centers and high volumes 
of encrypted traffic.
Additionally, we announced availability of our K2-Series. As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, the 
service provider market has become a lot more interesting to us with the adoption of IoT and the advent of 5G, 
where security will be a primary concern. Our new K2-Series addresses this market, simplifying operations by 
offering unprecedented visibility, automation, and consistent protection.
And finally, we continued our investments in advanced endpoint protection. With Traps 6.0, which we announced 
earlier today, endpoint security just got a lot better. The new Behavior Threat Prevention engine allows Traps to 
prevent attacks based on their behavior. Traps 6.0 also introduces container security protections and rich data 
collection for XDR, which I will talk more about later. We're proud to serve close to 4,000 Traps customers, almost 
half of whom manage Traps from the cloud.
Turning to our second focus area, the cloud, we continue to be laser-focused on delivering technology that 
enables our customers in their cloud journey by delivering the broadest set of security capabilities across all 
clouds and cloud configurations. As of the second quarter, approximately 8,000 customers are using our cloud 
offering.
The speedboat we created around cloud and the acquisition of RedLock last quarter is already showing positive 
results, as we have exceeded the original forecast for our RedLock business by more than 50%. This is a great 
example of the power of combining a best-in-class product with Palo Alto Networks' execution and distribution.
Additionally, our in-line cloud security VM-Series was recently expanded to include support for the Oracle cloud 
and the initial trials of the Alibaba cloud. We improved performance of the product by up to 2.5 times and added 
many new and enhanced capabilities for operating in both public and private cloud environments. We're very 
pleased with our continued progress with VM-Series and the success we're seeing with customers.
The third focus area of our strategy is harnessing the power of advanced AI and machine learning. We started 
this strategy with the announcement of Application Framework 18 months ago and are now proud to announce 
Application Framework 2.0, which is now called Cortex. We believe this is how security will be managed in the 
future.
Cortex is a significant evolution of the Application Framework. It is the industry's only open and integrated AIbased continuous security platform. Cortex has been deployed in the public cloud, allowing us to leverage its 
features and scale and rapidly deploy AI.
We're also announcing the first application available for Cortex, called Cortex XDR. Built to empower SOC 
analysts, Cortex XDR enables teams to stop sophisticated attacks and adapt their defenses to prevent future 
threats. Cortex XDR goes far beyond traditional EDR that only works on endpoint data. It breaks down the silos 
created by legacy technologies to offer the first-ever detection, investigation, and response product that natively 
integrates network, endpoint, and cloud data. It reduces the signal-to-noise ratio that has being plaguing security 
analysts. It accurately uncovers threats using machine learning, simplifies investigations automation, and stops 
attacks before damage is done through tight integration with existing enforcement points.
Cortex XDR is being launched in conjunction with Traps 6.0, our new endpoint product that I mentioned before. 
Now Traps is enhanced for even better endpoint protection. Using its behavioral threat protection engine, it stops

advanced threats in real time by stitching together a chain of events to spot malicious activity. When combined 
with Cortex XDR, customers can use Traps to extend their prevention capabilities to include detection and 
response across their entire digital infrastructure from a single agent. The more powerful Traps product acts as 
the ultimate data collection sensor for Cortex as well, collecting the most comprehensive data in the industry.
We're confident in the uniqueness of our approach. So to make sure our customers can take full advantage of 
Cortex XDR, we have decided today to include endpoint protection free of charge when they purchase Cortex 
XDR. Yes, we're declaring our newly developed advanced Traps 6.0 product as free if purchased with Cortex 
XDR. We believe that for true comprehensive investigation of advanced attacks, the data is critical. Customers 
can now deploy one single endpoint agent that prevents, detects, and responds to attacks across their entire 
digital infrastructure.
To help us roll out Cortex XDR, we're also announcing partnerships with five managed security service provider 
partners, who will deliver 24x7 threat monitoring, detection, and response services to our customers. We are 
excited about these partnerships with Pricewaterhouse, Critical Start, ON2IT, BDO, and Trustwave. They will 
provide an important service to our customers and demonstrate industry confidence in our Cortex platform.
These are all exciting changes, and I cannot thank our product team enough for stepping up to the challenge of 
integration and speed in solving our customers' problems.
Lastly, I would like to provide more color on Demisto. Last week we announced the proposed acquisition of 
Demisto. Demisto is a leader in the evolving space called SOAR. We believe that Demisto's multi-vendor 
orchestration capabilities and unique analytics and playbooks will help our customers further automate significant 
parts of their security operations and allow them to turn their attention to solving unique and complex threats. 
Demisto, already a partner of Cortex, now will integrate even more tightly into our plans for AI and ML on Cortex.
Demisto has an ambitious plan for 2019, with billings projections of approximately $50 million to $55 million. To 
facilitate and support achievement of this plan, we will have Demisto operate in a separate speedboat under the 
leadership of Slavik Markovitch, their CEO, leveraging the broader Palo Alto Networks distribution engine. At the 
same time, Slavik will work closely with Lee Klarich and me to accelerate the next step for customer solutions.
As I mentioned on the call we held last week, with the addition of Demisto, we now have made a couple of 
acquisitions over the last six months. While we continue to evaluate companies, my primary focus is on making 
sure these acquisitions are successful, and we are delighted with both customer reaction and our initial results.
In closing, as we approach RSA next week, we know there will be a robust debate about whether the endpoint or 
the firewall is the center of security. In our mind, this debate is looking at security through too narrow a lens.
We believe the future of security is about data. It's about data, it's about machine learning from the data, and 
orchestrating and automating responses. And for customers who are struggling to manage too many 
disconnected security point products, we believe that our platform approach to security, with high levels of 
integration, analytics, and automation, is the answer for the future of security. We believe Cortex is the future.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.

Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP, and 
growth rates are compared to the prior-year period unless stated otherwise. All current and prior period financials 
discussed are reflected under ASC 606, as we adopted the new standard as of August 1, 2018.
In the second quarter, we once again added new customers at a rapid pace while also driving robust expansion 
business. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase in Q2, spent a minimum of $35.6 million in lifetime 
value, a 39% increase compared to the same period last year.
In the second quarter, total revenue grew 30% to $711.2 million. By geography, Q2 revenue grew 27% in the 
Americas, 38% in EMEA, 35% in APAC.
Q2 product revenue of $271.6 million grew 33% compared to the prior year. Q2 SaaS-based subscription revenue 
of $249.7 million increased 36%. Support revenue of $189.9 million increased 21%. In total, subscription and 
support revenue of $439.6 million increased 29% and accounted for 62% of total revenue.
Our non-attached offerings continue to show strong momentum, and we exited the second quarter with run rate
billings of approximately $383 million, growing approximately 60% year over year. Q2 total billings of $852.5 
million increased 27% year over year. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscription and support 
billings in the quarter was approximately three years.
For the first half of fiscal 2019, billings of $1.6 billion increased 27% year over year. Product billings were $514.9 
million, up 33%, and accounted for 32% of total billings. Subscription billings were $646.7 million, up 30%. 
Support billings were $449.4 million, up 17%.
Total deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $2.5 billion, an increase of 32%.
Q2 gross margin was 76.3%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to last year. Q2 operating expenses were 
$367.5 million, or 51.7% of revenue, which represents a 220 basis point improvement year over year. Operating 
margin was 24.6%, an increase of 250 basis points.
We ended the second quarter with 5,856 employees.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 49% to $147 million, or $1.51 per diluted share. Our nonGAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 22%. On a GAAP basis for the second quarter, net loss declined by 90% to 
$2.6 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted share.
Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items, we finished January with cash, cash equivalents, and investments 
of $3.6 billion.
During the quarter, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, which was effective through 
December 31, 2018. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of 
approximately $178 per share. On February 22, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share 
repurchase program. The new repurchase authorization will expire on December 31, 2020.
Turning to cash flow, Q2 cash flow from operations of $275.4 million increased 13%. Free cash flow for the 
quarter was $251.9 million. This figure was impacted by approximately $15 million of imputed interest expense 
associated with redemptions of the 2019 convertible debt. Adjusting for this and other cash charges, free cash

flow in the quarter was $271.4 million, up 21% at a margin of 38.2%. Capital expenditures during the quarter were 
$23.5 million. DSO was 50 days, a decline of 9 days from the prior-year period.
Turning now to guidance and modeling points, for fiscal Q3 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $697 
million to $707 million, an increase of 23% to 25% year over year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range 
of $1.23 to $1.25, which includes expenses related to the proposed Demisto acquisition, using approximately 99 
million to 101 million shares.
Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes 
a net increase in M&A expense of approximately $5 million or $0.04 per share attributable to the proposed 
Demisto acquisition. In the first 12 months following the acquisition, we expect Demisto billings of approximately 
$50 million to $55 million.
Our EPS guidance also includes an expected $0.01 impact due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese origin goods. We 
expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx will be approximately $20 million to $25 million.
To help you model billings for the remainder of the year, we are comfortable with current consensus for the 
second half of the year. And for fiscal 2019, including acquisition-related operating expenses, we expect an 
adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. This fiscal 2019 number is adjusted for one-time items, 
consisting of the previously communicated $97 million related to the settlement of 2019 convertible debt and 
between $35 million to $40 million of cash flow associated with our new headquarters in Santa Clara.
With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Today our first question comes from Walter Pritchard, Citi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter H. Pritchard
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Hi. Could you give us an update on service provider? It sounds like you're still pretty excited about that 
opportunity. I don't know if you're willing to express it as a percentage of revenue or whatnot, but curious for an 
update on that. And then I have a product-related follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Hi, Walter. Thanks for your question. Look, as I mentioned when we launched K2, and we talked about it last 
quarter, we believe the tweaks to the 5G opportunity is a unique opportunity. And the whole focus on IoT, we 
have been talking to a whole bunch of telcos and service providers out there. And there's a twinkle in their eye 
when we start talking about the B2B use case for 5G, where they would not have cared as much if – I shouldn't 
say that for them, but they were not as focused on individual consumers and the ability to hack their phones or 
their lax security.
But as it comes to B2B use cases, providing bandwidth at the edge, they are very concerned of making sure that 
their B2B customers have a secure tunnel going all the way from their devices or their cars or whatever they

choose to implement, their healthcare devices or rigs, back to their cloud. And we believe our firewall is uniquely 
positioned to solve that problem for them in the K2 firewall space.
So we're very happy with a lot of conversations we're having. We're beginning to start seeing requests for 
integrating that and some sort of testing with them. So all I can say is early days, but we're happy with the 
direction the conversations are taking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter H. Pritchard
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
And then maybe for Kathy, on the endpoint side, I guess that's been a market where you didn't really have a 
complete solution arguably until now. Should we think about seeing a pretty significant ramp in that, in net 
revenue here as you go in the second half of your fiscal year, given you now have a complete product and you 
have some of those new relationships and so forth, or is that maybe too ambitious, so we should think about that 
as more of a fiscal 2020 driver?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, we're very excited about the new Traps 6.0 and of course Cortex XDR, which will leverage Traps 6.0. We 
think that it's going to be a very compelling solution for our customers. And so we obviously have a lot of 
confidence in our ability to drive acceptance of that product in the marketplace.
In terms of what's going to drive our overall revenue performance, I'm really not going to start to get into those 
kinds of details. But we're very excited about Traps 6.0 and think that it offers us a great potential for the future.

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Okay, thank you.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead, Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karl E. Keirstead
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Thank you, maybe one Nikesh and one for Kathy. Nikesh, the product revenue growth acceleration to 33% I think 
was super-impressive. I'm wondering if you could just comment on where you saw strength, either by appliance 
family or vertical perhaps. Maybe just give a little color on if there is any particular driver of that.
And then, Kathy, the question for you is really on the margin outperformance. I don't think anybody was modeling 
a 250 basis point margin improvement. I'm assuming that something occurred on the sales and marketing line. 
Maybe you could offer some color as to whether any expenses were deferred out of 2Q into 3Q or if there's 
anything else unusual. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Hey, Karl, thanks for the question. Look, I think I'd just say that there's no specific driver, but the general level of 
activity we're seeing out in the marketplace. As we've talked about this in the past that every time something 
happens in a market where a customer gets breached or somebody gets breached, there's a heightened sense of

awareness in security. All I can tell you is that the conversations are getting more and more up-leveled in terms of 
preparedness for organizations for security, and we are seeing more and more security consciousness.
From a vertical perspective, we've always done better. More people care more about security. Fed has been 
strong for us, financial services have been strong for us, but we're seeing that peter down into other verticals. So 
I'd just say that it's generally strength across the board, and that's probably what has driven the revenue on the 
product front this quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
And I'll just address the margin comment by saying they're very related. The strong product mix that we saw in the 
quarter obviously drives higher revenue yield, so that obviously is helping our margins. But in addition, we have 
been driving leverage in the business. And in Q2, we saw operating expense as a percentage of revenue decline 
by 220 basis points, as I mentioned in my remarks. And you're right that sales and marketing is driving that 
number and the leverage that we're seeing. And we've seen that for the last several quarters, good leverage in 
terms of sales and marketing expense overall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Fatima Boolani
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question, one for Nikesh and one for Kathy. Nikesh, one of the things 
that you've talked about and have been focusing on is packaging your cloud solutions in a better way and also 
taking steps to ensure the entire portfolio, which has expanded quite dramatically over the last couple of years, 
making sure the entire portfolio is better integrated. So I wanted to understand the mile markers and progress 
you've made on that front, and to what extent that has been influencing deal sizes, deal trends, and especially 
that customer lifetime value metric that continues to grow apace. And then a follow-up for Kathy, if I may.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Sure, Fatima, thanks for your question. Look, I think I'm very excited that in eight months we've been able to 
create real focus around the three areas. I highlighted the enterprise side. And expanding your question a little bit 
more, on the enterprise side, as I said in our prepared remarks that I think this company had done a phenomenal 
job in building a firewall and putting subscriptions on top of firewalls.
Basically, once you put a firewall in a customer's infrastructure, which is a hard decision because you're 
introducing another piece in their infrastructure, which is now delivered to you by a cybersecurity vendor. It's 
incumbent upon us to provide more and more solutions to the customer which can be triggered off the firewall.

And I think the product team really rallied in the last eight months and we've built our first attached subscription 
after 2011 in our DNS Security service. And the team is really charged about building more capability to our 
firewalls. We have 60,000 customers of our firewall.
So the ability to take that to our customers and say look, you don't need another appliance in your infrastructure, 
you don't need another solution. It all works off of Palo Alto Networks pane, management pane, and we'll give you 
more and more capability from the firewalls you do deploy, and that for me is very exciting. So that's a point of 
integration and mile marker, like you called it, for integration for us on the enterprise side.
On the cloud side, we're slowly and steadily working towards better integration. We're excited about our RedLock 
progress. We're excited of our GPCS progress, as I highlighted. These are big wins for us, and the team is getting 
more and more excited. We're deploying more people across the regions to make sure we have the capability and 
the ability to go compete with the people out there offering these solutions. You can expect us to provide more 
proof-points about integration in further quarters. We don't have anything to announce on the cloud side yet.
I think we just announced Cortex this morning. I think the marketing team has done a phenomenal job. The 
product team has done a phenomenal job in deploying Application Framework 2.0. That was off last quarter what 
will be the proof-point of us being able to show true integration across multiple data points, and Cortex XDR is 
that. It is the only service in the industry which have planned endpoint, cloud, and network data as a point of 
integration. So we believe we are making tremendous progress towards our aspirations to provide more 
integrated services, and you can expect us to do more and more of that.

That super-helpful. And, Kathy, maybe a question for you on gross margin, certainly a little better than we were 
looking for. I just wanted to understand how you've been navigating some of the supply chain constraints as a 
consequence of the tariffs. And how much longer should we expect that headwind to persist? And at the same 
time as the cloud solution build-out and you probably have greater scale, how should we think about impacting –
how we should think about those investments impacting gross margins as well? And that's it for me, thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Sure. So in terms of our gross margin improvement during the quarter, we've said that with the new products that 
we introduced now almost two years ago, we've made a concerted effort to ensure that we're able to improve the 
margins on those products over time, and we've definitely been able to do that. And so we've seen some 
improvement in that product gross margin over time.
We also have seen some improvement in terms of just memory pricing, which we talked about. Memory pricing 
seems to be stabilizing now. We do still have some issues in terms of more commoditized parts being more 
expensive than they have been in the past. But overall, we indicated an impact of $0.01 to $0.02 in this quarter 
due to the tariff. So it's kind of a mixed bag, we're seeing some improvements and we also have the negative 
influences. Overall, we did see an increase of about 30 basis points year over year, which obviously we're very 
pleased about given the current environment.
In terms of cloud investments and where we see that going, obviously, you've also seen some declines in our 
services margin, as we have been investing in those businesses. We think that there's a lot of potential for us to 
build really big nicely sized businesses in the cloud, and there's a great opportunity for us. So we're definitely 
investing in those areas in order to ensure that we can capture the market opportunity.

John DiFucci
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Thank you. My first question is actually for Lee. So, Lee, I think you mentioned or it might have been Nikesh on 
the last call that the new telco class appliance you're coming out with, I assume that's the PA-7000. I guess, if you 
could, just let us know if that's right. Or is that replacing other products? And I guess if it is, then should we expect 
further launches to address this market, a market you really haven't been in very much in the past?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Good question, so let me just start by clarifying. The PA-7000 Series and specifically the new modules that were 
introduced and launched as part of the 9.0 release earlier this month, that is the basis for the K2-Series. But the 
K2-Series is an optimized hardware platform targeted for service providers and specifically the mobile networks 
as we see those transitioning from 4G to 5G, and then with 5G, the advent of much broader IoT and in particular 
high-value and sensitive IoT devices coming onto those that need security. So they are related, but they are 
different offerings.
Relative to service provider overall, we have been in this space, in this market selling to service providers. We 
have seen success across different parts of the portfolio. The K2-Series though is the first time we've designed 
and built a product specifically for that market to really go capture the specialized opportunity that exists there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John DiFucci

And we're still waiting on the K2-Series. Is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
No, the K2-Series is now available as of earlier this month.

John DiFucci
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And, Kathy, just a clarification, the results were strong across all revenue categories, 
but especially in the product areas. I just want to make sure we understand it correctly. Is all the attached 
subscriptions something that I think both you and Nikesh talked about in your prepared remarks, is all of that in 
the subscription line, or is there any of that in the license line due to ASC 606 in the way on-premise subscription 
is treated under that standard?

A portion of the VM-Series, which we talked about and when we talked at the beginning of Q1 regarding ASC 
606, a portion of our VM-Series is recognized up front in that category.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John DiFucci
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Okay, so it's in that line item on the income statement, in the license line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno

That's correct. That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John DiFucci
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Okay. Was there any shift? Is there a continuing shift to more subscription or more what would be that kind of 
revenue, on-premise subscription, or do you have it all on the license line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
No, in terms of what is driving the growth there, that's really not a driver of the growth, not a significant driver of 
the growth in any respect. Obviously, we've made the adjustment both in this year's recognition of VM-Series and 
last year's recognition of VM-Series. And while we're seeing growth there, obviously it's not as big a portion of our 
business as the rest of our product revenues are. And so the real impact is what we're seeing in terms of the rest 
of the product category.

Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results, a few product-centric questions here. One, how

deal. We've spent a lot of time in making sure we get the underlying platform right. And we think by deploying it on

the public cloud and using the features that come where you can handle massive amounts of data and being able 
to leverage the native AI tools, and that is very useful.
I think XDR is very critical. I think XDR is a service which there's a whole bunch of startups out there trying to 
provide that kind of service. I think it's different when we deploy that service where you can leverage the data you 
collect from Palo Alto firewalls and from Traps and from our cloud security sensors. Actually there are many 
customers who deployed all three from us. So we have the opportunity to go to them and say look, you already 
have them. Here's a real tool that can help in your SOC see a whole bunch of stuff that was not available in the 
past.
I think Demisto was something that I think you and I haven't talked about this and we haven't talked much about it 
because I wasn't going to talk to you about until we figured out we wanted it. But I think when we went out to our 
customers, the customers' big challenge is I've got so many cybersecurity solutions, I'm getting 3 to 10 times 
more alerts than I was getting two to five years ago, and I'm going to have to hire more and more analysts to 
figure out how to solve the alerts. So this cannot be a punitive damage. The more secure I want to feel, the more 
products I need to deploy, the more people I have to hire to solve the alerts that you guys send me.
So we realized that there is a crescendo where people are saying I need more help solving these alerts than 
going out and generating. I think Demisto fits squarely in that sore spot in the industry, no pun intended. And one 
other opportunity we have is to be able to take that and leverage that across the entire Application Framework, 
where we can leverage that across data from not just Palo Alto Networks, but other vendors, and Demisto has 
already mastered that art.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Just to piggyback on top of what Nikesh said, I think one of the ways to think about this is we do want to actually 
encourage customers to have more alerts, like more data is always a good thing, but only if for the majority of that 
we can automatically deal with that. And that is where Demisto will fit in as that automated playbooks and 
analytics to deal with the large volume of alerts coming in.
And then XDR provides that ability to stitch together data from different sources, really understand it, and 
proactively present it to the SOC analysts for the more sophisticated attacks, where you actually need an analyst 
to spend some time understanding it, investigating it, and initiating responses. So they do work very hand-in-hand 
in terms of how a SOC analyst would think of the capabilities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gur Yehudah Talpaz
Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Q
That's actually really helpful. And then, Nikesh, you talked about a strong customer response for Demisto. But I 
want to know if you had a chance to talk with any integrated vendors yet, and if you've gotten any response yet 
from those that have worked directly with Demisto in the past and how they viewed the integration and acquisition 
going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
We haven't had that opportunity. I think it's fair to understand that the biggest role in this process belongs to the 
customer because Demisto is deploying in a customer's infrastructure with their explicit permission to be able to 
access the data from the customer and remediate back into their infrastructure. And they built the product on the

back of open connectors that are available from every vendor out there. So there is no proprietary connectivity 
that Demisto leverages that is going to change by the acquisition, if that's where your question is headed. In 
addition, Demisto will also have access to a lot of Palo Alto data, which is just impossible for us to deploy 
anywhere else but in Cortex.

Operator: Your next question comes from Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gabriela Borges
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Good afternoon, thank you. Nikesh, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the monetization opportunities 
around XDR. We talked about monetization with the Application Framework more broadly, maybe just specifically 
on XDR. And the decision to include Traps within the broader bundle, just some puts and takes on how you 
thought about that. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Sure, thank you. Look, again, I'm going to give you a little overview, and Lee will jump in hopefully. From an XDR 
perspective, I think our thesis going into it was the thesis of integration, and this is something the company had 
already been working on for a while with the acquisitions of Secdo and LightCyber. We needed to figure out how 
to take all this data and provide it consistently in one way as opposed to deploying more and more tools against 
the infrastructure. So XDR for us is very, very important because it is actually the first critical application from our 
end which integrates data from all the three sensors that I mentioned. So it's very important as we get into the 
SOC business.
And also part of the observation we've had is that as more and more sophisticated tools get developed, it 
becomes impossible for customers to train their SOC analysts across multiple tools. So if you noticed, I 
mentioned this but I want to highlight it that we've actually partnered with five partners who are going to help us 
manage this as it gets deployed in the SOC because we believe the true leverage is from being able to fully utilize 
the product across all the data that we've collected or we will be collecting for XDR.
In terms of the Traps decision, I think if you look at the endpoint industry, and I stated at it hard over the last eight 
months, there are a lot of vendors and there are a lot of vendors who used to do a certain set of features. There 
are new vendors who do a certain set of new features. And we've sat and thought about how we could make sure 
that Traps over time becomes the ubiquitous endpoint agent in the market.
And we realized that endpoint protection in its most advanced form should become table stakes. Every customer 
should have it. But the endpoint agent has in my mind at least two major features. One is to provide protection at 
the endpoint, but as importantly is to provide data to be able to go back into a cloud database, if you will, which 
allows them both to leverage it across other security solutions, but also be able to send behavior and trend data 
back to the endpoint.
So we thought bundling Traps and XDR would be the right outcome. And because we want ubiquity on Traps, we 
want to make sure that's available free to our customers, they can deploy it. And as you probably know,

customers have multiple endpoint agents running in their infrastructure. They're not required to replace anything. 
This is just a free product that they can deploy, which allows us to leverage XDR more effectively for that 
customer. Lee thinks I – he has coached me well and he's giving me a thumbs up, which means he doesn't have 
anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gabriela Borges
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
And the follow-up is for Lee. I think he might know the answer to this. When you look at your customer base on 
next-gen firewall, do you have a sense for to what extent your customers have standardized on Palo Alto 
deployments for the firewall versus maybe a still dual-sourcing or have multiple firewall vendors? Can some of the 
new policy rules in the features that you have in 9.0 help with that standardization effort?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Klarich
Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Yes, that's a great question. The high-level answer is obviously going to be it depends. It depends on a number of 
things such as how large the customer is, when they initially became a customer of Palo Alto Networks, and 
where they are in that journey.
We see certainly with a lot of our customers, they often will initially purchase for a particular project, deploy, gain 
success out of that, and then use that success to leverage across other parts of their infrastructure over time. 
Obviously, we try to accelerate that in capabilities like the Policy Optimizer actually allows us to help accelerate 
that by moving them more quickly into the kind of security policies we think and they think are better, both from a 
security perspective as well as a ease-of-operation perspective.
The second aspect to that is the more they are able to see the value and consume the value of additional 
subscription services on top of that, whether that's a threat prevention subscription, WildFire, PAN-DB, URL 
filtering, GlobalProtect, or now with 9.0 the DNS Security service, the more value they see out of using us as their 
primary firewall and infrastructure, which also then often drives broader consumption and usage. And so it is a 
journey, but what we see both in terms of utilization as well as footprint does continue to expand.

Sterling Auty
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi. I'm curious how you guys think about the need for product growth moving forward within the overall growth of 
total revenue. You started as a razor-and-razorblade model. Now you have a substantial amount of non-attached 
subscription. So how fast does product have to grow moving forward for you to deliver on your growth goals?

Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
That's a good question. I think, look, we like more and more customers to deploy our firewall. So from that 
perspective, yes, we'd like to see product growth. But we want to see both depth and breadth, and that's why 
we're embarked on a rejuvenation on our subscription services because we believe that the firewall can offer 
multiple subscriptions to our customers, and where we found good success and update every time we've 
deployed a new subscription. And we just want to increase the intensity of those subscriptions because today 
there are still many point products that are being deployed in the infrastructure.
So we see the firewall not just, as I said, like as an in-line firewall that protects you, but we also see that as a 
platform to be able to deploy more and more services where the customers don't need to deploy more things. So 
for our growth plan, it is important for us to get both depth and breadth on the product side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sterling Auty
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
That makes sense, and then one follow-up. On Demisto, you gave us a sense of the aspirations on the billings 
front. But how does the contract structure look, and how do we think about the billings flowing into revenue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora

Kathy, did you want to not answer that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Demisto operates with a ratable model for the most part. And so we would expect a ratable revenue model with 
the Demisto acquisition. Does that answer your question, Sterling?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sterling Auty
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Sort of. So in other words, we should expect the revenue contribution initially to be small, but for it to layer in. So 
in that four-quarter look, the second half should be substantially bigger than the first half, or is that the wrong way 
to look at it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
I think you're on the right track that revenue does lag in terms of – revenue does lag bookings in a ratable revenue 
model. So you've got that correct.

Hamza Fodderwala
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Hi, this is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss, just a couple quick questions from my end. Looking at the fiscal 
Q3 guidance and it implies a slight sequential downtick in revenue versus Q2, which is unlike what we've seen in 
the past. So to what extent is that caution related to the macro environment, whether it be tariffs or spillover 
effects from the federal government shutdown, or just typical conservatism in your forward guidance?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, I wouldn't read any sort of macro comment into our guidance. We're guiding a very respectable 23% to 25% 
year-over-year revenue growth range on a pretty tough compare last year. So we feel very comfortable with 
where we are in terms of our guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hamza Fodderwala
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Got it, and just a follow-up question on free cash flow margin. You mentioned 36% free cash flow margin roughly 
for the full year. Does that include the one-time payments, or does that exclude that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kathy Bonanno
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A

leadership there. I think it's just – in my mind it's really getting out there in front of customers and presenting our 
solutions and penetrating the market. So it's just good execution on the part of our EMEA team.
And all I can say is from prior experience, a U.S.-based company is very focused in U.S. right at the start. Over 
time it's trying to expand globally, and we have a lot more room we think in our international markets. And we're 
going to be continuing to focus on execution not just in the U.S., but in EMEA, as we shown and various parts of 
Asia-Pacific and Latin America.

Shaul Eyal

That's fair enough, and a follow-up if I may. Linearity trends if I'm looking at the past few quarters seem to be 
slightly improving, not as back-end loaded as prior ones. I'm just looking for some color if possible on that specific 
point. Thank you for that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Our linearity in terms of when our bookings come in has remained fairly consistent over time. We do see, 
depending on the quarter, for example, in the quarter just ended December, obviously it's a year-end month. And 
so we see different linearity in the quarter than we do in other quarters, but that's been very consistent over time.

Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. On the site with the launch this morning, you said you had 60,000 
enterprise customers. And if I just look at that versus the end of the year, it's up about, call it 6,000, which is 
actually ahead of where you were through the first half of fiscal 2018. So obviously you continue to add net new 
customers at a very healthy pace.
When you start to think about forward guidance, even just medium-term planning, how are you thinking about 
prioritization of go-to-market between upsell of obviously what is a growing product portfolio in the existing 
installed base versus continuing to land new customers?

I think part of the challenge we've given to the sales team is we've got to be able to walk and chew gum at the 
same time, so we're going to have to do a bit of both. I think to be able to sustain the growth aspirations we have, 
you have to go out and expand in our existing base. We also have to be able to land new customers because we 
have a lot of new products that we're trying to deploy, which will be deployed both in our existing customers and 
newer customers. So maybe more receptive to our new products which we are deploying in the cloud space, in 
the Cortex space. We really are trying to focus on both ends.
The opportunity to go to existing customers and sell them existing product, new product of course is great 
because they are already have experienced our products, have deployed them, and have the training and the 
experience on the products, but we're challenging our teams to try and do a bit of both.

Got it. And then just to follow up on that in terms of obviously the healthy net new customer adds, any changes 
that you're seeing in those deals in terms of just win rates versus the competition, your pricing in those deals, et 
cetera, just any color on that would be great.

Our win rates haven't changed substantially over the last 12 months or the last eight months at least since I've 
been here. I think it's been pretty consistent across the board. We are seeing better traction obviously in some of 
our newer products which we haven't seen in the past. Hence, the growth rate is sustaining lower 60%, as Kathy 
mentioned. So we are seeing traction there, we are seeing our teams beginning to form around it. So we have 
high expectations from the team in that area.
But generally across from a landscape perspective, one of you highlighted the success we're seeing more in 
EMEA. So clearly, that's more of a penetration strategy. So I think it's just steady execution across all fronts. And 
where we feel that we need to go in step in and create more effort, we do by constantly inspecting our processes.

Operator: Your last question comes from Ken Talanian, Evercore.

Analyst, Evercore ISI Q
Guys, thanks for taking the question. Are you seeing most customers make enterprise-wide purchases of 
GlobalProtect cloud, or most of the deals thus far more representative of a land-and-expand opportunity?

Look, there are customers who already have policy network firewalls deployed, and they're used to our Panorama 
management pane, so they understand how to set up policies, how to make them work, and then GlobalProtect 
cloud has become an extension of their security posture.
But we've also seen, as I highlighted, two wins we have had. We've also seen situations where we walked in and 
a customer has deployed GlobalProtect cloud service because they believe it's a more secure product than the 
other product which is competitive, which I cannot name, I forgot.

Okay. And last question, have you made or do you plan to make any changes this year to salesforce 
compensation or the compensation terms?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nikesh Arora
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. A
Look, we're constantly adapting our sales force's compensation to make sure it meets the objectives we've set for 
ourselves. In the quarter, we also take feedback based on where our expectations were different from what has 
transpired in the market. But there's nothing substantive that we have changed or we plan to change during the 
course of our year because so far it seems to be working.

I would agree. Thank you.

Supplemental Financial Information
For the Period Ended June 30, 2022
(Unaudited)
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements within this document include the accounts of Datadog, Inc. 
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Datadog" or the "Company"), and have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”).
The Company also discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures within this document: non-GAAP gross profit, 
non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing and general 
and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), nonGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic share, and free cash flow. Datadog 
uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across 
accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to 
evaluate Datadog’s financial performance. Datadog believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP 
measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. Datadog’s non-GAAP financial measures 
may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other 
companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and 
unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial 
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Datadog’s reported financial results.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information 
prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly 
comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.
Datadog defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and 
development, sales and marketing and general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP 
operating margin and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for, as applicable: (1) 
stock-based compensation expense; (2) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) non-cash benefit related to tax 
adjustment; (4) employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions; and (5) amortization of issuance costs.
Datadog defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures and minus 
capitalized software development costs, if any. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical 
non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing Datadog’s 
operating performance due to the following factors:
Stock-based compensation. Datadog utilizes stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally 
aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address 
operational performance for any particular period. As a result, stock-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that 
are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.
Amortization of acquired intangibles. Datadog views amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising from preacquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment 
regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during 
any particular period.
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity 
incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of 
Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period 
independent of the financial and operating performance of Datadog’s business.
Amortization of issuance costs. In May 2020, Datadog issued $747.5M of convertible senior notes due 2025, which bear 
interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%. Debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt 
instrument, are amortized as interest expense over the term. The expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs is a

non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense will provide for a more useful comparison of our 
operational performance in different periods.
Additionally, Datadog’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to 
investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the strength 
of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. 
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capital expenditures and capitalized 
software development costs, if any. The reduction of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized for software 
development facilitates comparisons of Datadog's liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that 
management does not consider to be indicative of our liquidity.
Operating Metrics
Datadog’s number of customers with ARR of $100,000 or more and number of customers with ARR of $1 million or more 
are based on the ARR of each customer, as of the last month of the quarter. 
We define the number of customers as the number of accounts with a unique account identifier for which we have an 
active subscription in the period indicated. Users of our free trials or tier are not included in our customer count. A single 
organization with multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries is generally counted as a single customer. However, in some 
cases where they have separate billing terms, we may count separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries as multiple 
customers.
We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We 
calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, and multiplying it by 12. MRR for each month is 
calculated by aggregating, for all customers during that month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts, 
additional usage, usage from subscriptions for a committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as used, and 
monthly subscriptions. We updated the definition of MRR as of the quarter ended September 30, 2021 to capture usage 
from subscriptions with committed contractual amounts and applied this change retrospectively. ARR and MRR should be 
viewed independently of revenue, and do not represent our revenue under GAAP on a monthly or annualized basis, as 
they are operating metrics that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR and MRR are not 
intended to be replacements or forecasts of revenue.
A further indication of the propensity of our customer relationships to expand over time is our dollar-based net retention 
rate, which compares our ARR from the same set of customers in one period, relative to the year-ago period. We calculate 
dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 
months prior to such period-end, or the Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of 
the current period-end, or the Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction 
or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total 
Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then 
calculate the weighted average of the trailing 12-month point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates, to arrive at the 
dollar-based net retention rate.

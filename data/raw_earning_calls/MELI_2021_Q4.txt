Hello everyone. Thanks for joining our earnings announcements this past quarter and the full year 2021.
Last year presented us with challenges, and with those also came many more opportunities. With our teams’ 
resilience and focus on delivering on our strategic objectives, we have been able to overcome shifting 
pandemic lockdown measures, rising inflationary cost pressures and a highly competitive environment in the 
digital commerce space. The final outcome was a year with record results across the board, sustained strong 
growth in key business metrics and topline, and improving margins and operating income for a second 
consecutive year.
In commerce, we had another very strong year, reaching $28.4 billion dollars in gross merchandise volume, 
a full-year growth of over 48% in GMV on an FX-neutral basis. This represents an additional $7.4 billion 
dollars over 2020’s GMV, positioning us well ahead of our competitors in market share in the region for yet 
another year. More importantly, we saw a sustained shift in consumer behavior on our platform. Customer 
loyalty and retention are improving consistently and our clients are buying more with us - on average items 
per buyer were up by 17% on a year-over-year basis, growing over a strong 2020 baseline. Even with the 
reopening of physical stores, customers in Latin America have embraced shopping online, paving the way 
for further long-term growth in our region.
We attribute this growing engagement and improving cohort behavior to our free shipping program (that 
delivers over 80% of GMV on our network at no cost to our buyers), continuous improvements in delivery 
speed, a robust buyer protection program and customer service, an enhanced loyalty program, and our 
increasingly wide assortment of products sold on our marketplace as we push into new categories. All this, 
in turn, has resulted in more than two-thirds of our GMV coming from organic, non-paid traffic, mostly 
through our app, cementing our position as a pull rather than push business.

In fintech, growth comes from both our established strength in the payments business and, increasingly, 
from our newer, consumer-facing financial services businesses. 
Total Unique Fintech Active Users topped 51 million annually, with transactions per unique fintech active 
user also increasing steadily throughout the year, as our product suite became more comprehensive. 
Originations on our credit book surpassed $3.8 billion dollars this year, as we improved our credit 
underwriting capabilities. The Credits business has become a central piece of our ecosystem, enabling 
merchants to invest in more inventory and working capital, and consumers to finance their consumption 
needs in all of their touchpoints with our platforms. 
We also distributed over one million insurance policies during the year, and began rapidly expanding the 
portfolio of savings and investments products available to our users towards the latter half of the year with 
the launch of our crypto wallet in Brazil.
Our payments business delivered consistent growth in 2021. Total Payment Volume reached $77.4 billion 
dollars for the full year, growing 78% on an FX-neutral basis. Considering just the off-platform TPV, we 
reached over $48 billion dollars, an FX-neutral growth of 97% year-over-year. We continue to onboard more 
merchants into our ecosystem, doubling the number of off-platform merchants year-over-year, reaching over 
20 million unique payment collectors in 2021. We sold over 4.7 million MPOS devices this year, and are 
expanding greatly in Brazil and Argentina, while making important strides in Mexico, and we also launched 
the MPOS business in Chile at year's end.
Regarding our financial model, we are increasingly focused on efficiencies and operational leverage across 
our expenses and cost bases, while continuing to invest appropriately in our long-term growth to maintain 
our competitive leadership. Our desired outcome is to construct a financial model that can gain overall market 
share while growing our profits. 
During 2021, net revenues grew by 78% year-over-year, reaching $7.1 billion dollars on a consolidated basis. 
The revenue expansion was coupled with margin expansion at the EBIT level, improving by 300 basis points 
year over year, reaching a 6.2% EBIT margin in 2021, up from 3.2% in 2020 and -6.7% loss in 2019. Our 
EBIT dollars reached $441 million dollars in 2021, which translates to over $313 million in incremental EBIT 
dollars compared to 2020, and $594 million dollars compared to 2019. While there may be oscillations 
between quarters to accommodate for seasonality and product launches, we aim to deliver consistently 
growing profits over time, on a full-year basis. 
With that broader overview of the year, let’s now jump into a deeper review of our fourth quarter results, 
starting with the commerce business.
During the fourth quarter, Gross Merchandise Volume reached almost $8.0 billion dollars, growing 32% on
an FX-neutral basis, despite the challenging comps. Our 2-year CAGR trend on an FX-neutral basis was 
relatively stable compared to the prior quarter, with a 71% growth in Q4 compared to the 74% growth in 
the prior quarters of the year. 
Our unique buyer base continues to grow year-over-year and sequentially, with 40.5 million unique buyers 
on our marketplace in the fourth quarter. Not only are we expanding our user base, but we are also increasing 
the number of purchases per unique buyer. In Q4, items per buyer grew by 14% year-over-year, and are 
now over 50% higher than pre-pandemic rates. The higher engagement levels throughout the year were 
sustained across all of our key geographies. 
The improvements in buyer experience are also linked to our relationships with sellers on the platform as we 
continue to increase assortment and improve the quality of our merchant base. We had close to 300 million 
live listings in Q4, and our seller base is diverse - sales from official stores represented over 23% of GMV in 
the fourth quarter and the remainder comes from an array of mid and long tail sellers. For the promotional

season, we also ramped up our first-party assortment, reaching almost 5% of our total gross merchandise 
volume in the quarter.
This promotional season was also marked by improvements in the logistics network. In the fourth quarter, 
we shipped over 275 million items, while decreasing our average delivery times and simultaneously lowering 
average shipping costs per order. Almost 90% of all our volumes were delivered through our managed 
logistics network, compared to a 77% penetration level in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The evolution of efficiencies in delivery times has also been significant. In the fourth quarter, almost 80% of 
the volume was delivered within 48 hours, and close to 60% of the volume was delivered within the same 
or next day of when the purchase was made. Particularly for the items within our fulfillment centers, average 
delivery times are less than 24 hours. Volumes in fulfillment increased sequentially in Brazil, Mexico, Chile 
and Colombia this quarter. We are now able to handle heavy and bulky items within our fulfillment network, 
unlocking our potential to execute better service levels in consumer electronic categories like home 
appliances and white goods. Our continuous improvements in the productivity of our fulfillment centers have 
enabled us to deliver cost efficiencies during the peak shopping season compared to last year, and therefore 
we are encouraged to keep scaling our warehousing operations. 
Moreover, we continue to invest in additional capabilities and efficiencies for our cross-docking network. 
MELI Places, our network of pick-up and drop-off points, have been leveraged to provide more services to 
our customers. 90% of our Places are enabled for both package pick-up and drop-off, and we have already 
started the technology roll-out to receive returns from buyers through MELI Places. Our MELI Places network 
spans Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.
The reliability of our shipping solution has become a key driver of our net promoter scores, and we continue 
to believe that shipping is a key lever to drive higher e-commerce penetration in Latin America. As a result, 
we remain committed to decreasing delivery times and offering a wide variety of services to a larger range 
of customers across the region.
Let’s now turn to the fintech business, starting with a review of our Credit portfolio performance. We are 
very pleased to see that our credit book continues to grow, as we expand our credit offering to a broader 
group of users, without signs of behavior shifts in loan default rates. 
We closed the fourth quarter with a credit book of almost $1.7 billion dollars, and originated close to $1.5 
billion this quarter. Over 65% of these originations were consumer credit loans. In consumer credits, we saw 
for the second quarter in a row originations in the MercadoPago app outpacing originations in the Marketplace 
app, especially driven by personal loans. We finished the quarter with 7.4 million consumers with an active 
loan, and we have been consistently growing the base of pre-scored users with an active credit offer. This 
growth is driven by the strong combination of more user data from interactions with our ecosystem being 
fed directly into our risk and pricing models, and continuous improvement in our technology and models. 
Looking into the future, we are excited about the role the credit business plays in our ecosystem. Growth 
will remain spurred on by increasing the knowledge we have on merchants and consumers and our continued 
access to several proprietary distribution channels to offer credit. We have developed an attractive and 
resilient business model that allows us to grow sustainably and adapt quickly when uncertain circumstances 
arise. 
We are managing the default risk levels in our credit book very closely, and observed sequential 
improvements in non-performing loans during the fourth quarter. Total non-performing loans as a percentage 
of our outstanding portfolio have improved from 28% in the third quarter to 24%, and the allowance for 
uncollectibles has also reduced relative to the size of the portfolio, sequentially. 
Our funding strategy has also evolved as the portfolio matured over time, having ended 2020 with 20% 
being funded through external securitization, and now closing 2021 with 45%.

Other financial services beyond credit are also presenting important growth. We reached 34.5 million unique 
active fintech users in the fourth quarter, growing 23% versus the previous year, and the new product 
launches are boosting engagement levels for these users. We had 22.3 million investment accounts in Q4, 
an additional 7.4M compared to the same period in 2020. Users have also increased payment transactions 
for utilities and in peer-to-peer transfers using the wallet in our key geographies.
Digital Account TPV, which includes these wallet payments as well as card payments, reached $7.1 billion 
dollars, growing 138% in the fourth quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Within insurtech, we launched the 
distribution of insurance for card and PIX payments in Brazil, expanding on our insurance product offering. 
Our goal is to keep adding to these services such that the digital account becomes a more integrated offering, 
making it a seamless experience for individuals to concentrate their financial lives with us. 
Among the most recent launches is the trading function for cryptocurrencies. Within the digital account, all 
users in Brazil can now buy, hold and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and the USDP stable coin. Our cryptocurrency 
custodian partner will provide the blockchain infrastructure platform while we act as the distribution channel 
and user interface. Consistent with our other products, the crypto trading interface is very user-friendly, 
simple to navigate, secure and inclusive, with a minimum investment value of only 1 Brazilian real. It is still 
early on in our crypto journey, but we are encouraged with the uptake we are seeing in the number of 
Brazilian users transacting with crypto in our wallet. 
Finally, I would like to go over some of the highlights for our payments processing and acquiring business. 
Acquiring TPV grew 51% in the fourth quarter on an FX-neutral basis, reaching $17.2 billion dollars. Onplatform and off-platform online merchants accelerated payment volume growth in the fourth quarter, 
surpassing 32% and 54% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. The off-platform online payments are 
particularly improving in Brazil and Argentina, where we are adding more new merchants to our base. In 
Brazil, the addition of PIX as a payment checkout option online is also gaining traction. 
Our offline payment solutions with the QR network and MPOS devices are growing steadily and the crosssell opportunity for payment services is starting to come to fruition. The QR network continued to post tripledigit growth rates for TPV in Argentina, where we have our most mature QR network. And we are happy to 
see that we have been able to accelerate our expansion of the QR merchant base in Brazil and Mexico in the 
last few quarters. In Brazil, new active QR merchants are soaring as we leverage the PIX rails to introduce 
the QR network to long tail sellers. Furthermore, within SMBs, we have stepped up our go-to-market strategy 
and improved our capacity to convert MPOS device merchants to also use QR, and vice-versa. 
We also achieved some exciting milestones in the MPOS business in the fourth quarter, which grew 69% in 
TPV on an FX-neutral basis. We sold over 1.3 million devices across our core markets, a record sales mark 
for us. In addition, we made an important acquisition in the Chilean market by adding Redelcom, a payment 
service provider, to our ecosystem, allowing us to accelerate our expansion of financial services for local 
SMBs and micro-merchants in Chile. We are encouraged by the initial growth potential that we have seen as 
we ramp up our payment services in these new markets and transition SMBs into digital financial solutions. 
With that, let’s review the financial results for the quarter. 
In terms of net revenues, we delivered a record $2.1 billion dollars on a consolidated basis; a growth rate of 
61% in US dollars and of almost 74% on an FX-neutral basis for the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Strong revenue growth, on top of a record in absolute dollars, was achieved despite headwinds in Fintech 
monetization.
Our Fintech take rates over the total payment volume have been pressured by increases in interest rates, 
mainly in Brazil. This spread compression effect on take rate is about 10 basis points year-over-year. We 
recently announced a new pricing structure for our financing fees, starting in 2022, to contemplate new 
interest rate levels and begin offsetting these pressured financing revenues and the subsequent impact to

profitability.
On the other hand, we had a strong year-over-year improvement in take rates over gross merchandise 
volume in our commerce business, as well as a higher penetration of first-party sales, both of which are 
boosting our commerce revenues across all key geographies. 
Even more relevant than these two offsetting monetization trends, is the increasingly positive impact on take 
rate coming from the Credit business. Credit revenues reached almost $300 million dollars during the fourth 
quarter alone, triple the value of the previous year. 
In the fourth quarter, our gross profit reached $853 million dollars at a margin of 40%, a 320-basis point 
improvement compared to the 36.8% in Q4 of 2020. Our shipping operations were more efficient this quarter 
compared to last year, and we were able to further scale other costs associated with customer service, fraud 
prevention and collection fees for processing payments. 
Consolidated operating expenses represented 38.9% of revenues this quarter, similar to the 38.7% in the 
fourth quarter in 2020, albeit with a different mix, and more importantly with solid operational leverage 
across key expenses. 
General and Administrative expenses were $148 million dollars, or 6.9% of revenues, down from 8.7% in 
the fourth quarter of 2020.
Product Development expenses were almost $180 million dollars, or 8.4% of revenues compared to 8.8% 
last year. We have scaled across our investments in product development, even while onboarding four 
thousand additional software developers and data engineers to our employee base this year. 
Within Sales and Marketing, the 23.6% spending as a percentage of revenues, up from 21.3% last year is 
explained by increasing bad debt allowance. Our Credit book’s bad debt provisions, which are booked under 
Sales and Marketing expenses, have increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year due to our 
expanding Credit origination. While this does add pressure to an otherwise scaling expense line, the 
incremental revenues from the Credit business more than offset the bad debt charge when looking at impact 
on dollar earnings. Other S&M investments in marketing activities such as branding, customer acquisition, 
buyer protection program and other incentives are showing operational leverage of 170 basis points as a 
percentage of total revenues compared to 2020.
Consequently, our fourth quarter EBIT was $23.3 million dollars, at a margin of 1.1%, an improvement 
compared to the negative 1.9% of the EBIT loss we had in Q4 of last year. 
In the fourth quarter, our interest income was positively impacted by the higher interest rates, reaching $53 
million dollars and more than doubling compared to last year. Similarly, Interest expenses were $54 million 
dollars, offsetting the capital gains from interest income. 
We also had a foreign exchange loss of almost $57 million dollars in the quarter mainly due to the difference 
of Argentine official exchange rate and the blue-chip swap rate at which we effectively repatriated the 
retained earnings of the Argentine subsidiary. 
The resulting net loss after income tax in the quarter was $46 million dollars, at a negative 2.2% margin 
over net revenues, which is an important improvement compared to last year of -3.8%
As I noted previously, we are closing 2021 with several important achievements in terms of growth, and our 
ability to deliver consistent improvements at the EBIT margin level for the full year marks our long term 
commitment toward growth with sustained operating leverage and increasing earnings.

To conclude, we would like to reiterate that there remains a huge runway of opportunities ahead of us. Even 
after the significant uptake in digital services we experienced over the last couple of years, e-commerce 
penetration in our region is still only at the 10% range. In the same light, even with all of the recent advances 
in the financial technology space in Latin America, we still live in a context where most people have difficulty 
accessing credit, savings and insurance products, and controlling their finances. This emboldens us to remain 
committed to our mission to democratize access to commerce and financial services in our region. There is 
still a lot to build, and we trust that our continuous investments in technology and human capital will be 
determining factors in our future success. 
I am also happy to announce that we are releasing our annual impact report, simultaneous with our 10-K, 
allowing us to communicate with shareholders both our financial and non-financial objectives and 
performance. We believe this allows for a more cohesive understanding of our value creation capacity and 
its impact over time. We are also publishing our first sustainability bond report in connection with the 2026 
Sustainability Notes issued a year ago, with 15.5% of proceeds already allocated. Finally, we can now share 
an in-depth analysis of climate-related risk factors following the framework of the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures that we conducted during 2021 and will be deep-diving in upcoming years. We 
are proud of this integrated approach and are committed to improving upon it year on year, and encourage 
you to review the material to get a clear understanding of our sustainability programs and their impact.
Thank you again for joining us today to review our results. We are happy to take your questions and to 
connect with you within the next few weeks.

Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide 
useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the 
corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everybody. And a warm welcome to Jan, who many of you know, to what is his 
first Cognizant's earnings call. Today, I'd like to address four topics with you, namely a brief summary of the third 
quarter, an update on our employee engagement, observations on the demand environment and client's evolving 
needs, and our strategic focus areas, as we aim to revitalize revenue growth.
Let's start with the third quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year 
in constant currency. Excluding the negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain non-strategic content 
services business, revenue grew 60 basis points year-over-year.
We executed well in what remains a challenging environment. Highlights of the quarter include continued 
commercial momentum with bookings growth in excess of 25% year-over-year, ongoing momentum and digital 
with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year, and continued strength in digital bookings and qualified pipeline, 
gross margin and cash flow strength, enabling us to continually invest in the business, and significantly increased 
and sustained financial flexibility on India earnings and cash. Jan will provide more insights on the quarter in his 
prepared remarks.
Moving to our second topic, I would like to briefly address our talented associates. I'm grateful to each of them for 
their professionalism and perseverance in serving our clients during this protracted pandemic, which has put a 
tremendous strain on families and compressed their lives to screens and homes. We could not have executed 
against our commitments in 2020 without their client centricity, work ethic, and engagement.
Given our financial performance and in recognition of the contributions of our associates, [indiscernible] 
(00:03:33) 2020 bonuses at higher levels than 2019. We're also implementing targeted merit increases and 
promotions in the fourth quarter. Both will hurt our cost structure in 2020 versus the prior year, but are an 
essential and normalized part of the cost structure in a services business.
In stressful times like these, we are especially attentive to employee engagement, a measure of how committed 
and connected people are to our company. A recent Cognizant people engagement survey showed scores 
consistently above industry benchmarks, and our overall engagement score meaningfully increased versus prior 
surveys. In an external endorsement of sorts, Forbes magazine just ranked Cognizant number 19 out of 750 
companies across 45 countries in its World's Best Employers list.
These high levels of employee engagement, coupled with the current economic environment, contributed to our 
fifth consecutive quarter of reductions and voluntary attrition. We anticipate some sequential increases in 
voluntary attrition in the coming quarters, after the forthcoming merit-based promotions and salary increase cycle. 
We continued to prioritize the health and safety of all our associates, and remained in a work-from-home and 
restricted travel posture, with only limited exceptions.
Now, I'd like to turn to clients, and in particular, the trends that we're seeing. These trends fall into two categories: 
one cyclical and one secular. First, on the cyclical side, and set against a protracted pandemic, clients are

increasingly decisive on their technology priorities. They're focused on cost savings, CapEx reductions, resiliency, 
and agility.
This is slowing large project deployments with extended paybacks, thus creating other opportunities. We are 
seeing accelerated vendor consolidation trends, which we stand to benefit from given our deep strategic 
relationships and client references in build-operate and/or enhance portfolio and growing reputation in digital, 
where more and more clients want to see us challenge digital incumbents.
Client focus on innovation and cost savings is also creating opportunities for incumbent vendor displacement and 
larger deals. We plan to be disciplined and selective in our pursuit of larger deals, including captives, as these 
transactions, if not well-conceived, can bring dilutive compound annual growth rates, margin pressure, and 
unfavorable terms.
I want to focus my comments on the more consequential secular trends, digital transformation. This is our top 
priority. It goes to the heart of client's business model innovation, transformation, and experiences. COVID-19 has 
widened the digital divide between the digital natives and legacy economy companies, which have struggled to 
shift to a fully digital operating model.
These industrial era companies have focused on upgrading their tech stack at the infrastructure, data and 
application layers. They've migrated their apps and data to the cloud, and improved the agility of their underlying 
technology. These improvements, however important, fall short of delivering the full power of digital 
transformation as they optimize the technology foundation rather than the business process or operating model. I 
believe the industry is at an inflection point in digital adoption.
We see growing clients' interest in realizing more immediate customer and business value by identifying use 
cases to shift to agile digital workflows. That means transforming processes to become agile, data-driven, and 
automated. Such workflows can be industry-specific, such as claims and policy management, or 
pharmacovigilance, or horizontal, such as quote-to-cash or digital marketing.
One such case is how we engineered an agile digital workflow for a leading apparel company that needed to 
return to work and to store strategy. We offered our safe workforce solution built on the Salesforce, Work.com 
platform. This comprehensive employee safety solution provides management with information about public 
health conditions, office capacity, employee health, and shift schedules. It can stagger arrival times to minimize 
contact, encourage hygiene through automated reminders, and when connected with IoT sensors, help enforce 
social distancing and occupancy limits.
As more clients implement agile digital workflows, the digital services market is evolving into a third phase. In 
Phase 1 of digital, clients sought to understand what digital really meant to their industry. In Phase 2, they 
implemented digital experiments and projects at the edge of their enterprises. In Phase 3, clients realized they 
must be software-driven enterprises, and digital to their core.
So, what does this shift to agile digital workflows mean for services companies, and who will be the winners? The 
first and perhaps most obvious thing to say is that there will be more than one winner. That being said, everything 
we are doing as a company, from our strategy, solution portfolio, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, branding 
and marketing, and talent is focused on being one of the biggest beneficiaries of this new phase in digital.
To become modern businesses and create business value, companies need to embrace a digital technology 
stack that consists of personalized and engaging customer and employee experiences, enabled by software

engineering, powered by customer and operational intelligence, driven by data, and run on a modern cloud 
business platform. We haven't always done a great job marketing this, but we are one of the few firms in the world 
with solutions and partnerships across every layer of this stack.
Inorganic investments have strengthened our SaaS partnerships with both Salesforce and Workday 
complementing longstanding relationships with SAP, Oracle and ServiceNow to offer clients the full suite of 
enterprise application services they require to modernize their core processes, and enable agile digital workflows.
In the last six months, we've further strengthened our partnership commitment to all three leading hyperscale 
providers, announcing the formation of dedicated business groups for both Microsoft and AWS, and investing to 
enhance our Google Cloud credentials. Whatever approach a client wants to take to become a modern business, 
our portfolio allows [ph] multiple unwraps (00:10:27).
Let's say a client wants to start at the bottom of the digital technology stack by accelerating cloud migration. We 
can do this for them, driving efficiencies that can subsequently be invested in innovation. That's exactly what 
we're doing for a global automotive manufacturer that came to us for help to bring agility, innovation and efficiency 
to their business processes. We started by executing an agile delivery model for core modernization. We then 
deployed our one DevOps model across the clients' dealers, supply chain, accessories, parts and incentives, 
improving speed, flexibility and user experience.
In another example, we're engaged in partnership with Snowflake in a digital transformation project for a leading 
financial services firm. We're building a cloud-based intelligent data platform that facilitates multiple analytical and 
machine-based use cases. This platform unlocks innovation opportunities and value-added use cases, including 
real-time intelligence for fraud detection, a better user experience for opening and reactivating accounts, a 
reduction in loads as pre-processing time and improved field agent selling effectiveness.
More and more clients are however starting at the top of the digital technology stack by focusing on their 
customer and employee experience. Such experiences can be continuously improved through the magic of 
human-centric insights, software product engineering, automation and applied AI, and hyper-personalization, all of 
which ultimately requires clients to embark on a core and data modernization journey.
That's what we did for a large global insurance company that selected Cognizant to design, implement and run a 
new direct-to-consumer business that will provide a compelling AI-enabled interactive experience to consumers 
and agents. Recognizing this needed to be integrated with existing core systems and data architectures, we then 
work with AWS to host this in a scalable modern digital platform.
In these examples, you will see the opportunity to create a flywheel effect, a virtuous cycle, which Cognizant and 
our clients stand well-positioned to benefit from. In a world of vendor consolidation, Cognizant is one of the few 
firms that can capture this opportunity.
I'd now like to turn to the company's future and our goal to increase our relative commercial momentum and 
revitalized revenue growth. In a knowledge-based business, investing for growth starts with attracting, developing 
and retaining talent. In the last six months, we have overhauled our talent management and annual performance 
evaluation processes, which allow us to develop a diverse, inclusive and high performance team where talent is 
identified and nurtured for promotions.
Meanwhile, we have invested in growth by strengthening our country leadership with senior hires in Germany, the 
Nordics, Australia, and Asia Pacific Japan. Earlier this week, we also announced the completion of our Executive

Committee with the announcement of our new President for Global Growth Markets, and the newly created role of 
Executive Vice President and Chairman for Cognizant India.
We've also rallied the organization behind what we call the Cognizant Agenda, which articulates our purpose, 
vision and values. Our vision is to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite. 
To achieve this, we are aligned behind a series of bold moves that require investments.
First, we will meaningfully increase investments in branding and marketing, including launching a breakthrough 
global brand campaign in the coming months. This campaign will reposition the Cognizant brand, and will reach 
beyond our familiar technology audience to the entire C-suite as well as the next generation of talent.
Second, we will continue to accelerate digital. Our priority areas of digital engineering, AI and analytics, cloud and 
IoT are more relevant than ever to clients. We aim to lead in the third phase of digital, which will require continued 
investment in M&A, our commercial and delivery capabilities, offer management, talent and branding.
Third, we will continue to globalize Cognizant by investing for growth in targeted countries, strengthening our 
regional capabilities, scaling our brand internationally, and executing a global delivery network that will ensure 
greater resiliency in our delivery capabilities.
And fourth, we will continue to make investments that increase our relevance to clients by strengthening our 
industry expertise and technology consulting capabilities, investing in our talent and extending our solution 
integrator and designer competency.
As we invest for growth, we will also continue to leverage our balance sheet to accelerate our strategy. Our M&A 
strategy, continues to be focused on advancing our digital priorities across the globe. Last month, we closed the 
acquisition of Tin Roof Software, a custom software and digital product development services company that 
expands our software product engineering footprint in the United States. And earlier this month, we closed the 
acquisition of 10th Magnitude, one of Microsoft's longest-standing Azure-centric partners. This deal expands the
Microsoft Azure expertise within our new Microsoft business group, and adds development on managed services 
hubs throughout the United States. And last week, we agreed to acquire Bright Wolf, a technology services 
provider that specializes in custom industrial IoT solutions for Fortune 1000 companies, which will expand our 
smart products and Industry 4.0 expertise.
In short, we are committed to growth, and we'll continue to make meaningful investments to ensure we increase 
our relevance to clients, and enhance our competitiveness. While the macro and political backdrop remain 
uncertain, come what may, our goal is to ensure we outgrow the market, just like we did in the third quarter, whilst 
remaining commercially disciplined.
In closing, I would remind you that 18 months ago, when we set Cognizant's transformation in motion aimed at 
returning the company to be the IT services industry bellwether, we knew this would be a multiyear endeavor, and 
our view has not changed.
While we continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, we are encouraged by our progress. Our employees are 
energized and united by our shared purpose and vision. We're excited about our strengthening competitive 
position, the opportunity to expand internationally, and the opportunity presented by the third phase of digital. 
There will be several big winners in this attractive market, and we aim to be one of them.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the details of the third quarter and our fiscal year 
outlook, before we take your questions. Jan, over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very happy to be part of the Cognizant team, and look 
forward to connecting with all of you going forward. From the onset, I was intrigued by Cognizant's meaningful 
growth opportunity, and my first weeks in the job have more than confirmed my initial assessment. I will work hard 
to fill Karen's shoes, and wanted to say a big thank you to her for making my onboard so smooth and seamless.
Moving on to Q3 results. Third quarter revenue of $4.2 billion was flat year-over-year or a decline of 70 basis 
points at constant currency. Compared to the prior-year period, this includes a positive 250 basis points' 
contribution from inorganic growth, and a negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain content-related 
services. Sequentially, we saw a broad-based improvement in the business, particularly in areas such as cloud 
and enterprise application services, IoT, and software engineering.
Moving to the industry verticals, where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. 
Financial Services declined 2.2%, with similar performance in both banking and insurance. Retail banking 
improved in the quarter, driven by regional banks, while capital markets returned to growth after several quarters 
of softness. However, we continued to see weakness across global banking accounts, and with clients in the 
payment sector. We continue to expect below company average performance in the Financial Services segment 
for the next several quarters.
Healthcare grew 4.2%, led by double-digit growth in life sciences, driven by strong growth in the biopharma 
clients, and included the contribution of the Zenith acquisition, which we lapped mid-quarter. Growth was partially 
offset by continued weakness in the medical device clients. Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue saw a modest 
growth. After six quarters of decline, we are pleased with early signs of improvements in the Healthcare business. 
We see improvement in the payer segment across key accounts, which is offsetting the decline in the provider 
market that continues to be negatively impacted by COVID.
Products and Resources declined 4.6%, with double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, 
offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality, and high-single-digit declines in retail and consumer 
goods. While we saw strength in bookings in retail and consumer goods, we expect continued pressure in 2021 
as a result of the ongoing pandemic.
Communications, Media and Technology was flat, including the approximately negative $57 million year-over-year 
impact to technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Excluding this 
negative 920-basis-point impact, growth in Communications, Media and Technology was approximately 9%. 
Communications and media grew mid-single digits as growth in communications and education clients offset 
continued weakness in media and entertainment. We expect pressure in media and entertainment into 2021.
While overall, we saw improved momentum across the business, the demand environment remains uncertain. But 
we believe, we are gaining traction across industries as reflected in the strong bookings and pipeline numbers, 
Brian referenced earlier.
Moving on to margins. IN Q3, our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 14.2% and $0.64, respectively. 
GAAP EPS reflects $140 million or $0.26 per share income tax expense related to the reversal of our indefinite

reinvestment assertion on accumulated Indian earnings. I'll comment more on that decision later in my prepared 
remarks.
Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.9%, and our 
adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97. Adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points year-over-year, primarily 
driven by higher incentive-based compensation and the dilutive impact of our recently completed acquisitions, 
which more than offset savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E expense, and the favorable 
movement in the rupee.
Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred $43 million of charges related to the Fit for Growth Plan. The actions 
drove continued cost discipline, which allowed us to further invest into our growth initiatives. The majority of the 
actions under Fit for Growth are complete, and we have achieved our savings targets. We expect charges to be 
approximately $200 million, and annualized gross run-rate savings of $520 million to $550 million in 2021.
While we don't anticipate charges under Fit for Growth to continue in 2021, we will continue to invest savings 
achieved to help accelerated growth aligned behind the four strategic areas Brian outlined: repositioning the 
Cognizant brand, accelerating digital, globalizing the company, increasing our relevance with clients.
Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of September 30 stood at 
$4.6 billion or a net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net debt balances include the approximate $1.7 billion 
drawn on our revolving credit facilities in the first quarter 2020. We had a strong cash flow quarter generating 
$821 million of free cash flow, largely driven by improved collections of our receivables. DSO improved by 5 days 
year-over-year to 72 days.
Before turning to guidance, I will provide additional details on our decision to reverse our indefinite reinvestment 
assertion on accumulated India earnings totaling $5.2 billion. The decision was made based on our strategic 
priorities to accelerate growth in international markets, and to expand our global delivery footprint, changes to the 
India budget enacted in April, and changes to the US tax regulations that became effective in September. This 
reversal resulted in a onetime GAAP-only tax cost of approximately $140 million, and makes those earnings 
available globally.
In October, we distributed $2.1 billion from our subsidiary in India, which resulted in a net $2 billion cash transfer 
from India after payment of India withholding tax. Importantly, on a go-forward basis, we can now more efficiently 
utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, which gives us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program.
While we are reviewing our capital allocation program, we initiated our share repurchase program and intend to 
repay our credit facilities by the end of this month. The share repurchase activity will offset a portion of the EPS 
impact from the lost interest income historically generated from cash balances held in India.
While interest rates in India have steadily declined in the last several quarters, year-to-date, that cash had earned 
roughly 5%. This generated approximately $95 million of interest income or $0.13 per share. Since September, 
we have deployed over $700 million on share buybacks, repurchasing approximately 10 million shares.
Now, turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and the pace of recovery 
complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. While we are pleased with the solid bookings 
and pipeline of the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely be impacted by the 
pace of economic recovery, and thus, clients' confidence and spend. We are reaffirming revenue guidance at the 
high-end of our previously guided range.

Specifically, for the full-year 2020, we expect revenue to decline approximately 0.4% year-over-year in constant 
currency. Based on current exchange rate, this translates to a decline of 0.5% up to approximately $16.7 billion 
on a reported basis. Our revenue guidance includes our estimate of the negative impact of approximately 110 
basis points to the full-year revenue from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business 
that will be reflected in our CMT segment, and a positive contribution of approximately 200 basis points from 
closed acquisitions. This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Financial Services, and the retail and 
consumer goods, and travel and hospitality portions of our Products and Resources segment.
For the full-year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 15%, which assumes 
incremental costs associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for 
certain of our associates effective October 1, and incentive compensation above 2019 levels.
Our current guidance also assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and 
a typical cycle of furloughs. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.63 to $3.67. Please see 
the non-GAAP reconciliations in the Form 8-K we filed today for a full definition.
This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 541 million shares, and GAAP tax rate of 
approximately 32%, which implies a Q4 tax rate of approximately 27%. Our guidance does not account for any 
potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies.
With that, operator, we can open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first 
question today is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now live.

Jason Kupferberg
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe I'll just ask two quick ones upfront in 
the interest of time. First off, in light of what's happened recently with SAP, we've been getting a lot of questions 
just around the size of the practice that you guys may still have in that area. So, any sizing you can give us there 
would be helpful.
And then, can you just comment on – with the digital bookings growth being strong as it has been, I think you're 
up 40% year-to-date. When does that start translating to faster digital revenue growth? I know we've been 
hovering in kind of the almost the mid-teens range here the last couple of quarters.
And then that kind of dovetails with a related question of, do you think revenue growth could actually turn positive 
in Q1. I know previously, you said that we may still see negative growth through the first quarter of next year, but 
obviously, you're on a better trajectory now. Thank you.

Hey, Jason, it's Brian. So, let me take a shot at some of these. But Jan, by all means feel free to jump in if you've 
incremental details to add. So, SAP as a practice, it's multiple 100 millions of dollars for us, it's sub-$1 billion. It is 
actually a very healthy business for us.
And I have been in touch with the SAP leadership team in recent periods to see what we can do to accelerate our 
momentum there. It's pretty intuitive what they're doing. But in the same way, it's also interesting for us given our 
ambition to scale much more internationally and given the installed base of SAP. So, it's a partner that really is 
strategic to us, and we will continue to work closely with.
Digital bookings, look, more broadly, if I stand back from this, bookings are strong overall, and it's broad based by 
geography, by industry, by new and expansion versus renewals and digital bookings are continuing to be strong 
as well. So, what's been very pleasing to me is in the course of the last year, we have consistently shown strong 
bookings growth year-over-year. That has enabled us to actually build a stronger backlog through the year. And 
now, we're in a very healthy position, healthier than we've been before. And of course, the pipeline, as Jan 
suggested earlier, is strong as well.
Not just strong overall, but also strong in digital, in particular, and strong in the strategic accounts that we focused 
on as part of our customer segmentation exercise in the RAD model. So, I feel really good about our momentum 
there. The timing of all of this to revenue can vary by quarter, of course, and in the face of economic environment, 
which is unsettled to say the very least, including announcements made tonight across Europe. But we're pleased 
with what we've done. And if this continues, it all bodes very well for our future.
We're not going to make commentary around Q1 or indeed, fiscal year 2021 at this moment in time. The only 
thing I'll say is we will continue to try to outgrow the industry. That's what we did this quarter. We think we're more 
competitive than we've been before. And we're absolutely committed to growing to make investments to grow. If
that means compromising some margins in the short term to achieve that, we will absolutely do that. But I'm 
expecting performance to improve in 2021, but we'll share more details of that, of course, in our Q4 earnings, but 
the big caveat around this is what we're going through at this moment in time, which is a very uncertain 
macroeconomic environment.

Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thanks, guys, and congratulations. All right. So, the election inevitably causes and triggers some 
discussions and questions related to H1B visas and L1 visas. Can you just remind us what fraction of Cognizant's 
US labor force is currently on visas? What's, sort of, your level of dependence and focus is on that program, and 
maybe kind of a little bit of the movie of how your labor force structure has evolved over the last few years, and 
how that's evolving going forward? Maybe I'll just dovetail that into my other kind of observation was just that you 
actually had head count increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter, and that utilization is way up, attrition is way 
down. Are you kind of at where you want to be with your labor force at this point going forward? Thank you.

Hi, Lisa, Brian here. So, let's start first with the APAC situation. I think our utilization levels are now quite high. We 
tightened our belt earlier in the year as I think every company in the world did, but we've seen somewhat of a Vshaped recovery, particularly in the digital side of our business. And as such, we're at the stage now that our

bench is light, and we're committed as a leadership team to build that out. And we've already started that over the 
last month or so. But it takes time, of course, to get that built out. Obviously, we want to continue to drive more 
operational rigor around forecasting, which triggers enterprise resource management and all of that to make sure 
we have the right resources in the right place at the right time. So, you will see us continue to build out our 
capabilities with evergreen skills or hot skills, as we would call them, and build upon our capabilities such that we 
can reduce utilization, which is a little bit higher at this moment in time.
I am pleased with the employee engagement. I am pleased that voluntary attrition is down for the fifth quarter in a 
row. Notwithstanding that, we're really pushing meritocracy and a performance culture these days. So, you have 
seen a big bifurcation between voluntary versus involuntary attrition. And we do expect voluntary attrition to pick 
up a little bit in the coming quarters as we go through a merit-based promotion and salary cycle we're going 
through. And I underscore the word merit-based.
With regards to H1B visas, look, it's quite topical, but perhaps I could stand back here a little bit and talk because 
the administrative rule changes with regards to skilled immigration visas that have been quite topical in recent 
weeks. Some of those have been enjoying through litigation already, and for other elements, there're challenges 
pending at this moment in time. So, whether the rules survive or not remains to be seen. All that being said, I 
actually think all roads are leading in this direction anyway, so we will always intend to comply with the letter of 
the law to use these applications, and any extensions we intend to pursue.
We are a H1B visa, I would say, dependent organization. You used the word evolution, and I think that's the right 
word. Over the years, we have reduced our dependency in visas, and we've also acquired companies that enable 
us to be more global in nature.
But in the same vein, some of the strategic decisions we took, which were in the right decisions, including exiting 
a portion of content moderation, has put us back a little bit. That being said, the rule is solely triggered by new 
applications and extensions. And H1B visas are currently under the three-year visa. So, this will roll in gradually. 
And I would say, and I want to reassure everybody, our intention is to globalize Cognizant. And so, you'll see us 
build out much more of a global-based workforce to meet client expectations, whilst, of course, they focus on 
quality of delivery. And that will include a whole host of things that we will do, including US college campus 
recruiting, upskilling, and just a broader effort around our local employee base in the US and indeed globally.

Thank you. Hi, Brian. Welcome, Jan. Good to speak with you again. My question is on the Healthcare vertical, 
and it's good to see the improvement. Question is with regards to the sustainability of that and the investments 
that you're making in various healthcare capabilities, including, but not limited to TriZetto. And on the topic of 
TriZetto with the Atos settlement, was that included in the cash forecast that you have, what does it mean from an 
operational perspective in terms of your client relationships, if you could address those questions.

So, Jan, I'll touch on the Healthcare business, if you want to touch upon then the cash and cash flow and the cash 
balance and the Syntel settlement, which we were pleased to see yesterday. So, Ashwin, first of all, Healthcare is 
really important to us. It's almost 30% of the total company, and it consists of two major portions. One is life

sciences. We're doing really well there. We have been for a long time. It's highly strategic to us. You are seeing 
the lapping of Zenith technology, which happened in Q3 of 2020, so that will impact growth rates a little bit. But I'm 
very optimistic around the opportunities in life sciences at the intersection point of biopharma, medical devices, 
right through to Industry 4.0 healthcare, retail and indeed health tech. And I spent a number of hours on that with 
the team over the weekend. So, we're really pumped around what we can do there, and you will see us continue 
to invest in it. The majority of the business is, however, the US Healthcare business, which is split between payer 
and providers.
The payer business accelerated meaningfully this quarter, which strengthened services and indeed in products. 
We have a new leader, who took over the Healthcare business earlier this year, an internal promotion, who has 
done a fantastic job, and this entire team are doing great for us.
Bookings are very strong. Product growth is strong. We're getting new logos. Margins are improving. And we're 
just generally feeling very good, a better payer business. The provider business, which is much smaller than our 
payer business, saw significant erosion year-over-year in the third quarter as did the industry.
As you know, the provider business is suffering from transaction volumes that are decreasing because the 
pandemic is obviously reducing elective procedures. And I would say that's an area that we would expect to come 
back, but more holistically, the momentum we're seeing in payers, which is three-fourth of the business, and life 
sciences will give us confidence that we can continue to post strong Healthcare results going forward. We're 
improving.
Jan, over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jan Siegmund
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. Let me add a few comments to the Syntel lawsuit. You may have seen this morning that we won a jury 
verdict of $854 million. This lawsuit has a long history for Cognizant. And at the core is our claim that Syntel 
misappropriated TriZetto's intellectual property related to some software products during that time and while 
Syntel was a TriZetto subcontractor. And the jury verdict, which found no liability for TriZetto or Cognizant, 
basically speaks for itself. We're gratified with the results. But at Atos, the owner of Syntel, has already indicated 
that they're planning to appeal the verdict. So, it will be quite a bit out, I think, until we have the final results of this 
trial coming, too. So, way too early to take that cash into account for any actions. Nevertheless, I think it was 
satisfying to see to see the jury to side with Cognizant's position.
Relative to the cash repatriation, it might be worthwhile just spending an extra minute on it, too. So, we had about 
a cash balance in India of $2.1 billion. And we, at the end of September, reversed our indefinite reinvestment 
assertion, and decided to repatriate that cash from India. And as part of that decision, we could make that 
decision for two reasons. The most important one is strategically driven actually because we are executing well 
on our strategy to globalize the enterprise, and we'll continue to invest into international markets. And for that, 
capital will be needed.
But number two, also, the 2021 – fiscal year 2021 India budget enacted in April, and some changes in US tax 
regulations allowed us to remediate this cash on a cost-effective basis, and we did so actually in October. The 
cash balances in India historically have earned some interest on the cash balances – on the cash that we have 
there. And approximately, I think, as I said in the script, about 5%. And the – we're offsetting – we used some of 
the cash that we returned from India, and cash at hand to repurchase shares during the month of September and 
October. And the accretion created through the share buybacks was actually approximately offsetting the

contribution that our interest income would have generated in India. So, the outlook is quite balanced and is a 
starting point. And obviously, we're excited about the go-forward benefit of this transaction because we, going 
forward, have now full flexibility and full access to our free cash flow on a global basis.

Bryan C. Bergin
Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC Q
Hey. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just thinking about your largest verticals here. So, you've turned the corner on 
Healthcare. I wanted to ask on Financial Services. I hear the commentary on lower than average growth for the 
next few quarters. And I'm curious what you're seeing in the areas of the clients, and whether it's still limited to 
only a handful of the former large banking accounts. Really, how close are you to the end of the tunnel on 
stabilizing those? And what do you think you need to do in those areas to really turn the corner in Financial 
Services, too?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Hey, Bryan, so I would say, yeah, it remains challenged. Look, first of all, just like Healthcare, Financial Services 
saw the greatest impact from ransomware. But the Financial Services results I'd almost cut them into two portions 
of discussion. First of all, insurance, and as you know, the insurance industry has really been pressured, to say 
the very least in the last year, both at a pandemic level, insurance rebates, and automobiles, SMB businesses 
interrupted, and failures. That's impacting the property and casualty insurance industry, and of course, mortality 
rates and life carriers. And then on top of that to make matters worse, catastrophic events and low interest rates.
So, that sector is under pressure. Our business is, let's say, 80% of our insurance business is in North America, 
so a little bit more than the average in a company. It's one of our strongest franchises, but it will decline in – this 
year in 2020. So, we need to turn it around. We need to improve the pipeline, to be very honest. Bookings have 
been strong, but the pipeline isn't strong enough. Our leader has retired in the last month or so. So, we have 
some new energy in there. And hopefully, we can get that back on track.
Banking. Look, if I think the macro picture first; as we've implied in the prepared remarks, capital markets, retail 
and commercial banking grew year-over-year. Cards or payments were down. With regards to some of the larger 
global banking clients that you'd referenced, it's more of a handful. Some of that, to be very honest, relates to 
ransomware, we were turning some around. Some is self-inflicted wounds related to a lack of appropriate [ph] 
senior origin (00:45:54) in the client partners we had. And some of it relates to secular pressure towards 
insourcing that we're seeing in those banks.
Now, what did we do to turn all around this entire situation? I'm confident we'll get insurance back on track. I think 
we'll also continue to make progress in the North America regional banks. And we've even brought some 
accounts into platinum account status this quarter, i.e., they surpassed the $100 million. But in the same vein, we 
have a lot of work to do in our current accounts, and that includes scaling more into digital in those banks.
The good news is our digital bookings in those banks are up in excess of 50%. So, we are starting to get our foot 
in the door. We continue to upgrade our client partners, and we're continuing to try to do a much more 
sophisticated job in terms of account planning. In the same vein, right up to the executive committee, me

included, we are trying to break into some of the other large banks. And I think we're making progress actually on 
two in particular. So, hopefully, we'll have some good news on that in the foreseeable future.
Europe in banking just remains weak. We lost an account there in the last year, and we have some transformation 
project issues in one large account over there. It is fixable, but I just don't see the momentum turning around there 
as quickly in banking overall as I have seen in Healthcare.

Rod Bourgeois
Analyst, DeepDive Equity Research, LLC Q
Okay. Great. Hey. Nice progress by Cognizant in these results. I want to ask a high-level question. Recognizing 
that the COVID pandemic is continuing here, do you see Cognizant as still somewhat in a crisis response and 
basic blocking-and-tackling mode, or have you transitioned now into a more forward-moving strategic attack 
mode?
I guess, the main part of the question here is, assuming you are in a transition, what are the next set of metrics 
you're most focused on to gauge Cognizant's progress moving forward here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Thanks, Rod. Brian here. So, look, there's a short answer and there's a long answer, so I'm going to give you 
something in between. First of all, I really feel good about the progress we've made in the last 18 months. We've 
actually done a lot, probably more than people realize. Clarified our strategy. We executed the non-strategic 
portion of the business. We executed the restructuring program. We used some of the proceeds from that to 
reinvest back into the business. We meaningfully improved our digital portfolio competencies and partnerships.
We built a strong professional, mature, client-centric leadership team. We begun a pretty significant commercial 
transformation that is showing positive leading indicators and pipeline win rates, bookings. And we put, I would 
say, a better business management system in place to ensure optimal financial and operational rigor. And we did 
all of that, to be very honest, in a period that I was not expecting.
We managed through a global pandemic that impacted both demand as well as fulfillment. We navigated a 
ransomware attack well, and I want to say that humbly. But we did as best as we could, and we've actually 
received good client feedback on that. We've improved employee engagement to levels not seen for a few years, 
and have reduced voluntary attrition at five quarters in a row. And we've managed to put ourselves in a position 
that we built a multiyear plan that incorporates sustained investments.
So, I'd characterize all of that as pleased, but not satisfied, to be very honest. We're not a finished product yet. 
We're in the middle of a multiyear project. And we must continue to, of course, as we've said, reposition the 
brand, execute our strategy, globalize the company, take advantage of the opportunity overseas, globalize our 
delivery, build on our growing momentum in Healthcare and fix Financial Services and, of course, accelerate our 
position in digital, which just simply exposes us to higher categories of growth, and makes us more relevant to 
clients.

If we do all of this, our bookings momentum will continue, and ultimately, this will translate to revenue growth. And 
so, Rod, everything else at some stage becomes a leading indicator: pipeline, win rates, the leadership team, the 
bookings. Our goal here is to invest in the business to get back to growth. If we do that, growth accelerates and 
we will show margin expansion, but in a very calculated manner that allows us to sustainably reinvest back into 
the business. I say all of this with a great deal of caveats given the uncertain macroeconomic situation we're in at 
this moment in time.
That being said, I'll just wrap up by saying, I'm really proud of our team and of our associates around the world. 
I'm confident of the unity of our leadership team, the absolute support of our board of directors, who've been 
tremendously supportive of what we're doing, and our growing execution rigor. And honestly, I think we're on 
track. We're increasingly competitive. And you've seen that hopefully in this quarter's results.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is now live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
Hi, Brian. I wanted to actually try to get two in, and I'll ask them concurrently. The first is I wanted to return to 
bookings. And your bookings growth has been really strong. It sound like – it's 15% year-to-date, and it sounded 
like it was 25% for the quarter, so accelerating bookings growth.
And I'm trying to understand the translation of revenue, broadly speaking, for Cognizant. While bookings has been 
strong, is there something else that we should be thinking about on the other side on attrition, specifically of 
revenues outside of Facebook. And so normally, you would expect that to start to show up next year, but just want 
to make sure we understand the other side. Has there been a greater level of attrition, again, outside of 
Facebook, that would cause revenue growth to perhaps not show up as quickly as we might think over the course 
of the next year or so?
And then, the second question, Brian, is I wanted to see if you could just touch on philosophical margins. And 
what I mean by that, you outlined your four investment areas, and also the benefit associated with how the 
savings plan is going to manifest itself during 2021. But just philosophically, is there any words that you can give, 
without providing specific guidance, on how investors should be thinking about margins given those puts and 
takes associated with 2021? That's it from me. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
So, look, let me start on the revenue question and the bookings question. There's no big story here, to be honest, 
outside of the exit of the non-strategic portion of the content moderation business, which is in our operations 
business. Frankly, I think we're executing well, both in our – most of our verticals, say we've got more work to do 
in Financial Services, but even Products and Resources, we're doing well in the areas that are not consumer 
goods, and travel and hospitality. And so, I just feel we have growing momentum, Keith, but I'm very cautious to 
commit anything because of the macro environment.
The bookings is real. When I look at bookings by renewal versus expansion versus new, just feels as though we 
had in the last 1.5, 2 years, maybe lost a buildup of backlog, and we had eroded that. And now, we started 
replenishing what I would call [indiscernible] (00:53:36). And now, we're in a position where I'm feeling better 
about the future. So, there's no major story there. And the more we can keep up this bookings momentum, the 
better, because it's inevitable, then it will show up in revenue. So, we just need to keep executing.

With regards to margins, in some ways, revenue versus margin tradeoffs, I guess, comes into mind. Look, I think 
about this always in two ways. First of all, it's important to differentiate between a cost and an investment. And 
secondly, growth investments will be prioritized versus short-term margin optimization. And our goal is ultimately 
to increase our wealth and commercial momentum, and to revitalize revenue growth. And we will make some 
short-term margin tradeoffs to achieve this.
We're investing meaningfully in the business, probably even more than I anticipated a year ago because the more 
I'm here, the more I see opportunities. In talent overall in our management – talent management system, we're 
accruing bonuses at higher levels. We're getting back to a merit-based promotions and raises. In digital, we're 
attracting talent, which is a constrained asset, and therefore, an expensive asset. We're upgrading our client 
partners to be better able to represent Cognizant beyond the traditional CIO, CTO organization.
The targeted M&A that we're doing, which I'm very pleased with, comes with integration costs, and while gross 
margins are reasonable, we do have some margin dilution on the operating income level because of the SG&A 
nature – intensive nature of those businesses that we're scaling. And then, of course, we're continuing to build our 
commercial hiring, rebuilding our bench, which will lead our delivery costs, investing in automation, branding, 
marketing. We got overall our internal systems and tools, remediate and modernize our IT and security, and 
globalize our delivery network. So, I've got plenty on my mind to find a way to continue to show margin expansion.
And as I've said, 2020 was, in my perspective, a very challenging year from a margin perspective because of 
ransomware, because of COVID. I'd like to think that as we've gone through our restructuring program, as we got 
more operational rigor, as we continue to work on pricing and renewals, up-selling and cross-selling in our 
existing accounts, optimizing our pyramid, our near and offshore mix versus on – our automation agenda.
I'd like to think we can do what's needed in investments, and yet continue to show margin expansion at a pace 
that is appropriate for us to continue to invest in the business. And for investors, who're interested in that story, I 
think there's way to more compelling investments in Cognizant at this moment in time.

James E. Friedman
Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Q
Hi. Thank you. I was wondering, Brian, do you have any view at this point on 2021 budgets. And if that's too hard, 
just more generally, how important do you think your client budgets are in terms of impacting Cognizant's 
fortunes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Well, it's an interesting question, James, where there's many moving parts, I would say, a macro demand and on 
client fund behavior. So, on one hand, I really feel good about our momentum today, bookings momentum up 
15% year-to-date. And behind every one of those bookings, either a renewal or expansion or a new logo is a 
client win. So, the first thing I'll say is macro demand is better maybe than the most pessimistic analyst suggested 
back in April, which is good for the entire industry. But of course, in a world of vendor consolidation, some like 
Cognizant will do better than others.

Second thing is maybe against this protracted pandemic, clients have become increasingly decisive with their 
technology priorities, and indeed their spend decisions, which is also good because uncertainty is the real enemy. 
Third, we're less exposed to some troubled verticals or customer segments than others. Travel and hospitality, 
retail and consumer goods is less than 15% of our mix. We really focus on the global 2000 customer 
segmentation. So, SMB issues are less concern for us. And fourth, we have momentum in digital. We 
strengthened our portfolio, and it can be a winner while determining the next phase of digital. And I think that 
inflection point is real, by the way.
On the other hand, this week's growing COVID-19 numbers and the latest restrictions, including lockdowns that 
were announced across Europe today, are a major cause for concern for us. And it's unclear whether this will 
really impact the decision-making and indeed budgets. So, what has looked more promising at least in months 
may turn against us. And so, that leaves us in a situation that is challenging going into the months ahead because 
we have to figure out how to optimize our bench, and how to reduce utilization a little, and make sure we continue 
to get the right skills into Cognizant, but at the same time, watch demand signals and customer bond behavior like 
a hawk.
With regards to customer buying behavior, look, I would say, they're more decisive, as I said, they are speaking –
seeking more strategic or trusted partners to help them through the pandemic. There's some very short-term or 
cyclical priorities. They would include all the things you would expect, remote working enablement, e-commerce, 
AI and analytics with a view to doing hyper-personalization activity. There's a whole set of initiatives clients are 
looking at to provide cost relief, CapEx reductions. And I see more and more clients look towards enhanced 
resiliency, security, agility and scalability, so the whole notion of cloud acceleration will continue.
The implications of this, for sure, there's some freed up opportunities in the short term around e-commerce and 
working remotely. Certainly sort of larger, I would call, longer payback projects like [indiscernible] (00:59:47) are 
slower, but there are some larger opportunities that have been freed up, including captives that we will look at 
carefully, because unlike the book of business we've been acquiring through M&A, captives can be revenuecatered dilutive. There're lots of vendor consolidation opportunities, which is good for us in legacy. And by the 
way, I would say increasingly good for us in digital because I am seeing some key with certain suppliers or socalled digital incumbents who're perhaps less malleable or flexible than Cognizant on Ts & Cs and pricing.
And look, there's other things happening in parallel. The pandemic is truly forcing companies to look at virtual 
agile, and perhaps a greater consideration as to when they partner versus bring work in as. So, those things are 
real, and I think that's impacting budgets for the coming year. As long as the situation doesn't get materially 
worse, the most important thing is clients are making decisions faster, and they're more decisive leading into a 
budget cycle. If things get worse, then I think we may end up as an industry, not just in services, but beyond back 
in the world of pain again.
The real trend that I'm 100% focused on, and we will put all our resources and effort behind this, relates to digital. 
That's a secular trend. It's strong. Our bookings are strong. Our pipeline is strong. We've got an improving brand. 
We see strength in digital engineering, where we're showing up very well these days, Software-as-a-Service, AI 
and analytics, interactive. And like I said, clients, I think, are now hitting a point where they've almost reached an 
epiphany that they've upgraded their tech stack. But at the same time, they're wondering if they're getting 
adequate returns from this based on everything they spent.
And so, if you think about Phase 3 of digital, and think of COVID as a very, very low tide that exposes everything 
before the enormous tsunami wave comes in and follows, we're seeing clients realize that their platforms, their ecommerce capabilities are clunky, they're inadequate, their marketing is actually more analog than digital, they

kind of hyper-personalize things like data hierarchies for engineering, their processes are so people-intensive that 
they're unscalable.
And so, in essence, even though, we've gone through multiple phases of digital, what we've really been doing 
around the edge has been upgrading the tech stack and the infrastructure data and application layer for nondigital-native companies. And that fundamentally doesn't solve all of their problems. And clients, I think, going to 
this budget cycle and beyond in the years ahead will become much more savvy to the fact that they need to 
become a much more software and data driven. They must embrace user experiences. And they ultimately must 
shift use cases to agile digital workflows. That's what we're focused on. That's where we're pointing our guns. And 
we'll participate elsewhere, but we will definitely focus on digital, and we're committed to that.

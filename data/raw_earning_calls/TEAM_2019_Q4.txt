Ian Lee
Head-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On the call today, 
we have Atlassian's Co-founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial 
Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2019. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of 
Atlassian's website at investors.atlassian.com. On our IR website, there's also an accompanying presentation and 
data sheet available. We'll make some brief opening remarks and then spend the rest of the call on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements 
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking results. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. 
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such 
statements are made.
Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in 
filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section entitled 
Risk Factors in the most recent Form 20-F and quarterly report on Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures 
are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures 
versus their nearest IFRS equivalents, and they may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used 
by other companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings 
release, our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.
I will now turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks before we move to Q&A.

Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. Fiscal 2019 was another outstanding year for Atlassian. We surpassed 
150,000 customers and exceeded the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time in fiscal year. We achieve this 
while generating more than $400 million in free cash flow during the year. I'm incredibly proud of the work of more

than 3,600 Atlassians who come together each day to build the great products that our customers love. Our 
customers have always been our guiding light. Over the past 17 years, our commitment to these customers has 
led us to make pragmatic decisions about the evolution of Atlassian and our products. 
Today, they're leading us towards the cloud. Demand for our cloud products is increasing, both from new 
customers and from existing customers using our on-premises products. It's natural that the cloud is our primary 
focus and the key driver of our growth. In fiscal 2020, we will continue to invest deeply in improving and 
expanding our cloud offerings and platform. We will also be investing to serve larger customers in the cloud as 
well as to accelerate the pace of migration of server and data center customers to our cloud. Our pricing and 
packaging strategies will be thusly aligned with these goals. 
Scott and I have always been focused on driving sustainable growth over the long-term. Our increasing cloud 
focus supports this long-term view. In James's section of the shareholder letter, we outlined the financial 
implications of our cloud strategies in fiscal 2020 and we encourage you to read his commentary. 
And with that, I'll pass the call over to the operator for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes 
from Bhavan Suri with William Blair. Please go ahead. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hey, guys. This is actually Arjun Bhatia on for Bhavan. Just wanted to start off with the freemium model that you 
talked about in the shareholder letter. It seems like this is a nice shift to the strategy. Just wondering why this is 
the right time to go freemium in the cloud for specific cloud products, and then what do you think is the benefit 
over offering a one week or a one month trial for customers? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Arjun. It's Mike. I can take that. Sure. I guess I would start by saying firstly it's not really a shift in the 
strategy. We have free versions of a whole series of cloud products today and we have always tried 
philosophically to have the lowest entry point price that we can. A lot of our cloud investments over the last couple 
of years have made this possible so this is sort of the – from that point of view, the culmination of a longer term 
journey in the cloud. We've always tried to get after the Fortune 500,000. We've got to have as many on ramps as 
possible to get customers on-board, as frictionlessly as possible at the low end. And then we deliver them value in 
terms of the products. And then as they grow they will start to become customers. That's always been our pricing 
desire, so this is just another step on that journey in terms of getting after the Fortune 500,000. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks. And then maybe a quick follow-up, but just trying to get a better understanding of where 
customers are in the migration path, especially larger customers from server around premise to cloud. Is this 
something that your larger customers have planned already, or are we still too early for that and something you 
expect to play out over the next few years here?

Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Arjun. It's Jay. It's been playing out over a while. I think the signal that we articulated in the letter is that we're 
seeing increasing demand from a lot of on-prem customers, many of them larger, to consider moving to the cloud. 
And that's been ongoing. We anticipate it will be ongoing. And maybe – there's a couple of great examples of like 
really large U.S.-based asset firm that's beginning to plan a move to the cloud and that's a large existing server 
customer that has 8,000 users of Jira and 10,000 users of Confluence. 
And on the other side of that cloud journey, they can anticipate taking it up to 15,000 users. There's a large 
European athletic clothing manufacturer that's going through the same journey, and a lot of the catalysts for it is 
just the broad secular shift that's been happening around us in the market where 90% of new customers are in the 
cloud. But a lot of it is these large customers see the investments that we've made in cloud and then these 
advantages that cloud brings them in terms of performance, the ability to have the service managed and updated 
for them, and then more reliability, in some cases. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Arjun Bhatia

Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Operator: The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. So I was at Atlassian Summit a few months ago where 
you offered all attendees up to 2,000 free cloud software licenses to accompany their on-prem licenses, and 
obviously it looks like you've now opened this offer up to your entire community and on a matching basis as well. 
Would it be fair to conclude that as a result you've seen high levels of interest and activity from that promotion a 
few months back? Any color kind of around that in terms of what you've seen from customers will be helpful. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Hey, Gregg. This is Jay again. I think it partly was the response – yeah, it is in response to a lot of interest 
in the cloud. And the goal was just making the journey that customers are considering easier for them, and part of 
that is in the offer that you mentioned and the matching free cloud trial license that we're offering existing sort of 
customers so they can begin to plan out migration. The other component is just the investments that we've made 
in product and migration tooling. The migration tooling has come a long way from where we've had the 
opportunity for customers to export and import, and now I think some really innovative work in helping them move 
project by project pieces of Jira and Confluence from their on-prem instances into the cloud. Being over the broad 
backdrop of that is in response to where customers are signaling they want to go and our goal is to make that as 
smooth and as friction-free as possible. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
All right. That's really helpful. Thanks, Jay. And then congrats as well on eclipsing 150,000 customers, and you've 
now provided another long-term goal of more than 100 million active users versus over 10 million cloud MAUs 
today, and we look forward obviously to track in that progress as you continue to grow. But my question there is if

you could talk to the investments required in infrastructure and engineers and then acquisitions that you think are 
required to make this goal a reality, also does this require an accelerated multi-year investment in cloud or would 
you say that you're currently on a good pace from an investment standpoint? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Scott Farquhar
Co-founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Gregg, Scott here. I can take that. Look, the investments we're making on the cloud, we've been a cloud company 
for 10 years and we're making continued investments in improving our cloud for our customers. As Mike 
mentioned earlier, some of the investments around Vertigo we talked about which was moving our cloud off our 
own data centers into third party data centers has allowed us to reduce our COGS so we can now offer a free 
version. Investments we made in infrastructure and platform have allowed us to bring access – use a 
management product to market. They also allow us to get a premium product to market as well. So we made a lot 
of investments over time that are paying off now. As Jay mentioned, we're making investments in migrations, as 
mentioned in the letter, that Confluence, we've got a great migration tool and we're continuing to improve it. That's 
going really well. We're investing in Jira migrations tools as well which we expect to have – be similarly 
successful. And over time, one of the things this year is going through that journey of migrating customers with 
some of the largest customers of ours to the cloud. And through that I'm sure there'll be little things we'll discover 
that we'll be working with our customers on. But broadly I don't see a change in our investment mix in order to do 
this. It's sort of more of continuing what we've been doing all along.

John DiFucci
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Thank you. So Mike and Scott, you talked about the opportunity to help your customers migrate to the cloud. I 
guess given your new name, are there any thoughts around the undersea opportunity? That's a bad joke, I'm 
really sorry. But the real question is...

Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
The real question is this. Is there a reason that cloud's better for Atlassian, like pricing, stickiness, or is this just 
doing what customers want, which seems to be part of your DNA and part of your success all along? Or is there

something else, though, that from a financial perspective cloud would be better than on premise deployments? 
Thanks. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Scott Farquhar
Co-founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
John, look, we've always been customer-weighting whatever we do, and that's all we have both deployment 
options at the moment. And we are not trying to push our customers one way or another from a financial 
perspective or any other reason. We were very happy with kind of both sides of our business. The demand is 
there for customers to go to cloud. I do think that as – when customers are in cloud, it allows us to – you get the 
feature usage information that allows us to be a bit sharper with our R&D investments. It doesn't show up in any 
balance sheet or P&L or anything like that but it does allow us to kind of build better products quicker. 
It allows us to cross-sell our products a lot easier and because they're on the same system, they can certainly –
we can expose them to Opsgenie without the need to set anything up in their environment, so it allows us to do 
that better. And from a [ph] virality (00:13:58) perspective in helping people sign up to products, it allows us to 
effectively – with all the analytics we've got, we can make sure that people go through that journey a lot quicker. 
And I think we shared in our shareholder letter that the financial results over the long term are marginally better 
for us at Atlassian and we feel good about that as well. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
John DiFucci
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Okay. That all makes sense. Thank you. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Operator: The next question comes from Nikolay Beliov of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jacqueline Cheong
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hi. This is actually Jacqueline of for Nikolay. Two questions. First, in light of the fiscal 2019 billing seasonality, 
how should we think about fiscal 2020 billings trajectory? And number two, how do we think about the use cases 
of the Premium Edition, will the channel be involved in selling premium? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Okay. Jacqueline, I can take the first one. Now just a reminder, obviously we very much focused much more on 
revenue than billings, and that's for the fact that, of course, deferred revenue is a relatively small part of our 
overall sales picture, particularly the long-term deferred revenue because we really don't enter into very many 
multi-year contracts at all. And then when you add to that, of course the cloud business growing very strongly as 
we've been discussing. And more than three quarters of that comes with a monthly subscription. So those are 
some of the key reasons why we really focus on revenue as opposed to billings. 
So as you know, we don't guide to billings in fiscal 2020 but what I would just observe is that in the last couple of 
years the billings patent has moved around somewhat based on the timing of price increases that we rolled out. 
So for example, in fiscal 2019 last year, we announced some price increases in the middle of September. And so 
there we saw a pull forward activity occurring to benefit Q2, and that benefit was pulling activity from the second 
half of fiscal 2019 and in fact from fiscal 2020 and even beyond there. Now conversely in fiscal 2018, we 
announced price increases a little earlier, right at the start of September. And in that year the pull forward benefit 
was really a balance between both Q1 and Q2, and that benefit was pulling in part from Q2, but then more so

from Q3. So that's really all I would just remind everyone on. Obviously we haven't made any price increase 
announcements for fiscal 2020, but that gives you a sense for the recent historical pattern and how price increase 
activity can impact billings by quarter. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And hey, Jacqueline. This is Jay. I'll tap on to the second part of your question. There's two kind of unique 
components of the premium cloud additions. The first is kind of common across them which are platform 
capabilities that offer a higher service and support level, and in some cases, depending on the product, higher 
storage levels as an example. The second component is premium features that really target more advanced and 
sophisticated users that are specific to the product. And so roadmaps in Jira or usage analytics and Confluence 
are two of the examples. And so the customers that premium additions target can be small and just more 
sophisticated users, but more often than they not will be larger. So that's who we're targeting – absolutely the 
channel is engaged in selling and supporting customers, both upgrading from standard cloud to premium 
additions, but in many cases just starting with premium.

Operator: The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Sanjit K. Singh
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Hi, this is Sanjit Singh for Keith Weiss. Congrats on a very strong Q4. I have two questions. The first is on the sort 
of cloud unit economics if you will. You had a really nice chart in the earnings letter and it basically shows a 
breakeven time between cloud and server of about two years and about a 40% higher lifetime value. So then 
maybe dovetail on John's question, what do customers get for that for paying that extra 40% over five years? Is it 
more about the performance scalability, or is there a feature functionality aspect to this as well that gives the 
maintenance based customers that nudge to deliver to cloud? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Sanjit. Look, from a pure value point-of-view, probably the biggest difference they get is obviously we're 
doing all the operations and maintenance of the software for them. So if you think about someone paying the 
licensing fee, they then have to download, have their own server in-house, run their own upgrades, patches, et 
cetera, of the software. That takes time, as well as integrating it, connecting it to other things, administering it. 
That is a large list that we can take often that's often well more than the price of the software itself. 
Obviously, we can provide that at a small uplift over a multi-year period as you said, but we can scale that cost 
across many, many instances, right? Obviously, we're deploying tens of thousands of servers if you want to think 
about it virtually. On a constant basis we've automated all that and we can spread that cost across a lot of 
customers. At the same time they get a better updated, more frequently updated application that should be faster, 
more secure, more scalable without them having to do anything, right? That's the goal of the cloud is that they just 
sign up with 10 users and they can go all the way to 10,000 without really having to think too much about that 
scale effect. That's exactly what we do in our R&D and engineering teams is make sure that that all happens for 
them. And obviously, any new innovations all the way through to new security patches get applied instantly. They

just appear sort of magically for them. So it's a far better offering. It's generally the premise behind our cloud 
software. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Sanjit K. Singh
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Understood. That's really helpful. And then if I could revisit the pricing strategy question. So for the last two years, 
I think – about two years ago we moved to this cadence of annual price increases and the view was that was 
going to be more predictable for the customer base to expect that on the annual basis. It seems like this year is a 
little bit of an anomaly, and I'm wondering is this sort of a – should we look at this fiscal year 2020 as a sort of 
anomaly given the sort of push to cloud and that we'll revisit this annual price increase on the server base after 
fiscal year 2020, or has the cadence on pricing changed with this cloud push? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well the first thing I'd say, Sanjit, is that as we think about pricing and packaging we continue to be very focused 
on remaining the high value low price leader. And we have said in the past and continue to believe that, well 
within that construct have continuing opportunities to made price changes very much commensurate with the 
value that we're delivering to our customers. Now obviously, we've been talking quite a bit on this call already 
about our focus on the cloud and continuing to really bring more and more customers, be they current, via 
migrations or new customers into the Atlassian frame. And so I would expect that benefits around price increases 
on the cloud side of our business would probably less so in fiscal 2020 than was the case in fiscal 2019. Now 
again, we haven't made any announcements about price increases more broadly, but I think that's a reasonable 
thing for you to consider.

Michael Turits
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks. I think [indiscernible] (00:23:09) when you drilled down on Gregg Moskowitz's question about 
any change in financial impact from the quantum investment. Maybe let me just extend it to the long run, 
obviously [indiscernible] (00:23:21). In any case this seems like an acceleration, but is there anything different we 
should think of in the long term, either OpEx, either CapEx framework, anything around creating an impact on 
gross margins, the amount of CapEx being anticipated or any breaks that we might expect in terms of significant 
changes over a multi-year period? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. So Michael, as we think about the cloud continuing to become a larger and larger proportion of our overall 
business, I would expect that to have some impact on our gross margins. You would expect, obviously as Mike 
was pointing out, we're doing all the work of operating the software on behalf of the customer. And so you would

naturally expect there to be an increase in the proportion of cost of goods sold. And indeed we have in the last 
couple of years been investing quite significantly in the sort of physical infrastructure to make sure that our cloud 
customers, wherever they are in the world, have the sort of response time, reliability that they would look to 
receive from our cloud services. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with how as we work with AWS we find 
significant opportunities to continue to make more efficient our usage of the cloud infrastructure. 
And so you can expect us to continue to be focusing on that over time. And then of course there are other lines 
embedded within cost of goods sold and we'll – areas such as support, and we would look to continue to seek 
efficiencies there as well. And so it's a mixture of a variety of effects around gross margin net-net. I've been 
pleased with how we continue to progress on the gross margin line. And in terms of capital expenditure, the way 
our relationship now works with AWS, really the capital expenditure related to cloud infrastructure sits with AWS 
on their balance sheet. Our capital expenditure is very 
much driven by our own physical facilities around our primary offices. So I wouldn't expect the growth of our cloud 
business to particularly be driving that CapEx line per se. We'll see that effect flow through operating expenditures 
as we work with AWS. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Michael Turits
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
And then James, a follow up for you on the guidance for this year, and I don't know if this is related to the cloud 
push or not, but your guidance on op margins, EBIT margins down 1 point, I assume some of that is from the 
Agile acquisitions, and then maybe you can specify how much that impact is, but if you look at the cash flow from 
ops guidance, that just comes down about 6 points. I understand based on the math you gave us that about two 
of that are $30 million comes from higher taxes, but there's still more impact to cash flow here in [indiscernible] 
(00:26:36) taxes and maybe you could specify that for us. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Michael, the first thing I'd say about margins is I'm very pleased that we've been able to grow in fiscal 2019, both 
the operating margin up 1 point and the free cash flow margin up 2.9 points year-over-year. And as you know, 
we've been saying how we will continue to look to build our margins, both operating and free cash flow, over time. 
And so the guidance that we put out today as you correctly indicated in your question on the operating margin 
line, one of the key impacts there is the acquisition of AgileCraft now branded Jira Align, because remember that 
that has more of a services component to the business model. And of course, for certainly the first three quarters 
of fiscal 2020, we'll be working through that typical deferred revenue haircut that comes along with an acquisition. 
So that will particularly impact that. And then on the free cash flow guide, again you correctly referenced there a 
quite sizable swing in cash taxes year-over-year. So in fiscal 2019, we actually received $7 million of cash related 
to taxes. I would expect that to return to a much more normal situation in fiscal 2020. And so net-net between the 
two years, it'll be a swing of around $30 million approximately in cash taxes. So that will have an appreciable 
impact on the free cash flow margin. 
The other thing I would note on free cash flow margin, of course, is the capital expenditure we've indicated would 
be $30 million for fiscal 2020. So that will be down quite substantially year-over-year. And that just reflects, going 
back to my facilities point, that we've worked our way through some of the key facilities projects that we've been 
working on in fiscal 2019, hence a smaller capital expenditure projection for this year.

Michael Turits

All right. James, just there's still a gulf, in other words you're still coming down a lot more on cash flow margin

Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for taking a couple of questions. It's going to go back to the opportunity around cloud 
within – its sort of expansion rates within existing customers. Could you just kind of outline for us again what you 
see as far as adoption in expansion rate you know maybe by, by users within your larger customers when one 
customer goes with the cloud path and the other one goes the on-prem path. I mean, is there a way to quantify 
that for us a bit? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Scott Farquhar
Co-founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Alex, this is Scott here. I won't to get into specific numbers around that but I can use some anecdotes that are 
very exciting for us. We've got a growth team here at Atlassian who run a lot of growth experiments, maybe 
similar to what you see in some consumer type companies. And that team has grown pretty substantially over the 
last year. And we've had some really successful experiments cross-selling, say, Jira into the – Confluence into the 
Jira base which is a very well overlapping product in server, very well overlapping product in cloud. But because 
we're running those products in the cloud, we have the opportunity to run these experiments where we can, adjust 
the interface, promote something in product and see if it works before we spend the effort in productionizing it and 
rolling out to our entire base. And so we're seeing that work in those particular pair of products over the last year 
which is a focus area. We're expanding that to look at other sort of product [indiscernible] (00:31:06) in the coming 
years. And again, stuff that we can do in the cloud that – we have done it in the server but it's a lot harder and 
takes a lot longer to see the returns. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Okay, thanks. And the common in the shareholder letter around the 1 point of revenue headwind for the year 
around these changes that you guys have outlined today. Is there some way to kind of outline, is this a base case 
assumption on the uptick in subscription and cloud? Is it backend loaded as far as how you think that headwind is 
going to play out during the year? Any kind of additional context would be helpful.

Yeah. I would say obviously we talked in the last year about there being really three drivers of that 1 point, so the 
free editions, the free cloud trials to our current behind the firewall customers, and then the revenue recognition 
mix effect. That mix effect would be occurring throughout the year. Obviously, the free cloud trials and the free

Jack Andrews
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Hello. Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask kind of a high level question just about your 
overall product development efforts. I mean, can you shed some light on I guess it's a framework perhaps that 
you're using for resource allocation? I mean, you've got a lot of things going on in terms of – besides the push to 
the cloud, you're introducing net new categories, things like Align, and in some cases to a new user base. So I 
mean could you just talk about higher prioritizing spending more time and efforts on some of these other efforts 
versus adding incremental functions to your existing products. Is there a way to kind of rank order your product 
development priorities? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Scott Farquhar
Co-founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Good day, mate. Mike I can take that. Look, there's no simple and easy way to communicate that. I would 
say it's something that we spend a lot of time thinking about. We've got a lot of history of doing that. You 
mentioned a few acquisitions. Obviously, we realize it's very important to integrate acquisitions in the right 
timeframe, sometimes that's faster, sometimes that's slower. If you look at something like Trello, we've invested a 
lot in growing the Trello business but not so much in integrating it in the short term and not seeing it the opposite 
way around. 
And so we make, I would say, horses for courses decisions depending on what that is. We, at the same time, do 
obviously try to lean into the future. So you can see a lot of our resource allocation is going into the cloud while 
also at the same time being practical about making sure that our on-premises customers get the improvements 
that they need in those applications. I would say we're constantly making decisions on how we move resources 
around whilst at the same time growing. We also have a global problem to constantly manage way our resources 
are around the globe. We've been doing very well in Bengaluru. I was just there a couple of weeks ago, we're 
past 200 staff there now in India and continue to grow really strongly. And where we put resources around the 
world and how new those resources are can affect how – what projects we can put into. So I would say we're 
really good at managing that on a global basis now and I'm pretty comfortable where we sit, but there's no 
singular framework we use.

Well, thanks for your perspective. And just as a follow-up, is there any update in terms of how you're thinking 
about the enterprise advocate role at Atlassian? Do you feel you need to add any more resources in this area just 
given again the emphasis of the cloud, changes in pricing, things like that? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Hey, Jack. This is Jay. I mean, we're growing the team and we've been growing the team over the past 
handful of years. There won't be a material change but we'll continue to add enterprise advocates in sort of direct 
sales as we attack the opportunity. Keep in mind that the business model – I think what makes our business 
model so powerful is the combination of three things this high velocity flywheel that really focuses on enabling 
customers to self-serve and that just allows us to reach massive global volume of customers that can start easily 
on their own, that's number one. Two is our direct enterprise advocate sales team and they can focus on targeting 
high value expansion opportunities that exist within our largest customers. And the third is the channel, and 
oftentimes our direct teams are working hand-in-hand with the channel on expansion opportunities that tend to be 
accompanied by some service delivery work at the channels and able to help with. And that's what makes it so 
great is know we can land in even the largest accounts really efficiently, and we create this really fertile ground for 
our channel and our direct teams to expand from.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, James, I was a little surprised here to see maintenance 
growth actually accelerate this quarter, and then on the flip side a steeper deceleration on subscription growth. 
Are there any puts and takes that you'd call out in terms of the revenue mix this quarter, and then how should we 
think about how much license and maintenance growth steps downs next year as you focus more on the cloud? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. So for Q4, we are pleased with the maintenance growth rates. Obviously, you're starting to see the price 
increases from really the last couple of years layering into that that figure now. On the subscription growth rate, 
behind the firewall component of that subscription revenue line had a particularly strong comp back in Q4 of fiscal 
2018. And so that's really what drove the result there in this past quarter. We're continuing to be very pleased with 
our cloud business, our marketplace business and our data center business in terms of growth. As we've been 
discussing now for a couple of years or so, we would expect that gradually over time the license maintenance 
side of the business doesn't grow as strongly, and then you see that flowing through in the strong growth of the 
subscription growth line that we gave you a steer on for fiscal 2020 with growth expected there of greater than 
40%.

Great, thanks. And I guess more of a product question regarding the new free cloud license for on-premise 
customers, can you give us a sense as to how long those customers will get the free license and at what time 
period they'll have to start paying added fees for the cloud service? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Scott Farquhar
Co-founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
It's Scott here. The freemium model, there's many different ways that companies do that. We have free trials for 
many of our products and we have freemium for many of our products. So the free trials, they're generally a 
couple of weeks, but what we're talking about here is moving many of our products from a free trial approach to a 
freemium approach where there is effectively a feature or user limited version of our products that are free 
forever. And we found through the experiments we've done over a long period of time the fact that we have 
multiple products with different pricing models that the freemium approach, whilst it has some short term 
headwinds in terms of revenue for us, actually provides the best long-term sort of revenue for us as a company. 
And as Mike mentioned earlier, when you're after the Fortune 500,000 and the markets are so large, that's the 
tradeoff we make every day of the week, trading off some short term revenue for long term customer acquisitions. 
So that's what we're doing now, we have free trials and moving to a freemium feature and user-based model.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
George Iwanyc
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my questions. So you had really strong growth with your larger customers, ones over 
$50,000 and $500,000. Can you give us a sense of the factors that are driving the expansion there and maybe 
also a sense of the penetration of your newer products with those larger customers? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, the factors are a couple things, like one we've created in both the on-prem business and now in cloud with 
premium additions, really important upgrade opportunities for those customers as they continue to scale. And so 
that's one factor. We've also expanded the portfolio so we have more products to talk to those customers about 
that are meaningful. And we're doing that well. And so I think those are kind of the two things that are contributing 
to growth in both customers who are spending more than $50,000 and customers who are spending more than 
$500,000. 
There's still a lot of latent opportunity for us to continue to do that. And in concert with the stronger signals of 
cloud, I think we're really excited about the opportunity for premium additions in the cloud as both a similar 
upgrade path or just the existing cloud base that's on standard, that's on the version of cloud that exists today, but 
also as server customers consider the move to cloud, they've got the opportunity to either stay on-prem with an 
upgrade path to data center or to move to the premium version of our cloud products. And both those are 
opportunities, I think, to increase the two cohorts that you described.

George Iwanyc
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
So with the multi-product opportunities that are opening up, can you give us a sense of just the competitive 
landscape? Are you seeing yourself go up against more companies with the larger customers? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Not materially. I think the competitive landscape as we've described before is different by product and by 
category. I think we've got a really strong, I think, advantage with just our existing base and where we're 
expanding from. A lot of these products are deeply connected into, as an example, Jira. And so Jira affords us an 
opportunity, we're the champion in a kind of a key [ph] fanatical (00:42:09) base inside of our customers where 
they're going to look for the best product that actually allows them to extend or to weave kind of capability into an 
adjacency like IT operations management or incident management. So Opsgenie as an example benefits a lot 
from the existing Jira software base of 65,000 customers. And part of the momentum that we're seeing in 
Opsgenie is exactly related to that. And so the competitive landscape doesn't change. I think we lean into our 
advantages and we're focused on building the best product in any category and then using all the levers that we 
can to introduce that product to the customer.

Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States) Q
Hi. Thank you, James. I'm going to start with you. You did mention or talked about the pricing impact to 
subscription. I wanted to extend that. If you thought about the guidance that you gave, is pricing net-net still a 
tailwind as you think about the overall opportunity associated with FY 2020? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yes, it is. I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States) Q
And specifically, you said subscription would probably be less so in 2020 than 2019, is that broadly true of the 
balance of the portfolio as well? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, just to be very clear, my comment was around the cloud part. Now, remember there are two parts to the 
subscription revenue, there's data center as well as cloud. But for the cloud part of the business, I would expect 
price increase activity to drive less growth for us than was the case in fiscal 2019.

Hey, Keith. It's Jay. No metrics. But in terms of traction, we're really pleased in just the response that we're seeing 
from customers and the momentum we saw in the first quarter. I think the timing of the announcement was 
something that certainly helped, and I think you heard us, I think you were at Summit, you heard some of the 
interest just directly from like ANZ Bank on the stage when we talked about their interest in agile transformation 
and the consideration set around your Jira Align and AgileCraft part of that. Q1 was our first full quarter with the

Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice to see continued strong results. Two, kind of broad classes of 
questions. First, on the cloud migrations and then I've got a follow-up on Trello. But on the cloud migrations side 
to kind of piggyback off Sanjit's observation earlier, and the chart that you gave us was really helpful, and then 
you talk about – it essentially comes out to about a 1.4x uplift from server to cloud. Or even if we look at year five, 
maybe closer to maybe a 1.6x to 1.7x uplift, I know with other software companies when they've talked about 
migrations to cloud, they've talked actually about a 2x to 3x. So maybe just help me understand why the delta? 
And I just feel silly complaining about it, but why is that uplift not bigger? And alongside that, in terms of driving 
the migrations, should we start to see something like cloud-only features or cloud only products as an incentive to 
help customers migrate? And then I've got a follow-up on Trello.

[indiscernible] (00:46:43) the first part, which is the cloud migrations and the uplift. Firstly, it's an illustrative 
example. We've put into the document – at each segment there's different pricing characteristics. Two is that we 
have always been patient for revenue with our customers and making sure that there are less barriers to move 
across to the cloud is very important for us as well. And so a lot of the pricing we've set there is to help customers 
move across to the cloud. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co. Q
Okay, got it. Thanks. And then just in terms of from a product perspective and anything in terms of should we 
expect to see cloud-only features or cloud-only products to help kind of incentivize customers to migrate. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, mate. It's Mike here. We do have a series of cloud-only features and products if you think about it, so 
Opsgenie, Statuspage, Align are all cloud-only products that are aligned to support on-premises instances in 
terms of the data it can attract. And then you've seen us introduce specific cloud-only features like Access. And 
even within the Jira family, within Confluence, there is some slight feature differences between on-premises 
products and cloud products. So yes, there are already, I guess, some feature differences but by and large if 
you're using Confluence or Jira Software or Jira Service Desk, they're still largely the same product on both sides. 
We do make sure that data compatibility is really important. So for the customers that are migrating, we 
mentioned the Confluence Migration Assistant we released a few versions of during the year and the upcoming 
Jira Migration Assistant. That requires us to be able to move, especially for the large volume of smaller 
customers, to move that data automatically so we do make sure that data compatibility is really important. But 
there are feature differences between the two for sure. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co. Q
Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just quickly on Trello, you did mention in the material that you had an uplift 
in customers or paying customers with the result of kind of the board limits, can you be – I think just help us 
understand what kind of the result to them, was that a conversion of free to paying, was that something else? And 
then maybe talk a little bit about the traction you're seeing with the Trello Enterprise. Thanks. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Look, Trello has a continued to power on very strongly. We're very happy about how it's going. As we've 
said, look, our primary goal with Trello is still to continue to establish Trello as a brand, Trello as a product and 
continue to grow the momentum that it has as a standalone business. We are doing more and more integration 
over time, but that's a long term journey. We did introduce some pricing changes throughout the year. You've 
seen some of the impact of that as we've called out in the customer number this quarter. Some of that is a onetime benefit that we've talked about because while the flow of Trello customers will be marginally higher, we are 
changing some of the free to paid conversion rates. And that from a large existing free base, obviously you get 
some of the existing base converting over to a faster rate, which is what we've called out in the customer number 
there. 
At the same time, we are focused on Trello Enterprise. We've had a really good couple of quarters in Trello 
Enterprise as we continue to invest in features there. We put that into the shareholder letter as well. As 
businesses adopt Trello with tens of thousands of users and beyond, they do have different sets of requirements

that we continue to work with the customers on establishing. When you have hundreds of thousands of boards 
across a customer, you need methods of organizing that content, finding that content, managing large scale 
users, et cetera, which is exactly what we've been doing in the Trello Enterprise product. And obviously, with such 
a large installed base in Trello, that has a very good future.

Great. I just wanted to – and I apologize for missing the slot earlier. I just wanted to ask real quickly about 
Opsgenie. You commented about how it accelerated the pace of additional paid users and was just wondering if 
you could talk a little bit about how you're seeing that cross-sell opportunity into your Jira installed base and like is 
there any color that you could share about kind of where you're seeing the success of kind of cross-sell across 
those products? Thank you. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Heather, I can't get into the specifics, but as you mentioned we mentioned in our shareholder letter that we've 
doubled the pace of customer acquisition and we feel really good about that acquisition. If you walk through their 
internal charts, there is a distinct change when Opsgenie became Atlassian and we feel great about that. If you –
in chatting with customers, it's a great product. Sometimes I've mentioned that the acquisition, sometimes you 
acquire something and you have to add features to it or make it enterprise ready, and Opsgenie actually scales 
better than any of the other products out there on the market. And so for us it was just a matter of getting it in front 
of our customers. I know we're still very early in the journey of putting it on the Atlassian platform, and we're really 
happy with the pace that we've only sort of acquired it less than a year ago and we've already done identity and 
user interface and stuff like that. So we're sort of at the – still at the start is what I think of in terms of cross-selling 
into our existing base.

And then, Heather, I would just add that when we announced the acquisition of Opsgenie we noted that it would 
drive a point of revenue growth on the then revenue guidance for fiscal 2019, and I'm pleased to say that we 
achieved that, so strong momentum.

Okay that's great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up, is it – so it's net new customers that you're getting from this 
[ph] two-plus (00:53:07) expansion into the installed base. So you see the opportunity on both fronts, is that 
correct?

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go 
ahead.

Joe Goodwin
Analyst, JMP Securities, LLC Q
Hi. This is Joe Goodwin on for Pat. I just wanted to ask real quickly about how's your relationship with Slack 
going? And can you speak to some of the opportunities that may be on the horizon? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Joe. It's going great. I mean, we've got, I think, a good relationship, great integration that we continue to 
improve between the products. We're in the market, I think, talking to customers at both of our user conferences 
and events about the relationship that exists and the value for customers when they integrate them more deeply. 
You saw that at Summit where we talk a lot about just how we use Slack internally and extend their products and 
their users of our products at the same time and doing the inverse. So it's good.

Joe Goodwin
Analyst, JMP Securities, LLC Q
Great. And then just a quick follow-up, is the monitoring space a space that you guys would ever enter into? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Scott Farquhar
Co-founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Scott here. At the moment that's not an area that we're actively looking at. There are a lot of players in that space 
and there's no clear winner. We've benefited a lot more from integrating with the leaders in that space and we 
have a great relationship with all the leaders in that space.

Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Again, it's Mike. I might just add, philosophically if you look at our history, we do try to solve human and people 
problems not technology problems. And so where we stray into areas where you're solving a technology problem, 
be it language-specific features or analytics-specific features, it's not our core DNA, right? We're a collaboration 
company around teams of people, something like Opsgenie where you're coordinating people is much more in our

wheel house of strength in our DNA as a business around solving people and collaborative problems around 
technology rather than actually solving technology problems per se.

Operator: The next question comes from Greg Howell (sic) [Gray Powell] (00:55:47) with Deutsche Bank. 
Please go ahead. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Gray Powell
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Great. Thanks. You may have already touched on this, I joined a little bit of late but I just wanted to make sure I 
understood some context behind the fiscal 2020 guidance. How should we think about the acquisition contribution 
to revenue growth in fiscal 2020? And then is there any residual impacts on operating margins, particularly from 
AgileCraft? 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, we haven't broken out any specific acquisition element of the fiscal 2020 guide. Obviously, we have just 
been talking about how pleased we are with Opsgenie and Jira Align, and so we're looking for those both to 
continue growing strongly during fiscal 2020. In terms of the operating margin effect around Jira Align in 
particular, we'll be working through the deferred revenue haircut that comes along with every software acquisition 
and so that will impact the Jira Align revenue growth rate during fiscal 2020. We'll still have some of that for 
Opsgenie as well, but we're three quarters further along that pathway with Opsgenie. So during fiscal 2020, their 
deferred revenue haircut should start to ebb. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Gray Powell
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. 
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the

Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co.
Thanks, John, and I appreciate everyone joining the call today and I hope you and your families are doing well. 
Today's agenda will begin with an overview of our Q1 results. Next, I will update you on the progress we are 
making with our transformation journey. Ken will then discuss our financial results in more detail and our updated 
guidance. And finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions.
Our transformation journey is creating value but as you can see with the shortfalls in the quarter, we need to do 
better. The good news is we have the right plan for FY 2023. We are laser-focused on executing this plan with my 
team of operators, and the work that needs to be accelerated is within our control. We've done a nice job of 
investing in our business that has produced a stronger quality company and deeper customer relationships that 
have positively changed our reputation in the industry.
When I talk about the quality of company that we are, I want to highlight we continue to improve our free cash flow 
generation. Debt and capital allocation is being well-managed. We have portfolio shaped and sold off businesses 
that were distractions to our strategy. We have consistently grown GBS and narrowed the declines of GIS while 
moving our revenue mix towards the higher value business of GBS. And finally, we've improved our governance 
significantly.
Concerning customer relationships, the NPS score that we communicate during these calls shows that we now 
have deep customer relationships because we are delivering. Our customers trust us with their mission-critical 
systems and now trust us with their higher value business needs, which is evidenced by the consistent growth of 
our GBS business.
New and existing customers are turning to us for their ITO and Modern Workplace needs because of the quality of 
company we have built and our reputation that we deliver for our customers. As you heard last quarter, our plan 
for FY 2023 was to begin the year with lower margins and to increase them throughout the year. We are 
accelerating our cost optimization to reduce $500 million in cost by the end of the year. Not only is my 
management team focused on this, but so am I.
I want to remind everyone that roughly the same team of operators took out $700 million of annualized costs in 
FY 2021 while delivering for both our customers and colleagues and clearly expanding our margin. It's this 
experience that gives us confidence that we can do it again.
The Q1 results are as follows. Revenue was $3.71 billion and minus 2.6% organic. Book-to-bill was 0.87 in the 
quarter. This shortfall was within our control. We purposely pushed out deals in the areas of ITO and Modern 
Workplace due to poor economics. All that being said, we are currently at a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.06 
and we expect to be back over 1 in Q2.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 7% and EPS was $0.75. And finally, free cash flow was negative $12 million, which is 
a significant improvement from the negative $304 million that we produced last year.

Now, let me give you some additional color around our transformation journey. The first step is to inspire and take 
care of our colleagues. It is very clear that people want to join DXC, which used to be an issue in the market. I'm 
very pleased by the way we have taken care of our people impacted by the Russian-Ukraine conflict and COVID19.
Concerning our customers, our most recent NPS score was 30, which is on the high end of the industry 
benchmark range. I mentioned earlier that customers are now trusting us with their higher value business needs 
and our Analytics & Engineering offering is a great example of where we have consistently performed well in the 
market.
From one of the world's leading retailers, we are changing the way their loyalty program works to enable the 
company to increase revenues and decrease costs. We are transforming their loyalty technology and data to 
better ingest and manage the right data. This data-led transformation is delivering their customers more 
personalized offers so that they can use their loyalty points where they are most impactful across all channels. 
This has increased loyalty and spending, which has helped the retailer grow. In addition, the transformation has 
lowered cost by managing the right data versus all the data.
Analytics & Engineering is an offering that we have consistently grown in double digits, which has helped us with 
our strategy to grow GBS. In Q1, the 2.8% growth in GBS is the fifth quarter of consecutive growth, and we 
narrowed the declines of GIS, producing negative 7.2% growth due to the improvement in Modern Workplace.
Optimized cost is the next step. As I stated earlier, we have high confidence that our cost optimization will 
improve our margins and make DXC easier for our colleagues to work here, easier for our customers to work with 
us, and position us well for the future. We expect to eliminate $500 million of costs. This is comprised of the 
following areas: staff optimization, including increasing productivity and offshoring; contractor conversions; office 
and data center space; network and telecommunications; and third-party spend in the areas of hardware and 
software.
I also want to highlight a reminder that I discussed with my management team that along with these actions, we 
will continue to run the business. This means we will continue to hire for the businesses that are growing like GBS 
and to scale the offshore presence of our global delivery network.
The fourth step is seize the market. Our Q1 book-to-bill of 0.87 was a direct result of more disciplined dealmaking 
and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still a healthy 1.06. New work for the quarter was 57% and renewals were 
43%. As said before, we pushed out a number of deals in the ITO and Modern Workplace areas because we 
believe we can get better economics.
The demand in the ITO and Modern Workplace market is there, and customers want providers that are financially 
stable, are investment grade, and will deliver. That is now DXC and due to these points, our reputation has 
changed in the industry and that is why we are now the safe pair of hands. Deals are coming our way and we are 
being very disciplined in our dealmaking.
Providers have given customers aggressive deals in the past with hopes that they can improve the economics 
over time, and the old DXC was part of that trend. We all know that these deals were hard to economically make 
work. The new DXC is focused on doing good deals from the start and although this disciplined dealmaking may 
have a short-term impact on our book-to-bill, we believe that it will help us longer term improve margins and 
deliver for our customers. All that being said, we expect Q2 to be back over 1.

And finally, I am pleased with the financial foundation and how far we have improved the quality of DXC over the 
last couple of years. We're doing a nice job improving free cash flow and the business is producing results that 
has helped us manage our debt below $5 billion. We have also delivered $900 million to shareholders through our 
capital allocation program while being below our target debt level. And finally, we have significantly improved our 
corporate governance.
And with that, now let me turn the call over to Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth P. Sharp
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, DXC Technology Co.
Thank you, Mike. Turning to our progress on the transformation journey, we continue to move forward on our key 
initiatives. Q1 organic revenue declined 2.6%, 10 basis points or $4 million below the bottom end of our guide. 
Adjusted EBIT margin of 7% was 50 basis points below the bottom end of our guide. Year-over-year, we 
improved free cash flow performance by $292 million. Free cash flow was $88 million, better than the expectation 
we gave on the Q4 call. As a reminder, Q1 cash is seasonally impacted, including software vendor payments and 
incentive payments. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75, $0.05 below the bottom end of the EPS 
range.
Moving to the income statement on slide 12, the first quarter gross margin declined 40 basis points compared to 
prior year, primarily due to increased direct cost as a percent of revenue and unfavorable FX movements. We 
invested in our global delivery network in order to improve our delivery and ultimately allow us to optimize cost. 
While we are making these investments and doing the knowledge transfer, it is leading to higher costs. In 
addition, we made investments to deal with demand in the GBS marketplace, as well as to exit Russia. Finally, we 
need to optimize cost to drive higher margins in GIS.
SG&A as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points, as we made investments in certain corporate functions. 
Other income decreased 40 basis points due to lower non-cash pension income. Our preference is to move 
towards a stronger balance sheet by reducing pension exposure. As a result, adjusted EBIT margins declined 100 
basis points.
Our cost optimization efforts have moved at a slower pace than anticipated as we were thoughtfully building our 
plan. Net interest expense is favorable, benefiting from lower interest expense and higher interest income.
EPS was down $0.09 compared to prior year and was impacted by $0.12 from lower margins, $0.10 from 
unfavorable FX rate movements, $0.02 from higher tax rate. These impacts were partially offset by $0.15 due to 
lower interest expense and a lower share count.
For revenue, the continued strengthening of the US dollar is resulting in $1 billion of headwinds or an additional 
$374 million from our prior guidance. FX is having a more meaningful impact on margins due to a higher 
concentration of cost in US dollars. Year-over-year, FX is negatively impacting adjusted EBIT margin by 
approximately 50 basis points or an additional 25 basis points of margin impact from our prior guidance.
Next, let's turn to our segment results. We continue to see improvement in the business mix, as GBS becomes a 
larger portion of the business. For the quarter, GBS increased 180 basis points to 47.4% of total revenue. GBS 
has consecutively grown for five quarters and is our higher value business with higher margins and lower capital 
intensity. GBS continues to grow organically, up 2.8%, driven by strong analytics and engineering demand. The 
GBS profit margin was down 250 basis points to 11.9%, impacted by higher cost and FX.

GIS organic revenues declined 7.2%. GIS profit margin was 6.5%, an improvement of 70 basis points, benefiting 
from lower cost, a gain on sale of assets, partially offset by FX. With our cost optimization efforts, we expect to 
see improvements in our segment margins in the second half of the year that will continue through FY 2024.
Turning to our six offerings that comprise GBS and GIS, starting with GBS, Analytics & Engineering continued its 
strong organic growth, up 15.7%. Applications declined 2%. Insurance Software & BPS generated $368 million of
revenue, up 0.3%.
Moving to our GIS offerings, Security was down 0.3%. Cloud Infrastructure & IT Outsourcing is performing in line 
with our expectations, with declines moderating at negative 4.4%. Modern Workplace was down 16.1%, an 
improvement from the fourth quarter of down 19.6%. We expect to see continued improvement in Modern 
Workplace throughout FY 2023.
The GIS book-to-bill has been impacted by our increased pricing discipline Mike mentioned earlier. We have 
taken a more disciplined approach to ensure we achieve reasonable economics that appropriately cover our cost 
of capital.
At the end of the day, we believe the market realizes for large-scale IT infrastructure-type work, DXC is the safe 
pair of hands. We believe our competition has been forced to be more rational. As a result, we expect to be able 
to sign work with better economics.
Slide 16 demonstrates how DXC continues to benefit from its financial foundation. Debt continues to decline due 
primarily to FX impacts on euro-denominated debt. Currently, about 60% of the outstanding debt is eurodenominated. At $4.8 billion in debt, we are below our target debt level of $5 billion. We continue to reduce our 
restructuring and TSI-related cash outflows. These expenses totaled $35 million in the quarter, down significantly 
from prior year.
Capital expenditures and capital lease originations as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% in the quarter, down 
from 11.9% in Q1 FY 2022. We continue to thoughtfully examine our capital expenditures and capital leasing as 
our capital intensity presents a significant opportunity to improve cash flow.
As we think about cash generation and capital available for deployment, let me take a moment to discuss the 
interplay of capital or finance lease debt reductions and cash available for capital allocation. In FY 2023, we 
expect to repay $500 million of capital leases, reducing debt. Based on our efforts to better manage fixed asset 
purchases via capital leasing, we expect to reduce borrowings in FY 2023 to approximately $200 million of capital 
lease originations.
So between the capital lease repayment and the lower originations or borrowings, our debt would be reduced by 
an approximately $300 million. The $300 million of capital lease debt reduction provides flexibility to either borrow 
for capital allocation by staying at our target debt level or further de-lever. Our expectation is to hold our $5 billion 
target debt level, yielding cash available for capital allocation of $500 million.
Moving to slide 19, given our current valuation, we believe the best capital allocation decision is to repurchase our 
stock. We have returned $900 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 27.8 million shares or over 10% of our 
outstanding shares since the start of FY 2022.

As of the end of June, we are halfway through our recent $1 billion share repurchase program and are on track to 
complete this prior to reporting our fiscal year results. Further, we are on track to achieve our $500 million of cash 
proceeds due to our previously discussed portfolio-shaping initiative.
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter, revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.58 billion. Two key items addressed 
in our revenue guidance. Foreign currency is expected to be a headwind of 7.2% or almost $290 million yearover-year. Divestitures are expected to reduce revenue by about $93 million, organic revenue growth of minus 
1.5% to minus 2.5%, adjusted EBIT margin, 7% to 7.5%, as we continue to face headwinds from higher cost as a 
percent of revenue and FX, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 to $0.75.
Our updated FY 2023 guidance, revenue of $14.6 billion to $14.75 billion. We now expect foreign currency to be a 
$1 billion year-over-year headwind. This is an increase of over $300 million as compared to prior guidance. 
Divestitures are expected to reduce revenues by about $325 million. Organic revenue remains unchanged at a 
decline of 1% to 2%. Adjusted EBIT margin in the range of 8% to 8.5%, this reflects higher than anticipated costs 
as a percent of revenue and an FX impact of about 25 basis points. We expect margins to improve through the 
second half of the year as we execute on our cost optimization efforts. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of 
$3.45 to $3.75, down $0.40 from our prior guidance. Free cash flow of $700 million reduced by $100 million.
We are reaffirming our guidance for FY 2024. This reflects our confidence in our ability to execute. While we have 
more progress to make with our margins, let's put it in perspective. Over the last couple of years, we have 
improved our margins while offsetting headwinds, including divesting a large portion of our business, revenue 
decline due to legacy terminations, lower pension income and significantly reducing restructuring and TSI. While 
our cost optimization initiatives ramp slower than anticipated, we believe we have the right plan with the right 
operators to accelerate our margins.
With that, let me turn the call back to Mike for his final thoughts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co.
Thanks, Ken, and let me leave you with a few key points. Our transformation journey is creating value and we are 
confident that we are taking the right steps for DXC in the short term that will set us up for success longer term. 
I'm pleased with the quality of company DXC has become with our stable debt, sound capital allocation strategy, 
free cash flow generation focus, investment-grade profile, improved governance and our consistent growth in 
GBS. I'm also pleased with the work our team of operators has done to change our reputation in the industry and 
deliver for our customers to become the safe pair of hands.
We have a good plan, and we are laser-focused on accelerating our cost optimization to improve our margins, 
and we will deliver. And finally, I like the way the ITO and Modern Workplace market is breaking our way, and it's 
up to us to win the new work at economics that benefit DXC longer term.
And with that, operator, please open the call up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan C. Bergin
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to start first just on a demand question. So just can you talk about 
how client conversations are progressing, just as it relates to the macro uncertainty? Is this causing any change in 
deal cycles or conversion? Understanding you've talked about some pushouts that are your own conscious
decisions, but are you seeing anything there in cycle timing conversion, and just if you could break that down 
between maybe US and ex-US clients, if you're seeing any difference in behavior there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Okay. So Bryan, good to hear your voice and thanks for the question. Let me first start by saying we're not seeing 
a real difference between Europe and the US and APAC. So, let's put that aside. The second thing is now, let's 
look at the demand by GBS and by GIS. The GBS demand is definitely there and we're seeing it in our results 
because you can't grow the Analytics & Engineering business 15.7% and also have the book-to-bill of 1.17 if the 
demand wasn't there.
You will also see, I'll comment on the margin at some point in time again through this call, but the investment that 
we made, one of the investments we made in Q1, and this is on me, is that we did build a bench for GBS. That 
market is literally a market that if you can show up with the right skilled people at the client's doorstep first, you're 
going to win the work. But they really, really want to see the skills. And I think everybody on the call knows that 
the demand environment for the skills is high. So we invested, we built the bench. So, we're seeing good demand 
there. I don't see any issues and I love the way that we've now broken the insurance business out and we're more 
laser-focused on doing work for those insurance companies.
Now, in contrast, we see GIS. And GIS, I would also tell you, the demand is there. If you go look at the 
marketplace, you'll see that there are customers in the ITO and Modern Workplace segments that are trying to 
figure out what do they do with their work moving forward. And I made in my prepared comments, they're focused 
on do you deliver for your customers or your customers' reference. Well, that's why I talked so much about our 
customers in my script. Then the second thing is our investment-grade profile. And third is financially, are you 
doing okay. And that's why I talked about the quality of company and I also talked about the safe pair of hands. 
So, we're definitely seeing the deals come our way.
Now, here's the deal. Traditionally, those customers have been given deals where the providers have invested in 
them upfront, only to turn around and then hope to get the economics better moving forward. And we have said, 
when I talk about our disciplined dealmaking, we're not doing that anymore. So, we want the deal to be good for 
both the customer and us right off the bat.
So look, in this quarter, we had – it wasn't just a couple of deals. It was three or four deals that we pushed out 
because we got to the terms, we got to the economics and we didn't like the economics. Do I think those deals 
are lost? No. Because we believe now that those customers know that we are the ones that will deliver. So – and 
look, I said in the call, I expect that our book-to-bill will come back over 1 in Q2. So, demand environment is 
decent for us. I don't see any issues with the demand.

Okay. Okay. Appreciate that [indiscernible] (27:59) my question...

Michael J. Salvino

Bryan, was that the color you're looking for or not?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan C. Bergin
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Yeah. Yes, it was, Mike. So, I appreciate that. And I was going to ask about the risk of loss of those deals but you 
kind of answered that for me. So maybe, I'll ask a free cash flow follow-up here. Just Ken, how are you projecting 
free cash flow cadence over the course of the rest of this year? And the reduction of $100 million, is that 
comparable to margin, kind of half FX, half operational?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Hey, Bryan. So, let me just – I'll do a pivot real fast because the deals that we pushed out, one, those are large 
deals; two, do I expect that they're lost? No. All right? And it's not like we're not actively working with them right 
now to show why the pricing that we gave them was the right pricing. Fair enough?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan C. Bergin
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Yes, understood.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino

Okay. Free cash flow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth P. Sharp
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, DXC Technology Co. A
Yeah. So, just maybe two quick things. So the guide down of $100 million, probably rounded a bit but it's really 
margin – or 100% margin. We thought it was sensible to take that off. And then, fully expect cash to build 
throughout the year and expect to have some good quarters in front of us.

Next question, Kelly Ann?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan C. Keane
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I guess I'll ask about the margins. I think you gave guidance for the first quarter almost 
two months into the quarter already for first quarter. And I'm just a little surprised to see the margin shortfall in 
GBS, and I guess you guys were, too. I'm just surprised that it surprised you the way it did since you were already 
two months in when you gave the guidance. So, just maybe a little color on why the surprise and how long is it 
going to take to fix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Well, Darrin, so I'm not sure it's a surprise, okay? So when I look at what we did in terms of the investment, and 
the investment you can make pretty quick. The margin is based on the fact that, look, we're investing in our global 
delivery network, all right? And what that means is we're fixing the onshore/offshore mix of this company. We're 
also investing in automation. But when you look at what we've done with our centers, which is basically, we have 
a staffing bubble, all right, which means we had two people doing the job of one because we're doing the 
knowledge transfer from onshore to offshore.
We also – when you look at Russia, right, we've scaled Serbia, we scaled Poland, we scaled Romania. So from 
that standpoint, we increased that stuff and whether we increased it one month, two month or three months and I 
wouldn't call it a massive surprise. The second part of the investment was the bench for GBS. And when I look at 
the demand for GBS, I think that's prudent. So, we're making some short-term calls that we think longer term are 
going to serve us incredibly well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth P. Sharp
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, DXC Technology Co. A
Yeah. And I would also add, Darrin, I mean, there's a lot of moving pieces in Q1. So you think about the pension 
impact, Russia that Mike was talking about, dealing with it, the unprecedented move in FX. So – and I would say 
just maybe on the FX side, it did catch us off guard a little bit on the cost side and the concentration of US dollars, 
and we're certainly working it back.
And then, our cost optimization, which we talked about in our scripts and we've been building up to this trying to 
be really thoughtful with it and make sure that we build the knowledge transfer capability offshore to move to work 
as appropriate, and we've probably moved out a little slower on that than we would like. I think when you put all 
that in, it's safe to say we missed our guide. I get your point about your two months into the year, but there's just a 
lot of moving pieces in Q1.

Bryan, sorry about calling you Darrin. That's not good. Sorry about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan C. Keane
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
That's all right. I'm sure hopefully, Darrin can come up with some other questions. But my one follow-up is I think 
the key then is going to be the confidence in the long-term outlook, which was reiterated. If margins are dropping, 
I think investors are going to lose confidence in the fiscal year 2024 outlook of adjusted EBIT margin of 10% to 
11%. Why is that still the right margin target and how confident are you that you can hit that and that doesn't have 
to eventually come down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
No, two things, Bryan. I mean, the bottom line is we have – we are structurally fixing this business. So when you 
look at the onshore/offshore piece, once we get there, we will have better margins in the GIS business, and then, 
that's basically a machine. So when you look at that, that's why I called out, look, two years ago, we took cost out, 
roughly $550 million, I believe, in the current year, $700 million in terms of annualized. And then, we let it [ph] bet 
in (33:22), we make all of our decisions based on looking through the eyes of our customers and colleagues and 
then we knew we were going to take this out again. So when I look at that, all right, fair enough, so the staffing 
bubble, we didn't move as quick as we should have on. But at the end of the day, once we get done with 2023, we 
should be in a very good position to hit our FY 2024 numbers, and that's why we reiterated them.

Rod Bourgeois
Analyst, DeepDive Equity Research LLC Q
Hey, guys. So, I have a question about your overall turnaround journey. You clearly showed some good 
turnaround progress through the March quarter and then you've hit some bumps here in the June quarter. Also, 
during the June quarter, we saw reason for some concern that there could be some margin trade-offs that you 
would encounter as you pursue better growth. So my question is, is it appropriate to say that you're hitting a 
number of margin trade-offs that are seemingly required to drive the revenue growth that you're targeting? And if 
that's an accurate portrayal, in your go-forward turnaround journey, how do you overcome the recent bumps in the 
road to reach your long-term margin targets? I mean, how do you get past the near-term trade-offs in order to get 
to the long-term target? Thanks.

Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Okay. So Rod, let's break this up into revenue and margin, and let's start with the margin. So in the short term, 
right, the decision we made was to invest in the GDN to hire the folks offshore so that we could transfer the work. 
And when I look at that and we get through the knowledge transfer and put the Ukraine situation into Serbia, 
Poland and Romania, look, we're going to be in good shape. You're going to see that we're doing that in basically 
Q1 and Q2 because that's the guide on margin. And then, the margin literally increases through the back half of 
the year because you've got the machine working. So, that's the way I would say that both short term, long term.
In terms of revenue short term, long term, we have two things going on. First, we built the bench. We invested in 
the bench in GBS. And you'll see – we can see our GBS pipeline up. We can see that the book-to-bill is still very 
solid. Then, the other thing is, look, I've been very clear with you all, we are sorting out the GIS market. And those 
deals are there to be had in the market that we're in, whether you think we're in a recession or not. Anytime we're 
in this kind of market, there are not only more outsourcing deals, but they're bigger. And when they're more and 
they're bigger, customers usually want increased cost reductions, and we think we can command pricing that is 
really consistent with how we look at our margins long term, AKA, the 10% to 11%. So anyhow, that's the way I 
see it, Rod.
When you talk about basically where we're at as a company, look, we also said this thing was never going to be a 
straight line. Great example of not being a straight line was free cash flow last year, right? Nobody thought when 
we started at minus $304 million that we were going to get to $743 million. So my view is, look, we're making 
good investments, the decision we're making in the short term, we've got a good plan and high confidence we'll 
continue to create value. I hope people have taken to heart everything else we've done, right, in terms of the 
quality of company, whether it's the debt to capital allocation, whether it's the improved governance score. And 
then, I continue to look at consistently growing GBS when a lot of other folks are struggling. That area is a good 
shining star.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rod Bourgeois
Analyst, DeepDive Equity Research LLC Q
Okay. Great. And then so let me just ask a quick follow-up on this. You've got some competitors, particularly in 
the infrastructure business that are really struggling and there's a lot of messy – call it messy contracts in that 
infrastructure business historically.
Are you seeing clients willing to pay a premium to sort of get out of a messy historical legacy contract and into 
something where the service can be better and with the client willing to invest in digital in a more modern 
approach to the infrastructure problem that they're trying to solve? Are you seeing clients willing to pay up to 
move out of these legacy deals?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
So the short answer to your question is yes and that's what we're focused on. So let me give you some color 
around that.
So, when you get to these points, Rod, where you've got these large deals and they're paying up, we have to 
literally go through line item by line item in terms of why that's appropriate. So, whether it's inflationary costs, 
whether it's costs of, hey, here's the way the deal should have been constructed to begin with or whether or not 
it's just, look, here's the model that we will be using, all right, to make sure we're delivering.

And let's not walk past that last point, meaning here's the model we will be using, meaning a lot of times with 
some of this stuff, Rod, 100% offshore is not the right answer. So, you've got to have a nice mix of onshore, 
offshore. So literally those are the conversations we're having with the demand in the market and it takes a little 
while to get them to understand that actually they've got a good price and they're not going to have to worry about 
the delivery moving forward. So hopefully, that gives you the color, Rod, that you're looking for.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rod Bourgeois

Operator: We'll hear next from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James E. Friedman
Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Q
Hi. The Analytics & Engineering business performed well, was up almost 16% year-over-year. I was just curious 
because I would think of that as somewhat discretionary, but it still was a juggernaut here. So, if you'd just give us 
some context about why that may be performing well in this environment and how you see it going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Thanks, Jamie. So basically, I'll just go back to the example we gave you during the script. What we're seeing 
with Analytics & Engineering is we're able to deliver both increase – helping a client increase their revenues or 
growth and then decrease their cost. So when I gave you the example during the script of the retailer and 
specifically the loyalty program, what's going on there is we're literally dealing with both the technology and the 
data. And as you can imagine, with loyalty, there's a lot of data. And instead of trying to deal with all the data, 
dealing with specific data so that their loyalty points can be used at the right moment has really created a really 
nice situation for this retailer in the sense that they've seen more demand and then the costs have gone down.
So, it's interesting that you have categorized it as discretionary because a lot of times, these customers have 
dealt with both their infrastructure cloud and now what they're trying to deal with is this data and get more out of 
the technology they've put in place. And that's what our Analytics & Engineering business does.
So we're proud about the 15.7%. We expect that it's going to continue to perform in double digits because that's 
what it's been doing for several quarters now. So thanks for that question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James E. Friedman
Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Q
Thanks for that, Mike. And then Ken, in terms of free cash flows, good free cash flow quarter but was wondering, 
any call outs for next quarter for the cadence for the year? You did mention the seasonality in the Q1. I heard you 
say that, but anything else we should be aware of in terms of the cash flow?

Yeah. No, I don't think there's anything, Jamie. I mean I think the second quarter should be a good cash flow 
quarter and I think the rest of the year as well. So, I think we're heading into kind of more cash generation going 
forward.

Thanks, Jamie. Kelly Ann, next question?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: That will be from Brad with BMO.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley Clark
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to start off asking about the Application (sic) [Applications] (43:05) 
business within GBS and sort of the expected trajectory there, if it could perhaps flatten out to where it's sort of 
flat on growth versus being sort of a detrimented growth. I know you mentioned the demand within broader DBS 
and obviously within Analytics & Engineering. But could you hone in on what your sort of view is for that business 
and how it fits in strategically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Well, okay, well, strategically, it's key part of what we're doing in GBS. And to break that business apart, right, 
there's really four pieces. There's a custom application. That's where we just build stuff from the ground up for 
clients, which we're really good at. There's an SAP Enterprise piece, there's an Oracle piece, and then there's a 
ServiceNow.
And what we do is we do all four of those for clients. The demand that we're seeing is particularly in custom apps, 
SAP and ServiceNow. So that negative [ph] 2% (44:10) was negative [ph] 2% (44:11) last quarter as well. And we 
do see that flattening out, all right, throughout the year but that's a good business for us.
And again, what we're leaning into is really the custom build and the reason why the custom build is – we're so 
good at that is because once you're running that infrastructure, you put the infrastructure with the applications. 
Typically, our engineers can develop good stuff. So that's a good business for us. Don't lose sight of the fact that 
the performance of that is going to be just fine. Brad, do you have another?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bradley Clark
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
[ph] Okay, thank you. (44:53) And then just a – yeah, just a quick follow-up for Ken on the free cash flow. I believe 
you said it's reflective of the margin sort of cadence of the region for the $100 million difference. Can you just 
perhaps talk about the FX impact and how we should be thinking about that forward through to free cash flow?

You mentioned [ph] more stream (45:17) on margins and revenue and just want to make sure I have that –
understand it. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth P. Sharp
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, DXC Technology Co. A
Yeah. No, appreciate the question, Brad. We have about kind of a ballpark $800 million more in cost than US 
dollars when you look at it kind of on a pro rata basis. And so therefore, when the dollar strengthens like it has, it's 
caused not only the revenue dollars and profit dollars to come down. It's caused margin compression as well and 
that's what's really impacting the margin in addition just to the dollars coming down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Kelly Ann, let's take the next question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. That will come from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lisa D. Ellis
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC Q
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Mike, I just wanted to ask. This is a follow-up on the bookings dynamic and what 
you're talking about, about pricing those deals in a different way. Are there investments that you're making or 
you're realizing you need to make in your sales team and the go-to-market model to be able to sell this way to sort 
of shift to selling more value or sort of a different value proposition perhaps than they've done before? Or is this –
do you view it just like literally very temporary with this quarter and once you get [ph] your job (46:43) closed 
you're kind of off to the races or is it something that requires a bit more investment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Well, I mean, look, it is something that's systemic that we're putting in place in terms of DXC. So – and it's not 
about, right, the sales folks. I mean it's about our reviews of those deals and we got to be clear that we can hit 
those margins instead of hoping in the future that some things are going to happen, okay?
And Lisa, as you know, those deals come to us, all right, with a certain price expectation because that's the price 
they've been paying for several deals now or several years now. As you know, those deals are a lot of times 5, 
10, 15 years old that these folks have been running those things. So, the clients are coming to us with a specific 
price for scope.
And what we're doing is sitting down and taking them back through the scope, taking them back through. Here's 
why that was probably under bid and then here's how we're going to deliver it for you. And then obviously, we 
stack that up with the references that we have in the market so that they can hear from those references that we 
do deliver because that's where those folks are at now. They've had enough fun with the people that they've been 
dealing with. There's too much uncertainty as it relates to what's going to happen with their company and so forth.
And that's why I keep coming back. I know it sounds cliché, but the quality of company that we've built, that's 
leading us to take on these new inquiries. So, it's not so much what the sales team is doing. It's literally the 
operating committee that I've established, reviewing those deals and making sure we're not going to do them at a 
lower price.

And if I need to get on these calls and say, hey, the book-to-bill was [ph] 27, (48:41) do I really like to do that? No. 
But I also don't like when the margin's going backwards, all right, especially on the new work. So as you can see, 
Lisa, not only are we fixing the delivery model, but making sure we're shutting off the funnel coming in that the 
deals should help us get to that 10% to 11% margin in FY 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lisa D. Ellis
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC Q
Okay. Okay. And then my follow-up is on GIS and apologies, I'm doing this out of my memory so I might have it 
wrong, but my recollection is that when you initially set the 2024 outlook, your expectation for GIS was to get it to 
flattish or maybe modestly down and it's still running three quarters out at minus 7% or so. So, can you just help 
us a bit? GBS is humming along as you've highlighted very nicely, but can you help us a bit with sort of how we 
should think about bridging GIS over the next year or so to get to that 2024 number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co. A
Okay. Lisa, thanks for the comments on GBS because obviously, I'm very happy with that business, too. Look, 
taking the – or narrowing the decline of GIS by 80 basis points, you're starting to see it's heading in the right 
direction because we literally have stacked up the last three quarters at minus 8%, minus 8.3%, minus 8%. So 
literally breaking through that number and starting to push it down is solely focused on one thing and one thing 
only, and that's the performance of Modern Workplace, okay?
And it's not that hard of an equation. As Modern Workplace has gone from, I think, it was minus 19% last quarter 
to minus 16% this quarter, we've been very clear that we expect that that business is turned around. We have 
new work coming on. We're seeing the work come on. As Modern Workplace gets fixed, so does GIS. It's literally 
that simple.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lisa D. Ellis

Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.

Michael J. Salvino

Operator: At this time, Mike, I'd like to turn things back to you for closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael J. Salvino
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, DXC Technology Co.
All right. Kelly Ann, thanks so much. Look, in closing, what I would tell you is that we've made some very good 
short-term decisions around investing in DXC. We think those are going to position us well in the future. I'm very 
proud of the quality of company and the quality of customer relationships that we've built. And the closing 
comment is we are laser-focused on making sure we take out this $500 million. And we've got a team of operators 
that is very good and we've got high confidence like we did in FY 2021 that we will take the cost out again.
So with that, we'll close the call and I look forward to updating everybody in the fall on Q2. Kelly Ann, you can 
close the call.

Question and Answer
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Thank you, Spencer, and good afternoon, everyone. So maybe, Spence, we could start off with you, just
given the guidance and the beat during the quarter relative to guidance. Sequentially, the first quarter
tends to be higher in net additions than Q4. But your guidance is lower despite the fact that you beat Q4
by a relatively large amount. And it feels like the pull-forward effect is more or less behind us. So if you
could just help us walk through the thought behind the guidance and the framework that you used for
that, that would be a good place to start.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Yes, sure, Kannan. Well, great to see you. Happy new year, obviously delayed. So in terms of the guide,
first of all, we guided to 6 million paid net adds for Q1, if you saw. And obviously, that's still a big number,
especially when you think about it in context of 2020, which was, by far, a record year with 37 million paid
net adds.
So I know you mentioned the pull-forward. I don't think we're declaring that we're necessarily through
that yet. So we think there's puts and calls every quarter. But one that's still a meaningful factor for us in
the guide is thinking through how we kind of grow through that growth from 2020. So there's probably
still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021.
And then more broadly, Kannan, it's just so difficult in this time. I mean this is one of the more uniquely
challenging times not just for life but -- that's most important but also obviously in terms of trying to just
forecast the growth trajectory of the business. There's just so much uncertainty right now. So it's more
uncertain than we've ever seen, and we're trying to forecast through that.
But at the same time, one thing that's maybe counterbalancing that is that what COVID has done for that
is it's accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment. So the long-term growth trajectory
is at least as strong as ever. There's just more short-term noise and uncertainty right now but still very
strong underlying growth metrics, and that's what you're seeing in the Q1 guide.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
I guess if you just look at the full year in terms of cadence, '21, obviously, has tough comps versus 2020.
But I think one of the things you guys also indicated was potentially a 4 million to 5 million pull-forward
into 2020 from a growth perspective. And I think there's been a lot of debate about what you actually
meant by that 4 million to 5 million. So if you could just contextualize the guidance for Q1 more in the
context of 2021. You typically do 28 million, 30 million subs in a given year. Is that framework more or
less intact? Or should we read that 4 million to 5 million comment as a pull-forward into '20?
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Well, look, I'll take this one. Others can jump in as well. Unfortunately, Kannan, we're just -- we're not
going to provide a full year guide. I mean just as we talked about, there's so much uncertainty in the
business. We can provide a number, but I'm not sure it would be worth -- it would be bankable, right?
I mean it's hard enough to project the next 90 days, let alone the next 12 months. What we feel very
good about, as I said, is that longer-term growth trajectory. You've seen, as you pointed out, the historical
growth trends. Hopefully, it will be plus or minus that, but it's a bit impossible to predict.
What we do see is that viewing is up in every region of the world. It's kind of returned from those
peak COVID levels, but it's up year-over-year in all regions. Retention is better than it was a year ago.

Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business, but I don't want to provide
false precision on a 12-month target.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. And if you could touch on a couple of regions, I mean, the one thing that stood out during the
quarter, of course, is UCAN, where most of us thought the market was saturated but you guys keep
accelerating growth despite price increases, which is even more impressive, and then the other region
which until Q3 seems to be -- despite the benefit of COVID seemed to have slower growth than 2019
despite the market not being saturated. So if you could just talk about the underlying trends in some of
these markets and what you're seeing, which is driving some of these trends, that might be useful.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Do you want me to go or someone else want to go?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Okay. I'll go again, Kannan. I think the story is pretty similar throughout the world. Every country is a
little bit different. But what we're seeing in terms of our viewing trends are similar around the world. The
types of content that our members are viewing is kind of similar pre-COVID and post-COVID. Obviously,
we have more and more variety of content and great experiences that we're offering to our members. But
the story is pretty similar.
As you know, there are certain countries around the world where we're just further along in our content
market fit and our maturation, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean even -- like you pick Latin
America as an example, one of our more mature markets. You look over the past few years, and we've
been steadily growing about 5 million to 6 million paid net adds a year. As you mentioned, in the kind of
U.S., UCAN market, we're roughly 60% penetrated, and we're still growing. So we're still a very small
share of even just pay-TV penetration in most markets around the world and small share of viewing. So
we think we've got a lot of headroom in all these markets, and we're just trying to get a little better every
day.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And Kannan, if you take the U.S. being our most penetrated market, we're still under 10% of television
viewing time as Netflix. So again, there -- we've got a lot of subscribers here in the U.S., but we still have
a lot more viewing time that we would like to earn with an embeddable service and embeddable content.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. And Spence, maybe one last financial question and we'll get this out of the way and get into the
more interesting part of the discussion. But...
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
I won't take offense to that last comment, Kannan.
Kannan Venkateshwar

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
But the one thing, obviously, which is new in the letter this quarter is the cash flow guidance, and
your cash flow guidance is better than what you guys initially indicated and the buyback guidance. So
maybe you could talk about capital allocation and using the cash for buybacks versus potentially other
opportunities. And also, why use an absolute gross debt number instead of a leverage target to frame the
buyback discussion? So it would be helpful to get that context.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Yes, sure. So thanks, Kannan. We're super proud of where we are from a free cash flow perspective. And
we talked a bit internally before the call as to what was a bigger milestone for us to pass the 200 million
member mark or kind of turning to this next chapter in terms of our free cash flow and the ability to selffund our growth going forward. And we think that's a pretty big milestone for us.
To the point of our capital allocation approach, the philosophy remains unchanged, which is that we're
going to be disciplined stewards of the capital and try to do things that we believe are value maximizing
for our shareholders. But we have turned this corner where now we can, as we talked about with $8
billion of cash on the balance sheet, projecting to be cash flow about breakeven in 2021 and then positive
thereafter. We want to return excess cash to our shareholders.
So we won't build up a bunch of excess cash. We'll maintain, as you say, about -- as we said in the letter,
and as you mentioned, about $10 billion to $15 billion of gross debt on the balance sheet. And that's really
just to maintain familiarity and access to the debt markets should we need it, but there's really not a
whole lot of science beyond that.
And then beyond, as I say, we're -- we put a premium on balance sheet flexibility. So we're going to
continue to invest aggressively into the growth opportunities that we see. And that's always going to come
first. But beyond that, if we have excess cash, we'll return it to shareholders through a share buyback
program.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And Reed and Ted, if we could just pivot to a question on competition. I mean this question may feel a
little bit unfair, to be honest, because in many ways, you created the streaming template for others to
replicate. But given Disney's recent success and the kind of numbers they are putting up, it almost feels
like Netflix is underachieving versus its potential and has to work a lot harder to get to comparable scale.
So are there any reasons why the Disney numbers are not a benchmark for Netflix and why you got -- the
company can't get there?
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Underachieving, Kannan, I mean, if you look at our financials, in the bottom of our earnings, which is the
return -- the annualized return over 18 years being 40%, so if that's underperformance, we'll do more of
that.
Look, it's super impressive what Disney has done. I mean it's the incredible execution for an incumbent
to pivot and taking on an insurgent. And so that's great. And it shows that members are interested and
willing to pay more for more content because they're hungry for great stories, and Disney does have some
great stories. And so it gets us fired up about increasing our membership, increasing our content budget.
And it's going to be great for the world that Disney and Netflix are competing show by show, movie by
movie. And we're very fired up about catching them in family animation, maybe eventually passing them,
we'll see, a long way to go just to catch them, and maintaining our lead in general entertainment that's so
stimulating like Bridgerton, which I don't think you're going to see on Disney anytime soon.
Ted, do you want to follow up on that?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director

No, I think when you talk about it in competitive terms, you think about Christmas Day 2020 where you
have an enormously anticipated film like Wonder Woman '84 and Soul both debuting on competitive
services and us launching what turns out to be one of our biggest launches ever. And I do think what
Reed said is that it does point to people have tremendously big appetite for great entertainment and all
different kinds of it. And the fact that they're willing to pay more for more programming, I think, is very
encouraging.
We've always said that people will -- our goal is we want to make everybody's favorite show, everybody's
favorite film. Other people are going to try to do that, too, and people will supplement their Netflix
subscription to get that content, which I think is a super healthy dynamic.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And Kannan, if I -- sorry, go ahead, Greg.
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
I'm sorry, but if I could just add as well, I think there's the membership lens in the number of subscribers.
But it's also useful to look at it from a revenue lens, which, of course, is the fuel that we have to basically
create more of that content to get that virtuous cycle flowing more.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
And the only other thing I would add to that, Kannan, not to get too in the weeds on the numbers and
not to take anything away at all from what Disney has done because it's been amazing, and I'm a happy
customer myself, but 30% of their, I think, 87 million paid subscribers were Hotstar, which I think we
all sort of recognize as a bit of a different service. So that's -- sort of 87 million is closer to 60 million,
and our ARPU is roughly double or actually more than double. So we added close to 40 million last year
alone. So I think when you factor in those dynamics and the fact that we're coming from a higher level of
penetration globally, I think we feel very good about the performance.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
So you took the bait. Can I just try to get us the [ chest pound ] some more?
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
I don't mean to be provocative. It turned out to be just -- but just a follow-up. And Greg, I guess you're
going to have a lot to say on this topic. But when you think about Disney coming in or even Discovery or
all these new launches that are happening, in some ways, this expands the pie quite a bit for streaming in
general because there are also new distribution models that are being attempted. And telecom companies
have started to see this as a new normal. And my guess is this will be to all kinds of other permutations
in the future. So when you think about more streaming services coming out over the course of '21, does
that, in some way, provide an opportunity to try new distribution avenues or accelerate growth because of
the growth in streaming in some ways?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Well, I think you're right. I mean we're seeing this big macro shift. And certainly, the global pandemic has
accelerated that process. And really, I think the first bit is just even that big impetus to move is, to some
degree, a tailwind for us because we have more and more consumers who are -- around the world who
are aware of these services. We have more and more intention, more activity out there.

We are seeking to be innovative and constantly pushing the edges around how we can accelerate our
growth, how we can improve our distribution footprint, how do we access members more and more. And
also -- and what's really the key engine of our growth is just how do we satisfy those folks that have
signed up for us because that really is the ultimate stimulus, when they have a great experience and
they talk wildly about how great the service is, how amazing the titles that they're viewing there to their
friends, their families, their colleagues, that's really what motivates that next round of subscribers to sign
up.
So we'll keep pushing the edges. We seek to be innovative in that way, and we'll come up with many
creative ideas we can to grow.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
All right. And I guess extending on that topic, you ran a couple of interesting experiments during the
quarter. I think Netflix was free in India for a weekend. And in France, you have tried the linear format. So
could you talk a little bit about the learnings from these experiments? And are these successful enough to
expand to other regions?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. So StreamFest in India, I mean the primary learning, which is very evident, is that there's a lot of
interest amongst consumers in India to try Netflix. We had millions of people that had access for a 48-
hour period to the service. And now we go through the more difficult part of actually analyzing how that
interest through the specific tactic translates into sustained incremental growth. And we're still working
through the details of that. And obviously, based on what we see there, we'll inform how we think about
how we leverage that tactic again or how do we improve on it, what are places we think it might be
leverageable.
And then on -- to your other point, I think Netflix members come to the service seeking to be entertained
in a whole variety of ways. Sometimes they're looking for a movie or sometimes a TV show or animation
or scripted or unscripted. And sometimes they show up and they're not really sure what they want to
watch. And so we've had the opportunity to try and be innovative and try new mechanisms to sort of help
our members in that particular state.
So there's -- the linear feed is one example of that. It's still unclear how that's going to work out. So
we're still looking at that one. But I think an even better example of that is a new feature that we've been
testing and we're going to now roll out globally because it's really working for us, where our members can
basically indicate to us that they just want to skip browsing entirely, click one button and we'll pick a title
for them just to instantly play. And that's a great mechanism that's worked quite well for our members in
that situation.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Greg, are we going to call it, "I'm feeling lucky"? Or are you going to come up with something better?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
We're going to come up with something better than that. So stand by for the specific verbiage. You'll see
when it rolls out.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And so Greg, just following up on Asia a little bit more. You mentioned the $4 billion to $5 billion in
revenues that Netflix has been able to add over the last few years. As EMEA becomes a bigger region and
as your reliance on growth in that region increases, is that $4 billion to $5 billion the right way to think
NETFLIX, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 19, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
about revenue growth? And also -- and because of the ARPU, of course, in that region being much lower,
how should we think about that framework for revenue growth going forward?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. I mean we're proud of the sustained $4 billion to $5 billion annual revenue growth, which we think
is unprecedented in the entertainment industry. And certainly, our aspirations are to do as well as we can
and growing -- continue to grow that revenue.
But to your point, specifically, what we're seeing is we have to find ways to improve the accessibility of the
Netflix service. And oftentimes, that means doing some trade-offs between subscriber growth at different
ASPs. But really our framework for all of that and the way we assess the moves that we make and how we
expand those moves and when we test, how we evaluate those tests is really around that sort of revenue
optimization piece. And so that's always the lens that we get to, and we're going to use that to continue to
try and basically fuel as much revenue growth as we can.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
And I would just add to that, Kannan, just in this past quarter, the APAC region was the second largest
contributor to growth. And you see the kind of revenue acceleration, frankly, that's happening in our
business from about $4 billion increase over the total year -- 2 years ago to about $5 billion this year. And
even just in our guidance for Q1, it's, I think, 24% year-over-year. So on an absolute basis, that revenue
is growing.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And when you think about the APAC region, I mean, obviously, that's -- that region is very different in
terms of price sensitivity and the kind of diversity the region has, languages and so on and so forth. So
when you approach that particular region, is the present model more or less the steady state of trying a
mobile-only kind of a plan and then trying to upgrade people from there? Or are there other things you
can do either in terms of pricing or product to potentially accelerate that?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
There are 100 things that we can and we need to go do, and we know that it's really not about just one
trick or one thing that will basically make us successful in the region. But it's just constantly looking at
all of the ways at which the current product experience doesn't satisfy completely our members, our
members to be.
And you mentioned language. It's a great one where even simple things like we're improving the ability
for our members to tell us what languages they want in terms of the content when they're browsing.
And there are sort of these different scenarios. There's a scenario maybe when you're by yourself and if
you're multilingual, that can result in sort of different choices. If you're in a multigenerational household,
then all of a sudden, that might shift how you think about like what titles you want to present and what
language it is. And so that's just one small example of places where we know we can improve the product
experience and be more effective and satisfying members.
But it goes on and on from that to like the methods of payments that we know we need to expand, and
we're constantly working to add more of those and make those more effective, the partnerships we have
that make the service more accessible and more immediate, easier for members to find out and sign up.
So there's tons of things that we're looking at.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
Okay. And speaking of an area of overachievement instead of underachievement, 70 movies in a year. So
now you guys are the industry in many ways. I think the top 5 studios potentially do about 90 movies a
year. You guys are doing 70 a year. So at what point is this too much? How do you judge that balance?
And how are you juggling? Or how are you evaluating returns on this investment?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
It's likely more than 70. That's just what we were able to talk about in that last release, in that exciting
trailer. I mean you think about it as you think about how diverse people's tastes are, you think about the
appetite to watch a movie. It isn't just one a week. I think there's plenty of room to grow that. But -- and
we're doing that at a much larger scale today.
So thinking about movie stars like Gal Gadot and Leonardo DiCaprio and Meryl Streep and filmmakers like
Jane Campion and Adam McKay, Zack Snyder, Antoine Fuqua making films at enormous scale for Netflix so
that when people have an appetite to watch a movie, they can do it at home and they could do it on a big
screen or they could do it on their phone. And I just think that, that evolution will continue to grow and
expand well beyond a movie a week because that's -- we're talking about serving a global audience with
incredibly diverse taste.
So that one a week is -- in many weeks, it's already 2 or 3. And some of them are hugely impactful in the
region that they're created for, and some of them become very, very global, like we saw with #Alive last
year with -- from Korea, which became a very big hit for us around the world.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And when you make these titles, I mean, you innovated with respect to the kind of financial model on
content creation with a cost-plus kind of a structure relative to the deficit finance models in the past for
content. When you do the kind of output that you're doing and the volumes that you're doing, is there
a risk that this leads to lower returns over time because there is really no downside, in some ways, for
studios to create this content on a cost-plus basis? And does it make sense at this scale versus when you
were essentially doing originals as a start-up?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I think it does. I mean we're seeing it scale up more than double every year and continuing to scale
both in the scope of the projects, the ambition of the projects and the execution of the projects. And I
do think the financial return, if you think about it relative on a handful of titles that wind up doing an
enormous return for the studio versus the hundreds of titles that barely breakeven, this is a great model
for producers to produce in. And the fact that we can support it day in and day out at this kind of volume
and make projects that are otherwise pretty difficult to make, in some cases, has been really encouraging
for filmmakers to embrace this model.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Got it. And given the kind of volumes that you're doing on movies now and also because of COVID, there's
been a significant shift in the release patterns for movie not just at Netflix but across the industry, does
this, in some ways, create essentially a new distribution channel for you? If day and date releases or
shorter windows become more acceptable, does it become possible for you to essentially tap the box office
with wider releases on a very short window? And does that become a new revenue stream at some point?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Kannan, potentially, I mean, we've looked at this before. We've never had any issue with movies being in
theaters. Our biggest issue has been that you had to commit to this very long window of exclusivity to get
access to any theaters. That's been the biggest challenge. So if those windows are going to collapse and
NETFLIX, INC. FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 19, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
we'd have easier access to films to show our films in theaters, I'd love to have consumers be able to make
the choice between seeing it out or seeing it at home, which is becoming the norm in -- during COVID,
certainly. And we'll see how much that sticks.
But I think that consumer behavior, human behavior, things change a lot over time. But there's a very
different experience associated with going out and going to the theater with strangers and seeing a movie,
and it's fantastic. It's just not core to our business.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Hopefully, with Warner Bros. sort of COVID move, what we'll see is post-COVID, like the second half of the
year, is that people both go to the theaters in significant numbers and watch their films and their premier
simultaneously on HBO Max. And then that will really set a path where simultaneous is good for the film,
helps both online and on streaming and then also in the theaters. But we have to wait to post-COVID to
get a clean read of that.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Yes. So what you're seeing today, though, is exactly what we've been trying to do for a couple of years
since we're making these films at this size.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
I guess the other side of this coin is, given your distribution scale now, if a studio wanted to release a
movie on Netflix, this is one of the most efficient channels they can get to. Why is that not an attractive
model for Netflix, either in the form of a premium VOD channel or some other distribution model? But why
is that not an attractive model for you?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I'm not -- we're not saying that it isn't. What we're saying is this one has been the most attractive model.
So in terms of -- both for consumers and for our own business.
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
And then, Kannan, I think you alluded maybe to a different model, sort of a transactional kind of
approach. And I would say that we really believe that from a consumer orientation, the simplicity of our
ad-free, no additional payments, one subscription, it's really, really powerful and really, really satisfying
the consumers around the world. And so we want to keep emphasizing that.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
It's interesting when you challenge the people to figure out, one of the great things about the subscription
model is I think it opens up for consumers to be much more adventurous about what they watch. So I
think you can throw out a lot of preconceived notions about what works and what doesn't because those
are mostly established by business trends, not by consumer trends.
And what -- so I think what happens is people say, "Hey, I don't watch foreign language television, but
I've heard of this show called Lupin and I'm super excited to see it. And it's included in my subscription
by push play." And 10 minutes later, all of a sudden, they like foreign language television. So it's a really
incredible evolution.
Bong Joon-ho said it so beautifully at the Oscars, that audiences have to get over the 1-inch wall to enjoy
a whole another world of entertainment. And we're seeing that at incredible scale already by watching --

by having great stories from anywhere in the world to everywhere in the world on Netflix. And that 1-inch
wall is the subtitles or you can watch it with dubs or you can watch it in the original language track.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And I guess when you have this kind of content volume and also the kind of movie slate that you're
putting up, it also gives you a lot more pricing power because instead of watching a movie for $10 or as a
family for $30, you essentially pay for Netflix. So your pricing power implicitly goes up in this environment
because of the kind of product.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
So we're increasing value. We're increasing the value proposition for the consumer. Every time we get
another 10 minutes of watching on Netflix, you're increasing the value of that subscription. So I think it's
-- by increasing the options, we are also increasing the likeliness that you're going to push play. And when
you do push play, you're going to love what you see.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And Kannan, realistically, out-of-home entertainment, it's just most consumers think of that differently,
just like you could cook cheaply but people still go out to dinner. And they still go out and they see that
as an experience that's just different. So don't think of that as the direct -- or our members don't think
of that as the direct comp. But what they love is for a low price, they get to watch an unlimited amount
and be very experimental, back to what Ted was saying in their taste and to try Alice in Borderland and
to try Lupin. So it's -- all these things are kind of interconnected to be able to create a really unique and
incredible viewing experience.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Right. So I guess when you think about these factors, I mean, there are 2 ways to think about pricing
in this environment. One is when you have so much competition and consumer wallets essentially have
to be spread more widely. One way to read the environment is to say that pricing power is limited. But
then on the other side of it, your share of total engagement could continue to go up and the pie itself
could increase. And you have more product which consumers -- basically, that wallet is coming out of
somewhere else instead of television. Which of these 2 dynamics should we expect to see? In other words,
should pricing power accelerate or ARPU growth accelerate in the coming years, at least in the Western
markets?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. I would say our competition set we think of is extremely broad, whether you think about it as share of
wallet or share of time and attention, share of entertainment, share of delight. And we feel like we have so
much more room to growth and -- to grow. And really, it's exciting to now see the sort of new dimensions
of value creation for our users, like bringing a foreign language show, Lupin, Casa de Papel, shows that
are now becoming global hits from countries and in languages. That's never happened before. So that's
super exciting to see that kind of value creation. And that's really just where we stay focused.
So we're not trying to predict the future in that way but just stay tightly, tightly disciplined on trying to
think about what's that next incremental step where we can create more value for our members, engage
them, delight them, more great content, more great product experiences. And if we think we do that well,
then we think our business will grow in turn.

And Kannan, we've been pretty cautious and we'll continue to be pretty cautious.
So maybe Spencer Wang, can you remember the -- what's -- the last 3 years, what's happened with
average revenue per member, what's it moved up from?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. So it's moved up from less than $10. It's around sort of $9.90 per month per membership to, in
the last quarter, slightly north of $11. And just bear in mind, Kannan, I think you know this, but we had
significant FX headwinds over that course of time, too. So we've seen that grow steadily. So that's, I think,
a helpful framework for you.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Yes. It's about 10% over 3 years. So pretty cautious, and it's working well for us to provide incredible
value.
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. And maybe just another way of stating [ that cautious ] is just thinking about it. We do think we're an
incredible entertainment value, and we want to remain incredible entertainment value.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Yes. And I draw you back to the Christmas Day releases where we had Bridgerton. But a couple of days
before that, we have Midnight Sky. And a couple of days after that, we had Cobra Kai. And a couple of
days after that, we had Lupin. And a couple of days after that, we had Pieces of a Woman. I mean it's a
phenomenal -- and you can see -- and the numbers are in front of you. The way that people have enjoyed
these series and films has been unprecedented. And I think the rhythm and the pace of that has been
really keeping up. And I think that is the definition of consumer value.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
And just the recent data points, Kannan, we referenced in the letter, but we had price increases in the
U.S. in the fourth quarter. We announced in the U.K. in December. And we've grown nicely through that
because I think to this point, we're continuing to increase the variety and value of what we're delivering
for our members.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And I guess on the pricing front, I mean, at a certain level, the elasticity -- and there's some action a
research on this. But essentially, elasticity seems to be a function of the price itself, which means as you
go higher and higher, when you start taking price up, potentially maybe the elasticity of demand changes.
But is that something that you guys have seen yet? Or are we still very far away from that point at which
these factors kick in for you? So if you could just talk about what you've seen so far as you've taken
price up across different regions in terms of potentially churn or cohort behavior, that might be a useful
framework for us.
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. And I think rather than sort of that academic perspective, we look at it perhaps more practically and
more operationally. And really, it's almost reversing it, which is that we are looking for signals and signs
from our members that are telling us essentially that we have added more value.

So you think about engagement with the service and retention and churn characteristics, acquisition.
Those are the things that we're really looking for that are key to basically saying, okay, we've added more
value in the service. Now it's the right time to go back to those members and ask them to pay a little bit
more so that we can reinvest it and keep adding it. So it's really that sort of iterative feel our way forward
kind of orientation that we have.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Got it. Pivoting to a slightly different topic. You guys added Strive Masiyiwa, I hope I'm pronouncing that
right, to the Board. And Africa is not a region we've discussed in the past, but Disney started creating a
lot of content in the region. And obviously, this Board appointment is pretty interesting. Is this the next
focus? How should we think about this as an opportunity?
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Well, Strive is a global board member. He's not coming on board to be a marketing consultant for
Africa, although he does know it extremely well. But he's a voice about how to build large subscription
businesses, which he's done. He's enormously sophisticated at dealing with governments, which, as we
grow, is an increasingly important skill for us to have.
So think of him as a great global advocate for us. He also knows Europe very well and the rest of the
world reasonably well. So I think it's -- we've been broadening our global board membership, and it's
a continuation of that. And again, Africa has a ton of potential. We're doing more content there. We're
growing our membership. But again, that's not Strive's role specifically.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And just looking at the rest of the world, I mean there's been a lot of small transactions. And Spencer,
this one might be for you, and I'm sure the others will chime in as well. But there have been a couple of
streaming services in Southeast Asia, which essentially were acquired by some of the Chinese Internet
majors. Sony, of course, did the acquisition of Crunchyroll. So there's been interesting assets which could
have helped you scale potentially faster but obviously passed on it or did not really show any interest in
these assets. So could you help us think through what kind of assets you guys would care about? Is it
more like the Millarworld assets? Or why are these assets not interesting?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. To answer the first question, Kannan, with respect to other streaming services, our view is many
people subscribe to multiple different services. So acquiring another one just for their members doesn't
really help us. And we wanted to stay focused on capturing and earning that subscription from each
person organically rather than just doing some sort of M&A deal. So that's sort of point one.
Point two, in terms of your other question around what are we interested in, it is largely around things
that can help us bolster our core business, which is entertainment and specifically content assets inclusive
of things like intellectual property that we can hopefully turn into great TV shows and great movies.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I would just add that historically, we've been builders, not buyers. And years ago, I used to try to get the
team to wrap their head around the potential scale of the business by saying things like someday we'll be
so big, we'll have a VP of anime. And then some days now, we're one of the largest producers of anime in
the world.
So you think about those kind of things now, and it's like what would you -- when you look at those
assets, they're primarily distribution assets, not really IP assets. So that's -- and we've been taking the

approach like with our unscripted programming, with our anime, with our animated features, with the big
budget original film, we're building over a couple of years versus acquiring.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
We have time for one more question, please.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Got it. Spencer, maybe -- sorry, Reed, I'll ask you this final question more with respect to the longerterm outlook for the business. And Ted, obviously, feel free to chime in as well on this one. But is there
any regrets you guys have had in terms of things that you guys could have done but did not do? And one
instance that comes to mind is something like Roku, if it was part of the company instead of being spun
out. And also when you look at the competitive landscape, what do you perceive as the real competition?
Is it streaming services? Or does it come from outside, from things like Fortnite, which you've mentioned
in the past as an engagement driver for consumers?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Reed?
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
I think it was directed to Spencer. So I was going to -- I was going to see how he answers this one.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
I could take a stab at it. I mean -- and then I'll pass it over to Reed and/or Ted. Look, we -- as Greg
mentioned earlier, we think the competitive set is incredibly large and wide. And so look, I think we have
a lot of work to do to continue to grow that small share of screening time that we have today to hopefully
become more and more valuable to our members.
I think the other part of your question was, is there anything that we sort of regret. I've only been here
5.5 years compared to Greg, Reed and Ted who have been here much, much longer. So I think about
window of regret is probably smaller. So I don't think that there's anything that jumps out to mind right
now.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Spencer's regret is not joining 3 years earlier.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
He could have.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
That is correct.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
No, not materially. I mean I think it is fantastic that we've executed. If we had kept Roku inside, it's very
unlikely they would have been the success that they have. What Anthony and his team have done has

taken enormous energy and focus on their side. And it was an enormous test for us just to become a
leader in both streaming and then original programming and then global. So I -- we're happy for their
success, but no regrets on that front.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Got it.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I think for the -- with the hours and hours of joy we're bringing to hundreds of millions of people around
the world and with the return to our shareholders, it's hard to look back with much regret.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Here is one for you, Kannan. We regret not buying a global license to House of Cards in the first deal that
we had to go back in piecemeal of that extraordinary expense.
Kannan Venkateshwar
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
That's a good note to end on, I guess.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Thank you, Kannan, and thank you to all of our shareholders, and look forward to talking to you in another
quarter.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks to all.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Thanks, Kannan. Thanks, guys.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Happy new year.

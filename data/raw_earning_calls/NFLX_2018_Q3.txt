PRESENTATION
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q3 2018 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me
today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this
quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS.
As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary.
With that, over to you now, Eric, for the first question.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Thank you, Spencer. Maybe I'll kick off with what clearly is the headline from the earnings results, much better subscriber performance in Q3 and
a fairly robust guide within Q4 in terms of looking out over subscribers. I'll throw it to you guys to sort of lay out the framework you saw develop
in Q3, what do you think might develop in Q4 that was different than what happened earlier in the year?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Eric, I think we're getting a little better on the forecasting, in particular the evolution to paid net adds. So if you look at that paid net add growth
that we showed, you can see how remarkably steady. So I'm afraid the Q2, Q3 story is probably mostly an issue of forecasting as opposed to anything
changing in the business. And you can see the noise that the free trials added into the paid, which gets you the total creates. So I think by focusing
going forward on paid, we'll be able to be a little more accurate and focus on the fundamentals.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
So when you think about some of the distribution deals you've done over the last couple of years, that's creating some noise that I think you're
now trying to clear up with these new disclosures. But can you also talk a little bit about what those distribution deals may be in terms of opening
up pockets of the market that haven't been available to you before not only just this year but as you think out longer term about the business?

OCTOBER 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q3 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Sure. Over to you, Greg.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
And can you clarify, Eric, in distribution deals you mean the device partners, et cetera?
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Correct. Different ways of going to market via partner as opposed to direct.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Yes. So I think what we're doing is we're slowly learning more and more about how we can leverage partners. We've seen it sort of an evolution
from just doing device integrations into things like billing integration so we can make it that much easier for our members to sign up for the service.
This latest round we're seeing now is bundling where whether we're bundling with an internet service provider or a mobile operator or a pay-TV
operator, we can make it even easier for people to just find Netflix and to try the service out. And what we're seeing here is that this allows us to
access a set of subscribers, a consumer demographic which might be less technology early adopter than the folks that are signing us up -- with us
directly. And so we're able to sort of accelerate our growth in a new segment via these deals. So we're learning more and more about that. We're
trying to figure out which markets they work and how to optimize that bundle strategy.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
And Eric, I would say these aren't new disclosures in the sense that, that's pretty strong term. I would say this is an evolution of a partner strategy.
And as Greg talked about, we've been doing many of these for a while. There's nothing sort of strategically different than what we've been doing
for the last 5 years or so.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
So maybe following up on something that Greg said there, just where you're discovering growth and awareness of the product that didn't exist
before. I would like to separate that into domestic versus international. And I think one of the questions we get from investors all the time are,
where is the growth coming from in North America, given the brand's awareness that -- given how long the brand's been around in the marketplace,
anything you could tell us about where those pockets of growth are and where you're discovering new awareness for the company.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
I'd say even in America, where the awareness is super high and the brand is well understood, there's still pockets of consumers who it's harder for
them to get the activation actually to go directly to the website and sign up. But if we can actually put a Netflix application, a call to action and
maybe even bundle the service subscription as part of their pay-TV offering or the mobile offering, they can just click on something and then get
right into the service. And so even for a place where we're well known, we make it easier, more effective for folks to sign up. We see actual acceleration
of adds there. Then obviously in markets where we're less well understood in terms of what the offering is, that simplifying, that making it less
friction full provides other types of members maybe that are even more technology adopters, simple ways just to try to experience out, and we
get the growth there as well. So I wouldn't say it's -- we're seeing the sort of the same dynamic which is you remove friction, and it works both in
high-penetration, the high-awareness markets as well as the lower-penetration, lower-awareness markets.

OCTOBER 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q3 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
One of the other things -- sticking with the domestic market for a minute, pricing power in the business model. You raised prices as we came out
of last year and into this year. It's now been a couple of quarters as some of those pricing actions have worked through the marketplace. What have
you learned about the value that consumers put on Netflix? And how much pricing power there might be in the business model especially when
you look domestically?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
I think, we're just -- what we're seeing is just reinforcing the sort of core theory that we have, which is our job is to focus on, invest in providing our
members incredible experiences, more great content, great product experiences. And when we do that and we do it well, we earn the right to
increase price a bit, and then we take that new revenue and invest it back into the model. And that sort of continuous positive cycle, we get to
keep going. And we foresee that, that will keep going for many years in the future.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe pivoting back to international, I'd love to talk about both India and non-India. Within India, we saw a big push earlier this year into local
language content. I'd love to talk a little bit about what local language content does in India to stimulate subscriber growth and how you think
about penetrating the India market from who you need to partner with and how you have to get pricing right over the medium to long term. So
I'll throw that open maybe to -- it probably touches upon a little bit of everyone within the group.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
I could -- this is Ted. I'll talk to you about -- we had incredible success with Sacred Games followed it up right away with Ghoul and prior to that
with a movie called Love Per Square Foot. What it really was able to do was take this product that maybe was less known in India when we launched
and make it feel more local, more relevant. And what we saw was all of that was following a nice, steady increase in viewer engagement prior to
us launching those big original shows. So what they had was a product that people understood more, talked to their friends more about that was
written about more in the press and certainly talked about more by influencers and then delivered with content that isn't otherwise available in
the market, a series being produced at the quality -- the production quality of Sacred Games by way of example.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
And then to the question on pricing, what I would say is we're just getting started in India. And we feel like with the existing model that we have,
the prices that we're at, we've got a long runway still ahead of us. And we've seen that in sort of the increasing traction that we're getting in that
segment as we have the great content that Ted was mentioning. We increased our partnerships, we're improving the product experience. Now
we'll experiment with other pricing models, not only for India, but around the world, that allow us to sort of broaden access by providing a pricing
tier that sits below our current lowest tier. And we'll see how that does in terms of being able to accelerate our growth and get more access. But
even under the existing model, we feel like we have a long, long runway ahead of us in India.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
But maybe following up on something that Reed has talked about publicly in terms of the potential for growth in India longer term, how does the
model have to morph to maybe line up with longer-term goals of adding 100 million subscribers in a market like India?

OCTOBER 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q3 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
We'll have to see. We'll go from expanding beyond English into Hindi and then into many more languages, more pricing options, more bundling.
All of those things are possible. There's over 300 million mobile phone subscriptions -- or households, there's almost twice that in mobile phone
subscriptions. So there's a huge market and people in India, like around the world, love watching television. Now we'll take it a million at a time
and figure out how to expand the market as we grow.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
A couple of hundred million people watching content through the Internet in India is a really exciting idea.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
And just to wrap that, Eric, in terms of investor expectations, Reed's a million at a time, we're super encouraged with India and the growth that
we've got early on. But we know it's going to be somewhat of a tough market, right? So there's that notion is along -- is a million at a time, right?
It's not going to be overnight where we're going to get to those higher numbers.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Is there any way to tease out when you see subscriber growth internationally, like you just published for Q3, obviously, an even bigger number as
you forecast out to Q4, to tease out how much India's contributing to that versus non-India? And are there any markets on either the content side
or the subscriber side you'd like to call out ex India?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
For competitive reasons, we're not going to give you too much color on that. What's driving the P&L progress is doing shows that carry in multiple
territories, creating great synergy around those, great excitement. And that's why we really -- we hardly look at it U.S. and internationally, but we
look at it internally almost all just globally.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
And Eric, as you probably saw in the investor letter, we talked about the growth in our memberships being very broad-based and very global. So
I think you should read that as what we've said in the past, which is the phenomenon of Internet entertainment is really a global phenomenon that
we're benefiting from.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Fair enough. One of the things you're shifting a little bit further down the P&L into revenue, International saw some headwinds from FX this quarter.
Understand the translation issues around that. But wanted to understand if FX volatility is causing any headwinds or tailwinds you're seeing in
terms of end demand for the product or consumption of the product? Or is it purely a translation issue?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
It's mostly a translation issue. Absent foreign exchange or ASP, international ASP would have grown. So I don't think we see any demand effect
from foreign exchange.

OCTOBER 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q3 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Fair enough. Maybe 2 bigger picture questions. One, there came in a lot of formats from people ahead of the call. Competition. As you look out to
2019, I know not within the forecast period. But as you think about how the competitive landscape might shift, where the market is going from a
global standpoint, on the competitive standpoint, how do you think about some of the friction points you're trying to solve for as a company when
you look out at that competitive landscape?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
There are so many competitors. Of course, Disney is going to enter, AT&T is going to expand HBO, YouTube is just on fire growing around the world,
video gaming like Fortnite, I mean there's so many ways to have great entertainment on a screen. So we don't focus that much on any one because
no one seems to affect us that much. What affects us is can we produce the best content the world's ever seen? Can we get people excited about
that content? Can we serve it up in ways that make it really fun and easy? Again focusing on our fundamentals. And someday there will have to be
competition for wallet share, we're not naïve about that. But it seems very far off from everything we've seen. So -- and we're continuing to work
with many of those firms where it makes sense to for both of us, and it's creating a big and vibrant industry.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe one follow-up to that directed at Ted. When you think about the competitive landscape and what it might mean for either acquiring, sourcing
or partnering on content with people globally, Ted, how is that changing the conversations maybe as you look out over the medium to long term?
Where might we see some of the pressure points that competition could play out on the content side?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, we've been a pretty dependable buyer and, increasingly, some of those sellers have been more complicated sellers, meaning there are conflicts
within their companies of what they want to sell, when they want to sell it, what windows they would allow for to allow flexibility to offer their own
services, which is something we foresaw years ago when we started doing original programming. But in the meantime, I think that they are -- the
studios and -- who are always have been somewhat of potential competitors have to look at those things today and say, "What's the best way to
get return on investment for creating great content?" And so in some cases, it's going to be launching it through their own direct to consumer
initiatives. In other cases, it's going to be selling to Netflix, which has proved to be very positive for them for many years.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Can you talk a little bit about, maybe sticking with you, Ted, about some of the asks that are coming from content creators? We continue to hear
as we talk to people in the media industry about awards campaigns or marketing budgets put behind content, people want their content seen
who are content creators. How have some of those conversations changed? What might it mean for ways you go to market when you look out
over the next couple of years in terms of taking content into the marketplace?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, I think, what you said was perfect, that people definitely want their content seen, and the best chance of doing that is doing it with Netflix.
And you see in the long list of content brands and newly minted stars out of Netflix just this quarter, you can see what we're talking about, about
putting content into the culture and into the zeitgeist. And what's really great, it can get nominated and win Emmys or Oscars, and those are really
important to filmmakers and creators, and we're super proud and happy for them when they win. But in general, what we want to do is try to make
great content, elevate it to the right audience in the most efficient way possible so we could do more of it. And what we've seen more is that these
shows that come out on Netflix are really piercing the culture. Some of the most-watched shows in television are on Netflix, and the creators know

that. So when they -- what the -- the asks that are coming into forms of marketing campaigns and awards campaigns, they're seeing that in very
big numbers from us anyway. We had 40 shows nominated for Emmy's this year and became tied with HBO for the most Emmy wins this year. And
that comes with great content and great campaigns, both marketing and awards campaigns.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe 2 follow-ups here. The first one on the product side, the team has talked before about lowering the friction to consumers finding product.
That seems like a bit of a machine learning /product development issue that you have to solve for friction points as you look out over the next
couple of years. How should investors think about lowering friction to consumers finding content? What are some of those key investments that
are being made? How those investments might change in the next couple of years?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Again, I would draw your attention to the letter of the -- the list gave some very specific examples of people who went from being completely
unknown to being global superstars in the span of a few weeks or a few months of this quarter alone. So I think that it's evident that things are
being found in -- at an incredible pace on Netflix versus getting lost in the sea of things on Netflix.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
And our job is to make that even more over the years to come. And so we're investing in a variety of different dimensions, the one you mentioned,
but in terms of the design, the UX that we have, the user experience, just this quarter, we released an upgrade to our TV UI navigation that allows
users to be a little bit more specific in terms of the content that they are looking to browse through. So imagine it's Friday night, you want an
engaging movie. You can tell us that, and then we'll present the recommendations, the suggestions that we have of some of our growing impressive
film titles that you can really immerse yourself into. And that's just one of a line of multiple product updates that we anticipate having that we
think will magnify that effect that Ted is talking about, about incredible content being discovered in the show and then becoming a big social
phenomena.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Bigger theme that maybe I wanted to talk about was alternative content. There was a partnership announced with SiriusXM. How you're thinking
about new forms of content to be distributed on Netflix as you look out over the next couple of years? What are some of those things you think
your consumer is asking for that reduces churn, gives you more pricing power, gives you a higher ROI against some of the investments you're
making? We'd love to sort of tee that up broadly for the group.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well the -- in the case of the SiriusXM, that is a -- looking for kind of a marketing synergy for a stand-up comedy initiative being able to have bites
of our stand-up comedy specials that are otherwise only available on Netflix in their entire run as a way to entertain fans of stand-up comedy and
discover new talent, and that's just something, an ongoing part of our overall initiative. It's a pretty -- it's a small test right now to see how that
goes, putting up clips and interviews and interview shows featuring our talent and supporting our talent. So think about it as a different way of
marketing the existing program that we're doing when you're not on Netflix, when you're more likely on your car -- well, you shouldn't be on Netflix
in your car.

OCTOBER 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q3 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So Eric, per Ted's comment, we're not really focused on the monetization of those efforts. It's really around deepening the brand connection, which
ultimately monetizes as faster growth for us. So all of our auxiliary efforts are not around creating additional profit streams for now. They're really
aimed around strengthening these mega titles because that's what drives the business. And a little bit incremental growth is much more profitable
for us than creating separate businesses. So we're always evaluating them on, do they help the core? Do they help that love of the new stand-ups?
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe continuing to move through some of the cost in the business model. Marketing has been a heavily debated topic with investors as we've
gone through the last year. Saw a pretty big change from the over 90% growth in marketing you saw in Q2 to something much lower in Q3. I think
prior managements called out the idea that marketing would be sort of in a test and learn mode this year, maybe pivoting away from just pure
subscriber acquisition. So a couple of questions. Number one, what have you learned in some of the changes you made in marketing this year?
And how do you think that might inform how you go to market as a company going forward, both for subscriber growth and then support on the
content side?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Ted, do you want to take that?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes. I would say that, one thing that we've learned as we've gone along, there was a time when we didn't market any of our content. We spent all
of our marketing effort just talking about Netflix and how to use it. And today we find is that selling House of Cards in its final season is really all
about selling Netflix. So what we're learning more and more is that, yes, we can drive some viewing up and down, yes, we could draw -- but it's all
mostly centered around getting people excited about watching a show that's only on Netflix because it's a great thing for Netflix and how to sell
the service. So that gives us -- and we do it over many titles because people's tastes are very different. And being able to aggregate people to talk
about the same things and watch the same things at roughly the same time has got a lot of value. We're still learning all the fine arts of that.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
And Eric, just sort of on the financial aspect of the marketing spend, some of that, as we called out in the letter, was sort of timing related and
shifted a bit into Q4 so that sort of dynamic that you highlighted isn't a signal on any sort of specific change in the strategy.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
And that would lead to maybe my next question, so Spencer teed that one up for me. Thinking about the pace and cadence of investments in Q3
versus Q4, I thought there were some key learnings in the letter, but just want to give a little bit of an opportunity to frame what might have shifted
out of Q3 and into Q4, how investors should think about that against some of the longer-term investments you're trying to make in the business.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
It's either for Ted or I. I'll take the sort of marginal progression or the quarterly progression. I think we're balancing the steady growth of operating
margin but allowing the business to have the flexibility to choose sort of optimal release timing and promotional timing and create that flexibility
for them. So yes, next year we see a little bit more steadier progression towards the 13% target that we have for the year. But I think we'll see some
natural seasonality in terms of release -- content releases. And maybe that's a pitch to Ted now to take the next part.

OCTOBER 16, 2018 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q3 2018 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes. We've really been trying to optimize on when is the best time for the content creators and for the fans to release that content. And sometimes
they're regulated by outside forces, and other times they're just trying to line up that perfect viewing time. And they're trying to lead with that. We
end up with very happy members and very happy creators.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Following up on that, the comment from the letter about less quarterly variance, is that then just purely a function mostly of smoothed out marketing
spend and the fact that you have such a scale of content that had smoothed out more evenly over the year? Or is there anything you're doing
actively to sort of create less seasonality or less volatility in the cost structure of the company as you look out into '19 versus '18?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
It's mostly the latter, Eric. So we're not actively doing anything to the cost structure. We're just planning a little bit more in terms of the content
and the associated promotion that goes with that. But it's a bit of a balance. We don't want to go too far with this either because we, again, want
to create that flexibility for the business, right? We're not optimizing for margin progression by quarter. We're optimizing for a rolling 12-month
growth of operating margin, but we're just indicating this year is a little bit unusual. We don't see as much pronounced lumpiness next year as we
do this year.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
And maybe just one more on this, probably for you, David. The 13% plus or minus keeps up with sort of the pace you guys have talked about over
the last couple of years of around 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion on a rolling-forward basis. What are some of the things that could
cause that number to arc upward or downward that you think people should keep in the front of their mind as the business continues to make the
investments you want?
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
The biggest one is foreign exchange in terms of, yes, on a midterm to longer-term basis, we use pricing to offset negative foreign exchange or
dollar appreciation. But in the short term, we don't immediately do that. And so we can go through a couple of quarters where you're seeing foreign
exchange affect both, just like this quarter where we had it affect international ASP. But on a mid- to long-term basis, that should even out as we
use pricing. So foreign exchange is the big one. And then growth, if we have more growth than we expected, that's going to drive more revenue
and we'll get more of that in the back half of the year. But that could affect us as well. But those are the 2 big ones.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
If you think of our content cost as pretty baked, there's a little bit of flexibility quarter-to-quarter but not much. The marketing kind of has flexibility,
but you really want to launch the title so it follows the content schedule. And you can't shift it around trivially. So then as David said, they're mostly
top line factors between FX and revenue growth. The cost structure is pretty stable for next year.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
So following up on that, Reed, and maybe for anyone who wanted to take it. You talked a little bit about free cash flow in the letter, the lower end
of the range, a loss of about $3 billion this year and then possibly replicating that, a loss of around $3 billion, next year. One of the questions that
came into me in a variety of different forms was trying to size out either max free cash flow burn and what are some of the variables in the model

that people should be focused on and max leverage that you'd be willing to take up in the business as you think about over the medium to long-term
as well.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Eric, you're using the word loss and I think you mean the investment. We definitely hope that they're not turning into losses. Record would show
that those investments had turned out to be very successful for us. But I'll let David handle the question.
David B. Wells - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Reed took the immediate one that I was going to take, but so thanks on that. But yes, we're seeing those investments drive a lot of growth. So
there's a little bit of attention to that from us. Eric, the biggest thing is that we're approaching -- Netflix is approaching a point where the growth
in operating profit is going to grow faster than our growth in content cash spend. And that's really going to drive the free cash flow towards
improvement. It'll eventually break even. I think what we said in the letter is flat with this year. And mainly that's because 12 to 18 months ago, we
probably would've expected a little bit of a steeper peak and then a reduction. What's happened is content timing has kind of shifted back. We're
growing faster so we're investing some more of that into content. And so you get sort of a flattening of the trend forward. But we expect material
improvements in '20. We still think it's going to be a few years towards breakeven because we're optimizing again for long-term cash flow and
long-term profitability, and we think that's the right thing. And then in terms of peak leverage, I think what you're going to see is, at least electively,
funding our content, that leverage ratio is going to start to improve. But we're also looking at optimal weighted average cost of capital, which
we've already discussed and indicated that would be based on about a 20%, 25% leverage to market cap ratio is where we think the long-term
optimal cost of capital ought to be. And so once we push past the point where we're more secure and we're -- it's less about funding the immediate
working capital needs of the business, we'll turn over or shift to thinking about long-term optimal cost of capital.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
One of the key themes in the shareholder letter was you bucketed 3 different forms of content. Number one and number two were licensed, and
number three clearly was original, owned and operated, with a theme, I thought, of preference for bucket 3 to be the driver for the business over
the medium to long term. As you do think about some of your partners maybe pulling content off the platform in 2019, that's been talked a lot
about publicly, how do you think about either replacing that content from a volume standpoint or just redoubling your efforts around marketing
and increasing ROI around existing content and scaling against your own original content plans rather than thinking about those licensed buckets.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, I'd tell you, going back just a few years, that as we started, right, entering our original programming, what we've turned out is that our own
original shows tend to be more valuable than licensing someone else's shows in later windows in the kind of the shared window model versus the
purely original model. So when we invest in an original show, we find that we're having a better payback in terms of viewers, people watching and
appreciating Netflix and valuing their subscription. So that's why we're leaning in that way. We have a variety of models in which we've used to
get content so really what we want to do is focus on what is the best programming. So we get to be a little business model agnostic about if we
don't own the IP, then we want to figure out how to make that deal with the people who do. In some cases, they produce that for us in the first
window. In some case they produce that for their own networks, and we license it in the next second window. And that will continue. But what
we're pointing out in the letter is there's been a big -- we are driving a lot of programming through our own owned and produced originals that
we're producing in-house. Some of our biggest brands like Stranger Things are owned and produced in-house. And yet we're still licensing a lot
of original programming from our partners as well.
In terms of backfilling things that are coming off the site, one of the better examples, we think, of how it can work well for us has been in our
unscripted initiative which, last year, we had no unscripted original programming on Netflix. And this year, about half of our weighted watching
of unscripted programming are Netflix originals. And now therefore, the benefits of -- and about the same cash outlay but with much more efficiency,

meaning people are watching them in greater numbers for the same dollar spent. So -- and with that, we have much steadier access to programming.
And we're building brands that people associate with Netflix like Queer Eye and Fastest Car and Nailed It! and Sugar Rush. These are all shows that
people really love in enormous numbers around the world. And we don't have to go through the gun to your head renegotiation every couple of
years for them.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Ted, you had some good examples before per region like Bodyguard and Sherlock. So maybe you can...
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
That's right. We announced yesterday, a co-production with -- on Sherlock -- I'm sorry, not Sherlock, Dracula, from the makers of Sherlock with
Steve Moffat. I said we would love to make more and more content with Steve Moffat. His deal is with the BBC. And we get to be partners with
them to make this great show, Dracula, available around the world and in a fast follow model in the U.K. And we'll do a lot more of that. Bodyguard
is coming up in a few weeks and it's been a tremendous hit in the U.K. We came in very early in that financially and creatively, and we think they
made a much bigger and better show because of it. And we think we could be great partners with local public broadcasters and networks around
the world.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe following up on that because that's both a local as well as a global content sort of comment. How do you think about the ROI of local content
and what it can do when it goes global and acts as a stimulant for the platform in a much broader framework than maybe it was originally planned
for?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
What's super amazing about that today has been that these local language shows have been incredibly relevant in their home country, and then
they work very well in their region. And then when they really connect, they play multiregional and sometimes completely global. And we have
enough subscribers in the different territories today that we can have a real global hit in -- without much viewing in the U.S. or with a lot of viewing
in Latin America and the U.S. but none in Europe. So we're seeing a lot of those things that have benefit of scale obviously but also picking great
storytellers who tell stories that people want to hear around the world. And what we have found is that a good story well told works, and it works
in almost any language. So as long as we focus on the quality of production, those shows can be -- work to drive local subscribers in country but
also drive global viewing when we do it right.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe one more follow-up on the content side for you, Ted, the film side, obviously been a big push for the company. There's now been multiple
efforts that have gone out into the marketplace. What have you learned? What are some of the friction points you're still trying to solve for in terms
of both go to market and partnering with the right content creators on the film side? And how do you think about what that does for the platform,
again, medium to long term?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, we've been thrilled just recently we're releasing original films on Netflix from really A-list directors like Alfonso Cuarón and Susanne Bier, the
Coen brothers, Tamara Jenkins. And these are people who made movies for the -- directly to the theater their entire careers and are now moving
to producing more and more for Netflix. Because what they're finding is, to your point earlier, they want their content to be seen. They want their

film to be in the discussion. And they are able to do that on Netflix in ways they've never seen before. Paul Greengrass film 22 July just came out a
few days ago, and millions of people are enjoying it all over the world in ways that he's never experienced for his films yet. And that will roll into
'19 with big new films from Michael Bay and Martin Scorsese. And what we're finding is that people want their audience -- their films to find an
audience and that they're in a better position to do that with us than without us. And that's a, I think, really exciting position to be in for film lovers.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe pivoting back to the product side of the equation. You've talked a lot in the last couple of calls about getting mobile right not only short
term but as a stimulant for long-term growth. Reed referenced earlier, there's a lot of people that want to consume content, especially mobile first
as you think globally. What are some of those product developments we should be looking for that you are hearing back from consumers with
either increased engagement or increased adoption of the platform that aren't there yet when you think about where mobile viewing of media
content globally will go over the long term?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Yes. I think we see an opportunity to improve almost every aspect of that product experience, but I'll just throw out a couple of interesting ones.
One is as a method of acquisition. And again, it's very consistent with what we talked about in terms of extending the partnerships, the kind of
partnerships we have with mobile operators, whether that's a bundle model like we just did our first bundle in Japan with a mobile operator KDDI.
We've done a bunch of preloads with Verizon on their Android phones in the United States. So there's just all these different ways which we can
use that as a vehicle to bring more subscribers onto the service. But there's also a great sort of subscriber experience component of it too, which
is something that we're exploring more and more is not only just a direct content enjoyment part of the experience but things like previews and
teasers and what's coming now and how can we sort of create a continuum of experience which is not only that great directly engaged moment
when you're watching that show you've been dying to watch, but also things that sort of lead up to that, which maybe don't take a 30- or a 45-minute
viewing session, but you can get 5 minutes, you're waiting in line and you can catch a preview of a show that you are excited to watch and maybe
you watch that when you get home later tonight. And that's the kind of experience, I think, we really can invest in and see good returns from in
the years to come.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Eric, I think we have time for one last question, please.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Yes. Maybe I'd love to end on a bigger picture question for Reed. Reed, I think you've seen other technology platforms like some of the other
companies I cover diversify more as they become more mature and enter new areas. Netflix is staying fairly focused on streaming media and
pushing your message globally about adoption and creation of content. How do you think about staying focused on the business model you have
today versus looking for areas for diversification as you go globally that can be put on top of the business model, especially the brand awareness
and the technology platform you built as you look out globally over the long term?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Yes. Think about it, if you've got 5 to 10 years more growth in your current market, you're probably optimizing value to stay in your current market
and strengthen. Eventually, your market may not be able to hold your growth ambitions. So that happened to us in DVD, we couldn't stay in DVD
forever. Of course, we diversified into streaming. So we're open to those possibilities. But there is so much growth ahead that's possible in streaming
video entertainment. So we're just going to focus on that for a very long time. Unfortunately, lots of other companies are also focusing on that. But
that's going to make it exciting for us for the next few years. Great for consumers, incredible for producers. I mean there's never been so much TV
and movies being created around the world. And so the game is on. We're super excited about pleasing consumers as much as we possibly can.

And someday, many, many years from now, we may need to diversify. But for now, it's focus on the core, those amazing title brands. And when
you look at the content we have coming out this quarter and next year, we couldn't be more excited, we couldn't be more busy.
So with that, let me thank everyone for participating in the call. Thank you, Eric, for conducting it and look forward to talking with you all soon.

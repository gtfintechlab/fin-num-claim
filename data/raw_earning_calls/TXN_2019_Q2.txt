PRESENTATION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' 2Q '19 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this
time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is
with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can
be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from
management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the
earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level
summary of the financial results for the second quarter; and second, some details by segment and end market. Rafael will then review
profitability, capital management results and then the outlook. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A.
Starting with high-level summary of our second quarter financial results:
The quarter progressed about as we expected with revenue decreasing 9% from a year ago due to broad-based weakness. In our core
businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 16% compared with the same quarter a year ago.
Both businesses' year-on-year growth decelerated.
Earnings per share were $1.36 including a 7-cent benefit for items not in our original guidance. The benefit includes 4 cents due to the
previously announced sale of our Greenock, Scotland fab, with the balance primarily due to discrete tax benefits.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength
of our business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth,
especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning
all of our free cash flow to owners.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was

38.9% of revenue, up from 36.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and
diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing
12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to our owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating
our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the second quarter by segment and end market.
From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 6% due to declines in High Volume, Power and Signal Chain.
Embedded Processing revenue declined by 16% from the year-ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and
Connected Microcontrollers.
Next, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago.
Industrial and automotive together declined upper-single digits due to broad-based weakness.
Personal electronics declined low-double digits also due to broad-based weakness.
In communications equipment, revenue declined sequentially but was about even from a year ago versus a very weak compare.
And lastly, enterprise systems declined.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and
driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing
semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a
high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.36 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross
profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $810 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month
basis, operating expenses were 21.1% of revenue, within our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.57 billion in R&D,
an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined processes of allocating capital to R&D, which we
believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.
Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third
quarter of this year then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.
Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our Greenock, Scotland facility.
Operating profit was $1.51 billion or 41.1% of revenue. Operating profit was down 12% from a year-ago quarter. Operating margin for
Analog was 43.7%, down from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 33.5%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused
investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to
contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.

Other income and expense was $52 million benefit, up $28 million primarily due to investment gains and tax-related items.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.31 billion or $1.36 per share, which included a 7-cent benefit for items that were not in our prior
outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.
Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $284 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a
trailing 12-month basis was $5.93 billion.
In the second quarter, we paid $722 million in dividends and repurchased $863 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.59
billion. In total, we have returned $8.01 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over
the same period, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.22 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Total debt is
$5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%.
Inventory days were 143, up eight days from a year ago and down one day sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made
replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work
in both of these areas will continue in the third quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory, and
we'll manage it with our long-term objectives in mind.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and earnings per share to
be in the range of $1.31 to $1.53, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating
tax rate to be about 16% for 2019.
In closing, we have just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. As we stated last quarter, if you look at the last 30
years of history in our industry, cycles are always different, but typically you could see four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before
year-on-year growth resumes. Again, we're not trying to forecast the cycle but simply offer some historical perspective.
Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages,
which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to
strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded
Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash
flow per share growth for a long time to come. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director
For my first one, when you reported three months ago, I think things were looking somewhat more downbeat. And I was curious, Rafael
or Dave, how would you characterize the current environment. Is it similar? Is it better? Is it worse? I'm just trying to put your Q3 outlook,
which is 4% -- 3% to 4% sequential growth. It's below seasonal trend, but it's still up sequentially. So I'm just trying to get a better sense
of how you are seeing the broader environment versus three months ago.

Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, I'll start, and if Rafael wants to add anything, he's welcome to. I think as we stated, the quarter came in about as we expected and
that was really across the board. Really all the end markets performed about as we had expected. We just completed our third quarter of
year-on-year declines for TI. And I think that if you look at history, things are always different when you look at cyclicality, but I think
things are performing as we would expect.
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Yes, the only thing I would add is we're ready for any scenario. If the economy strengthens, we're ready. If it runs sideways or if it
weakens, we're ready. And that's both a strategic comment, how we position the company, focused on auto and industrial and catalog
products inside of that, but also operationally with our inventory strategy and other things that we're doing to continue to strengthen the
company.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Right. You have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director
So for my follow-on, I'm curious, the sales to China, how is the environment there? I assume that you don't have a lot of direct specific
exposure to Huawei. But what's the demand environment, I guess, in China and outside of China? But -- are conditions better outside of
China? And then within China, how is the demand environment outside of Huawei?
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, so I think we've said before that Huawei is about 3% to 4% of our revenue overall. It's a mix of comms equipment and some handset
in there and some other products. And if you look at comms equipment overall, it's 11% of our revenue. We had seen some nice growth in
our 5G products, as we've talked about before. And if you look from a regional standpoint, I'd say there's nothing unusual going on.
We've talked about that in the past when there was. And certainly, if you look at where we ship product, that's not always indicative of
actual end demand or end look-through to those economies, meaning we may ship into one region and that may get packaged up and
shipped to another region before it's actually consumed. So overall, by the regions, they came in as we expected and nothing unusual.
We didn't see anything unusual this quarter. So thank you, Vivek.
Operator
We'll hear now from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD
Guys, based on the comments that you just made, it appears as though your view on the cycle hasn't really changed over the past couple
months. That said, I think you guys decided to delay the new fab. So just curious what kind of thought process went into the decision to
push the fab.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, so just to clarify, we said back in our February capital management call, and really have been saying since then, that we plan to
begin building that next factory in the next few years. And that hasn't changed. There was a filing and it was a proposed amendment to a
local tax abatement schedule that has caused some confusion on that topic. But just to say again, as we said back in February, those
plans hadn't changed. You have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD
I do. And then just going back to the U.S.-China situation, I realize your business tends to be very sticky, but has the backdrop impacted
your ability to conduct business in China at all? Or have you sensed any shifts to market share in your business?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
No, not -- this is Rafael. No, not at all.

Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, and I'd just say that our markets, because they're diverse and you see market share doesn't move around quickly, they're just good
quality markets. And one of our competitive advantages, being diversity and longevity, I think helps us in markets like this and situations
like that in particular. Okay. Thank you, Toshiya.

We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst
I had a question on gross margin flow-through -- fall-through and especially as it relates to utilization and inventory. So free cash flow 12
months trailing, which you always point us to correctly, which is kind of in the same ballpark that you had last quarter, but then inventory
was down and the fall-through to margins is much higher incrementally. And I know it's not the same every quarter, but I was just curious
if there's something going on there. What are the puts and takes that caused the incremental fall-through to be higher?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Yes, I'll take that. From a -- the way you want to think about it is our fall-through, as we have said before, is about 70% to 75%, and you
want to look at that on a year-on-year basis. And even then, this is sometimes a little less, a little more. But that's the right way to look at
it, and this quarter is actually right between that 70% and 75%.
The other thing I would mention is over a longer time period, over the last many years and we expect this to continue, you're seeing the
benefit of 300-millimeter manufacturing. That is part of our competitive advantage, manufacturing technology. And as we have talked
about before, it's just a structural cost advantage because of the geometry of the wafer and the relatively small incremental cost that
goes into producing a 300-millimeter wafer versus a 200-millimeter wafer. So we expect that benefit to continue to accrue to gross
margins and ultimately free cash flow margin, which is the one that drives value for the owners of the company.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst
Yes, I did, and this is more blocking and tackling and I know you guys have correctly refrained from calling a cycle because everybody's
track record, including my own, is absolutely wrong on that front. But bookings, cancellations and lead times, where are we on these
metrics?
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, I think if you look at those metrics overall, I'd say that inventory in the channel, and more broadly, I think you're looking at kind of
cyclical metrics that you look at, inventory in the channel was down about a day. Still at about 4.5 weeks and has been steady at that for
a couple of quarters now. Order rates, when we look at those, those looked normal as they came through. Cancellations were down a
little bit from last quarter but really didn't change much. And then our lead times overall have remained stable. Certainly, they were
stable as things got more heated in the industry. But -- and of course, there's always areas that we would still be tight on today, but in
general, the lead times have remained very stable. So thank you, Ambrish.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
First, just on Huawei. You answered sort of generally. But specifically, what do you have embedded in your guidance regarding Huawei?
Are you still contemplating selling product to them, or are you not? What's in the guidance regarding that customer?

Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, so I'd say, Stacy, just over this past quarter, we obviously had halted shipments when the order was given. Since then we've resumed
shipments of the products that we've determined we could ship, that are in compliance with the U.S. regulations. So overall in this
quarter, things came in as we expected. As I stated before, that would be inclusive of communications equipment, where Huawei would
sit. So in our guidance, we obviously have that in for the quarter. And if there was something unusual that we are keeping out, our
practice has been to call that out, and there's nothing unusual that we're planning on. You have a follow-on?
Stacy Aaron Rasgon Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
Yes, I do. Well, the stockpiling and consignment one-off strategy that you've been doing, it's been going on for a while. How much do you
think that has increased utilization over the last few quarters as you've been rolling that out? And how much longer do you anticipate
driving that strategy before it reaches completion?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Let me start and then, Dave, if you want to comment. But we've had an inventory strategy for many years. We've just continued to tweak
it over time, make it better, stronger. And as the cycle started in third quarter or so, then we deployed some specific tools during that
time to then take advantage of that situation and use -- while we cut our wafer starts, we devoted an increasing share of that to the low
volume inventory strategy. We have built a lot of that but it's not complete. But incrementally, it's going to be less going forward than
what it was in the last few quarters because you get to obviously diminishing returns at some point on that.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes. And I'll point out that obviously, you saw our inventory dollars were down sequentially. They're actually down year-on-year. Our
inventory days were down sequentially even with those planned builds of those low volume parts, and we feel really good about being
able to do that in our operations.
The second part of your question there was what is the impact of -- consignment have on utilization. It really has no impact at all.
Basically, it optically, and by definition, just puts more inventory on our books. But even if the inventory didn't change in the channel, it
just would put pressure and optically put pressure on our inventory, and that's going on as well.
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Yes, I want to make one more comment on this topic. Remember what inventory is about, right? What is the objective of inventory? It's
not about maximizing utilization or gross margins or anything like that. It's about maintaining high levels of customer service. So what
we have done is deployed our cash to inventory. And as Dave said, inventory actually decreased. So -- but within that decrease, we built
some inventory of low volume parts. That now puts us in a great position as we move into the third quarter and beyond to have that
inventory of low volume that is generally difficult to build, we have it ready. So then we'll be able to serve our customers on the other side
of this very well.
Operator
We'll hear now from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Clark Seymore Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD
I want to stick on that consignment topic but just a slightly different spin. I think you've said in the last calls -- last few calls that it's
upwards of 2/3 of your revenues go through consignment. That's increased substantially over the last three, five, 10 years. Why do you
think your year-over-year revenue performance is so similar to your broader peer group if you're controlling that inventory? I would think,
all else being equal, you wouldn't have to deal with the distribution channel burning inventory and weighing on your revenues during a
period like this.
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
I'll give you one comment, and Dave, if you want to chime in. What I would tell you is maybe take into account, in the last, what, four
quarters or so, five quarters, we have gone through the next phase of consignment. And we have added, I want to say, $30 million to $40
million of revenue to that program per quarter during that time, for a total of close to $200 million. We probably still have one more

quarter to go where that is -- where that's going to happen and maybe through the end of the year, but it's getting to diminishing point.
But that is revenue that from the P&L it had sort of disappeared, right? But obviously, the demand hasn't changed. The end demand truly
hasn't changed. It's just that now it goes into our inventory and the revenue is delayed. But it just puts us in a much better position to
then own that inventory, distribute it better where it's needed, work with our manufacturing facilities better to determine what's needed
to be built for -- to replace -- replenish that inventory. So it's just a better way to operate.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, and I'll just add that when you think of one of our competitive advantages, which is the reach of our market channels, this is just one
component of what we're doing to have a closer, more direct relationship with our customers. And we think that ultimately, servicing
them better with product will benefit them and therefore benefit us. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Clark Seymore Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD
Yes, one -- it's a little bit more housekeeping, Dave. From an end market point of view, you went through and gave the year-over-years.
So could you give the quarter-over-quarters beyond the comms side? And was there any reason you put industrial and automotive
together, saying they were down upper-single digits year-over-year? Usually, you split those.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
No. Yes. Sure. So the first is they performed similarly. Industrial was a little weaker. Auto was a little less weak but in the same zip code.
And that was the same for the sequential. Together, they grew low-single digits, and that same profile was the same. Personal
electronics grew high-single digits with broad-based seasonal growth. Comms equipment, as I mentioned earlier, had declined, and then
enterprise systems actually grew sequentially. Okay. Thank you, Ross.
Operator
We'll hear now from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Looking at the most recent SIA data, April, May sales were down about 10% year-over-year for the global analog segment, while you
guys were only down 6%. You clearly outperformed the analog segment last year as well. So outside of the end market mix, i.e., better
comm equipment sector, can you guys just help us understand any product areas where you're either capturing market share or seeing
strong dollar content growth?
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Well, yes. So first, Harlan, I'd always be careful to read too much into any of those numbers in the short term. I think when you look at
share gains, they just really need to be measured even over several year period. And I think that's -- even in that case, I think we come out
very well. I think especially, we continue to do well in industrial and automotive. As I mentioned earlier, that is -- we believe that those
will be the most important markets to semiconductors and industrial in particular. And we've got a lot of programs and a lot of thought
going into how to get better and get stronger to be able to service those markets. Do you have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I know we have to be careful on how we interpret this number, but can you guys just tell us what the book-to-bill ratio was for the June
quarter?
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes. So you set me up perfect there because I always have the preamble that I'll give it. I debated, honestly, whether I should continue to
give it, but I will just because we do, but there is a lot of noise that's in it. So it was 0.94 and it was 1.06 a year ago and 0.99 last quarter.
So -- and I'll just remind everyone that we have the majority of the revenue on consignment. So we don't get orders in advance for that.
We've got backlog in the consignment. The orders in the backlog were all consistent with the guidance that we gave. So thank you,
Harlan.

We'll hear now from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher Brett Danely Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD
Can you just talk about the linearity of orders during the quarter? And I guess more specifically, have you seen any change in customer or
channel behavior since the Huawei reinstatement and, I guess, the threat of $300 billion in additional tariffs was taken away a few weeks
ago?
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes, Chris, really no changes on that front. I think when we look at the linearity, it came in fairly normal minus the stock shipment to
Huawei. But once we determined that we could continue to resume most of those products, it really got back to normal pretty quickly. Do
you have a follow-on?
Christopher Brett Danely Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD
Yes. Given we're in this, I guess, mildly depressed or sluggish or flaccid or whatever you want to call it kind of environment, have you guys
changed your thoughts on kind of long-term CapEx?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
The short answer is no. We are -- as we said in our capital management strategy, our guide on CapEx is 6% and will continue to be 6%.
And that's without building. So of course, as we've talked about, we announced the new factory that will -- the new 300-millimeter
factory that we'll build in Richardson, Texas in the next few years. Outside of that, we'll be running about 6%.

We'll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark John Lipacis Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst
Can you hear me okay?
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
We can, Mark.
Mark John Lipacis Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. The -- your inventories declined in dollars and days. What do you think happens to your inventories on your balance sheet in the
September quarter? And Dave, on the inventory commentary, I believe you said you characterize channel inventory as kind of in a stable
range. Would you call them stable in a normal and healthy level? Or would you characterize them somewhat differently?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Let me start, and Dave, if you want to jump in. But let me first step back to the objective for inventory to remind everybody and as I said
earlier in the call, is to maintain high levels of customer service. We also want to minimize obsolescence of that inventory and improve
asset utilization, but the main thing is to maintain high levels of customer service and our target is 115 to 145. So last quarter -- two
quarters ago, we went above that target, 152. But then last quarter, we're at 144 in one -- first quarter, and then second quarter we just
finished at 143. So both of those inside of our target.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP
Yes. And I'll just add again that even inside of those numbers, we've made really good progress of executing to building those low volume
parts, and we believe that's important so we can continue to service customers well. And the second part of your question, Mark, was,
yes, it was down a little bit sequentially on a days basis in distribution, still at about 4.5 weeks. That is a healthy level. And I would say
that, that number will structurally kind of work its way down as we're implementing more of this revenue on consignment, and that's a
great thing for our distributors. It's a great thing for our customers, and it does require that we'll be carrying some more inventory on our
balance sheet. But we think that that's a good investment in working capital. Do you have a follow-on, Mark?

Mark John Lipacis Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst
Yes, please. The follow-up is have you been noticing since the U.S. and China trade debate, have you been noticing any shift in the supply
chain from a standpoint of where things are being manufactured, not your own Texas Instruments supply chain but where you're
shipping to? Are you shipping more outside of China? Or is everything fairly stable?
Rafael R. Lizardi Texas Instruments Incorporated - Senior VP of Finance & Operations, CFO and CAO
Yes, I'll take that. It's too early to tell. We read some of the same media reports and anecdotal comments that people make on that front,
but it's too early to tell. So we'll watch how things evolve on that front over the next few years.
So I want to finish with a few comments on key items for everybody to remember. We will remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the
best products, and industrial and automotive, the best markets. We will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management
strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. And finally, we continue to believe growing
free cash flow per share dollars over the long term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company.
Dave Pahl Texas Instruments Incorporated - Head of IR & VP

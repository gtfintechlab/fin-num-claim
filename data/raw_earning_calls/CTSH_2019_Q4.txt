MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Fourth Quarter 2019 
Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the

Global Head-Investor Relations, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release 
for the company's fourth quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. 
The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief 
Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the 
responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks 
and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide 
useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the 
corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody. As I've said it on prior calls, Cognizant is in the midst of a multiyear project, whose aim is to reposition the company to realize its full growth potential. And today, I'd like to briefly 
cover our Q4 performance, and then, turn our attention to 2020.
After a challenging start to 2019, we're seeing higher levels of engagement from our leaders and optimism as we 
rally behind client centricity and revenue growth. We're making progress but there's more work to do in the 
quarters ahead. Q4 revenue grew 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.28 billion, non-GAAP EPS was 
$1.07, and we delivered strong cash flow.
Macro demand remains stable but challenging. There is a distinction between traditional work versus digital. 
Legacy services are subject to meaningful pricing pressure at renewals, competition, and indeed, in-sourcing. 
Meanwhile, clients continue to invest in digital to become modern, data-enabled, customer-centric, and 
differentiated businesses. These trends are set to continue, so our strategic posture and operational and financial 
initiatives are aligned to address this market reality.
On a geographic basis, Q4 revenue in North America grew 3.1% year-over-year, while revenue in our growth 
markets region grew 7.4% in constant currency. In both geographies, we are determined to accelerate growth.

But the opportunity is especially significant in our international business, where we remain underpenetrated, and 
we must do better.
From an industry segment view, in Q4, our Financial Services global revenue grew 1.5% year-over-year in 
constant currency. Both banking and insurance were weak throughout 2019. Full-year insurance revenue growth 
slowed primarily due to a modest decline in North America, albeit with a return in the second half of the year, 
where we saw growth in Q3, and indeed, Q4 year-over-year.
In banking, we continue to see particular weakness in capital markets and commercial banking, offset by growth 
in payments and retail, with retail having benefited from the Samlink deal. Both global accounts and local 
accounts declined for the full year. North America performance, while still declining, has been improving 
throughout the year, and we see that trend continuing. Europe remains weak, with some macro uncertainty and 
some Cognizant-specific issues.
In Healthcare, we reversed two quarters of declines, with constant currency growth of 1.8% year-over-year. I 
remain pleased with our performance in life sciences, which delivered double-digit growth. However, this was 
offset by ongoing declines in our Healthcare vertical, which continues to be impacted by contract renegotiations at 
some of our largest clients, following industry consolidation and by in-sourcing at a large client.
Our other two segments, Products and Resources, and Communications, Media and Technology, posted highsingle digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year, down from double-digits in prior quarters. 
Revenue growth in the Technology segment slowed meaningfully in the quarter, following our recent 
announcement to exit a subset of the content services business over the coming quarters. Later in our call, Karen 
will take you through the details of the quarter.
Let's now turn to 2020, including executing the recommendations of the transformation office, as they relate to 
strategy, operating and commercial models, our cost base, and more. We entered 2020 with a two-pronged 
strategy that aims to expose Cognizant to faster-growing market categories. The first element is to protect and 
optimize our core business while scaling internationally. The second part is to invest to compete and win in four 
key digital battlegrounds: data, digital engineering, cloud, and IoT.
Our strategy leverages our technology services heritage, whilst accelerating our position in digital, where our 
brand recognition and commercial momentum can improve. The strategy resonates well with our clients who have 
always cited our strength in the run and operation side but want us to further strengthen our digital portfolio to 
assist them in their innovation agenda. We're determined to help our clients become fully digital, data-enabled, 
customer-centric businesses.
We will continue to use M&A to execute this strategy. This week, we announced two acquisitions focused on 
extending our cloud capabilities. On Monday, we announced the acquisition of Code Zero Consulting, a firm that 
specializes in helping companies digitally transform by providing strategy, implementation, and migration 
capabilities to evolve legacy systems to cloud-based Configure-Price-Quote and billing systems. And earlier 
today, we announced that we've entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire the French operations of EITechnologies, a Paris-based privately-held digital technology consulting firm.
Cloud has changed the way that IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms, and both of these 
acquisitions are Salesforce Platinum partners and will help us build upon one of our most strategic and fastestgrowing practices. In addition, in Q4, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Contino, a leading 
consultancy that specializes in enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms.

The transformation office also recommended changes to our operating and commercial models. After months of 
detailed analysis, on January 1 we implemented a series of measures to accelerate our commercial momentum 
as part of our sales transformation initiative. And these include a new customer segmentation that prioritizes 
accounts and ensures we get the right resources on the right accounts at the right time; new sales compensation 
plans that reward overperformance, encourage greater upsell and cross-sell in our existing accounts, and 
increase our focus on new logos; and the alignment of our specialist sales team to our service lines to increase 
our subject matter expertise by key practices.
To-date, I'm pleased with what we've seen in our sales force initiative. We have renewed energy and our win 
rates continue to improve. Our previously announced hiring of 500 revenue-generating associates is on track and 
in line with modeled assumptions. In addition to these 500, we plan to double the number of associates 
supporting our most strategic alliances with all three leading hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors.
Complementing these commercial changes, our recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer has been working 
diligently to better align our marketing spend to our growth priorities. This includes strengthening our point of view 
by industry segment, improving targeting via account-based marketing, and digitizing our customer engagement 
strategies. Our marketing spend will increase in 2020 as we aim to support our revenue aspirations and better 
position Cognizant as a leader in digital.
In parallel, we've also worked to simplify the organization, empowering our client partners for speed of execution 
and account P&L ownership, and clarifying responsibilities and decision rights for all roles across the sales 
lifecycle. To ensure we have the right digital skills in a supply-constrained environment, we've doubled our 
investments in Cognizant Academy in 2020 to re-skill and redeploy talent towards our digital imperatives. To 
accelerate our digital momentum, we believe we need to hire or re-skill approximately 25,000 resources in 2020 
alone, and we started to operationalize this.
Finally, as we make these investments in automation, training, marketing, and sales, we've been diligently 
reducing our cost structure to ensure we can be fit for growth. Karen will bring you through the details of our 
restructuring program later in the call.
Engagement and confidence are essential in a people business. Therefore, we've been energetically 
communicating and contextualizing the reasons for the changes we're going through and engaging the 
organization to rally everyone behind our goals. I'm pleased to see the mood in the company continue to pick up, 
both at an executive level and throughout the broader organization.
Our annualized attrition rate fell 3 points sequentially to 21%. Some of this can be accounted for by normal 
seasonality. So the fact that voluntary attrition rates declined year-over-year is actually even more encouraging. 
Of course, as we execute our restructuring program, we will remain diligent and stay focused on increasing 
employee engagement and reducing attrition.
We also recognize that we need to rally the organization behind a common purpose that goes beyond financial 
returns. We've therefore spent a great deal of time in recent months defining a compelling company purpose 
statement, which will serve as our North Star that guides and inspires us to make the right strategic moves in the 
years ahead. We've also refined our company's values and behaviors that define what will be celebrated and 
tolerated. We will unveil this to the broader organization in the coming months.

We're determined to stay true to the heart and soul of our company, and having recently attended our annual 
global planning summits, one held in Dallas, the other in Dubai, where the executive team and I spoke to 
thousands of associates about the company's strategy and expectations for 2020, I can tell you that I came away 
from these summits filled with optimism about our collective ability to move the company forward.
Let me conclude by saying that after a challenging first quarter, we've become a more focused, determined, and 
confident company as we move through 2019. There's a great deal of urgency in Cognizant these days. It starts 
with me. Any distractions we've had are now behind us. Our team is energized by the clarity of our strategy, the 
magnitude of the market opportunity, our renewed client centricity, and our increased employee value proposition 
focus.
While our hard work in the past year will serve us well in 2020, there remains some important areas that require 
progress in the years ahead. Pricing in our heritage business continues to pressure gross margins, so we have 
efforts underway to address renewal pricing strategy, as well as our cost of delivery efficiency, including pyramid 
management, automation, and other measures.
Meanwhile, as more work shifts to project-based digital engagements, we are implementing refinements in our 
digital pricing strategy, and continuing to optimize resource planning and allocation. The leadership team and I 
are fully aware that we have a multi-year project ahead of us, and we are united in a result to work with rigor and 
tenacity to achieve our goals and once again make Cognizant the industry bellwether.
Before I turn the call over to Karen, I want to acknowledge that Cognizant Co-Founder, former CEO, and longtime 
Director, Frank D'Souza, has let us know of his plan to resign from Cognizant board of directors effective March 
31. Along with his remarkable track record of success as Cognizant's CEO for a dozen years, Frank has served 
with distinction on Cognizant's board since 2007 and Vice Chairman since June 30, 2019. On behalf of the entire 
board, I want to extend our deep gratitude to Frank for his pioneering leadership and quarter century of dedication 
to Cognizant. Today, we also announced that Vinita Bali will be joining our board of directors later this month. I 
look forward to her contributions and partnership.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Karen who will give you an update on our operational and financial 
performance, as well as a view of how we see the year ahead. Karen?

Karen Anne McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. For the full-year 2019, revenue increased to $16.8 billion and 
represented growth of 4.1% year-over-year or 5.2% in constant currency. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.3 billion 
was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.8% year-over-year or 4.2% in constant 
currency. The revenue outperformance versus guidance was broad-based across our industries. Digital revenue 
continued to grow above 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 38% of total revenue for the quarter.
Moving to the industry verticals, Financial Services growth was up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency, 
driven primarily by insurance. However, the project-based work that we benefited from in Q3 did not extend into 
Q4. We saw a modest slowdown in banking sequentially, reflecting typical year-end seasonality and furloughs. As 
Brian mentioned, within banking, our performance continues to be negatively impacted by a few of our global 
accounts, as well as some slowness in certain regional and other clients. While macro uncertainty persists, we 
expect budgets within banking to be broadly stable in 2020, with North America banks better positioned relative to 
UK and Continental Europe, given continued Brexit uncertainty and our ongoing challenges with a few of our 
largest accounts.

Against that backdrop, we continue to have a muted outlook for banking. However, we are confident in the initial 
steps our new Head of Banking has taken to reposition us for growth. We expect this client centricity to drive 
deeper and more robust account planning and marketing. By partnering well with digital business to ensure we 
increase our relevance to banks, he has also implemented a solutions team to bring ease of repeatability, ensure 
we develop more compelling thought leadership, and better align with key partners.
Moving on to Healthcare, which returned to year-over-year growth, up 1.8% in constant currency. Life sciences, 
again, grew strong double digits year-over-year, benefiting from demand within digital operations and the 
contribution of advanced technologies. Additionally, we see continued momentum within our industry-specific 
platform solutions, such as the Shared Investigator portal for clinical trials, which has users in over 80 countries 
across 14,000 facilities, covering over 400 active trials.
Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined mid-single digits year-over-year, as performance continued to be 
impacted primarily by large clients involved in mergers and the continued shift of work to a captive at a large 
client. We expect similar year-over-year trends in Healthcare in Q1 and improvement in the year-over-year trends 
in the Healthcare vertical beginning in Q2, as we lap the headwinds that impacted the business in 2019. We 
expect continued cautious spend with healthcare payers as we approach the elections in the US later this year. 
And so, we're maintaining a cautious growth outlook for the Healthcare vertical.
Products and Resources grew 8.6% year-over-year in constant currency. As we mentioned on our last earnings 
call, we expected slower growth on a year-over-year basis in Products and Resources in the fourth quarter, as we 
lapped the ramp-up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018. We were 
pleased that the growth in the quarter continued to be broad-based growth across our industries. Results reflect 
demand for core modernization services of enterprise applications, and for digital engineering, cloud, and IoT 
solutions, and we expect these trends to continue in 2020.
Our Communications, Media, and Technology segment grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, where we 
saw an acceleration in the Communications and Media vertical, driven by an increase in demand for services in 
core modernization and cloud transformation services. We expect continued solid performance with telecom 
clients, as traditional telco companies look to transform into digital service providers. Additionally, we see 
convergence across media and communications companies, driving investment in technologies and services that 
hyper-personalize consumption, and create new and engaging experiences for consumers.
In Technology, growth was negatively impacted by our decision to exit certain portions of our content services 
business. This negatively impacted the year-over-year growth of the CMT segment by approximately 200 basis 
points or $11 million. I'll provide more color on the expected impact from our decision to exit certain parts of the 
content services business with my Q1 and full-year 2020 guidance.
Now, turning to geos. We were disappointed with growth in Europe, which grew 5.3% year-over-year in constant 
currency, reflecting a slowdown in both the UK and Continental Europe. A more cautious macro environment 
continues to weigh on spend across industries in the UK, while we also have some Cognizant-specific challenges 
in a few large banking clients. The rest of world grew 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, the strongest 
performance in seven quarters. While our global banking relationships continue to pressure growth in AsiaPacific, we have seen improved traction in countries such as Australia and Japan in insurance and life sciences.

Moving on to margins, in Q4, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.6% and $0.72, respectively. 
Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring charges, was 17%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was 
$1.07.
Before getting into more details on margins, I want to provide an update on the enactment of a new tax regime in 
India that enables domestic companies to elect to be taxed at an income tax rate of 25% compared to the current 
rate of 35%. A company electing into the lower rate is required to forego any tax holidays associated with the 
special economic zones and certain other tax incentives, including MAT credit carry-forwards.
Our current intent is to elect into the lower rate once our existing net assets are substantially utilized. As a result, 
we recorded a onetime net income tax expense of $21 million due to the revaluation to the lower income tax rate 
of our existing India net deferred income tax assets. This had a negative $0.04 impact on GAAP EPS in the 
quarter.
Our adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year, reflecting SG&A discipline, offset by continued pressure 
on gross margin, including a $25 million write-off of certain capitalized setup costs for a large healthcare 
customer. The write-off negatively impacted gross margin by 50 basis points and EPS by $0.04.
Over the last several quarters, we have taken steps to start to right-size our cost structure, primarily focused on 
reducing overhead in the business, with those benefits evident in the year-over-year improvement in SG&A. 
These savings are necessary to fund the planned additional investments in areas such as sales resources, 
branding, talent, and lean and automation enhancements across the company.
However, gross margin declined year-over-year, as we continue to face pricing pressure in the legacy parts of our 
business that require us to take additional actions in 2020 around pyramid optimization and pricing levers such as 
COLA and aligning bill rates with promotions. We expect our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan that we announced last 
quarter to drive improvements in these areas. I'll provide an update on the actions taken in Q4 under the 2020 Fit 
for Growth Plan, as well as additional details on the expected execution of this plan later in the call.
Turning to our balance sheet, our cash and short-term investment balance as of December 31 stood at $3.4 
billion, up approximately $350 million through September 30, but down $1.1 billion from the year-ago period, 
reflecting the over $2.2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2019, and approximately $620 million deployed 
on acquisitions. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of 
$414 million related to the ongoing dispute with the India income tax department.
We generated $845 million of free cash flow in the quarter, and DSO of 73 days improved 3 days sequentially due 
to strong collections. On a year-over-year basis, DSO improved by one day. In the fourth quarter, we made a 
change to our accounting policy related to DSOs to better align with industry practice and better reflect amounts 
due from our customers on our balance sheet. Beginning in Q4, we started to net certain amounts due to 
customers, such as discounts and rebates, with trade accounts receivable, rather than reflecting those amounts 
as a liability on our balance sheet. This change does not have any impact on our operating results or cash flows.
Our outstanding debt balance was $738 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance 
on the revolver.
During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for approximately 
$150 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 548 million shares for the quarter. In 2019, we 
repurchased over 34 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion. Today, we are announcing a 10% increase to

our quarterly cash dividend, the second increase since we initiated the dividend in 2017. Additionally, the board 
has approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization.
Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the progress of the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, as well as the 
content work that we are in the process of exiting. Our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan is expected to run for two years. 
This program is designed to simplify the way we work, improve our cost structure, and fund investments aimed at 
accelerating our revenue growth.
As previously announced, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid- to senior-level associates from their current 
roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and continue to assume that 
approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to re-skill for new roles within the company.
In Q4, we incurred $48 million of charges, including $42 million of severance charges as part of the Fit for Growth 
Plan. These charges relate to approximately 550 associates, most of whom we expect will exit the company by 
the end of Q1 and we expect will result in a cash impact of approximately $40 million in the first quarter, with full 
run rate savings not achieved until Q2 for these associates.
We continue to expect the majority of the remaining associates to exit the company by mid-2020. We are 
managing this process carefully, as any time we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very 
seriously. Additionally, we continue to review our real estate portfolio as part of the Fit for Growth Plan and expect 
to take further actions related to real estate rationalization in 2020.
These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020, and are expected to result in 2020 
in-year growth savings of over $450 million and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million 
in the year 2021.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we began the exit of a subset of our content services business. Approximately 
$5 million of the $48 million Fit for Growth charges in the quarter related to retention and severance for 
approximately 1,100 of the expected 5,000 to 6,000 total associates to be impacted by the wind-down of this 
work.
We have updated our estimate of the number of associates to be impacted by the wind-down from 6,000 to a 
range of 5,000 to 6,000, as we expect to retain more work with these clients in other content and technology 
services than originally estimated. We now estimate that we may lose revenues of $225 million to $255 million, 
down from our previous estimate of $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our 
Communications, Media and Technology segment.
We continue to anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years, with an expected impact of 
$20 million to $25 million of revenue in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This is expected to be modestly dilutive to 
our adjusted operating margin rate, subject to the timing of the ramp-down and other factors.
We also continue to expect to incur wind-down charges related to the transition of these associates and any 
related assets such as real estate and equipment. We are working with our partners to transition this work, while 
continuing to meet our contractual obligations and providing impacted associates with a number of transition 
assistance programs, including retention bonuses, severance packages, and the opportunity to participate in 
various re-skilling programs.

At the time of our Q4 earnings call, we provided an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in total expected 
charges associated with the Fit for Growth cost transformation plan, including the wind-down of certain content 
work. Based on our actions to-date, attrition at the senior level of the pyramid being slightly higher than our 
expectations and less impact from the exit of certain content services, we now expect to be towards the low end 
of that range, while maintaining the annualized growth savings estimate of $500 million to $550 million.
Before turning to guidance, I want to comment on a potential change in the dividend distribution tax that was 
announced as part of the India budget a few days ago. We are currently analyzing this proposal, but believe it 
can, once enacted, significantly lower the cost of repatriating funds back to the US. The proposal is not yet law, 
but the expected date is April 1, 2020.
I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full-year 2020. For the full-year 2020, we expect 
revenue to grow in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year to $17.11 billion to $17.45 billion on a reported and 
constant currency basis, as based on the current exchange rates, we are not expecting a material impact from 
foreign exchange. This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 110 basis points to year-overyear growth from our decision to exit certain content work within our CMT segment. This guidance continues to 
reflect a muted outlook for Financial Services and Healthcare.
We expect first quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion 
on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth in the range of 
2.8% to 3.8% year-over-year or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 30 basis 
points for foreign exchange for the first quarter. This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 
60 basis points to year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain work within the content services 
business, which will be reflected in the CMT segment.
Revenue guidance for both Q1 and the full year assumes a cautious macro outlook in the UK, continued slow 
growth in Financial Services and Healthcare, as well as the previously mentioned impact of exiting certain content 
work.
For the full-year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16% and 17%, which assumes 
incentive compensation to be at target payouts. We expect Q1 margins to be slightly below the low end of the 
range, as we are investing in sales hiring, training, tooling and automation, and marketing and branding, while the 
timing of the savings from the actions taken under our Fit For Growth Plan and the return on our sales 
investments will not have reached a full quarter run rate.
As a reminder, our full-year 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payout, given our 
underperformance versus target. Our guidance assumes that in 2020, we will perform as planned, and therefore, 
incentive compensation will reflect target payout rates. This is a margin rate headwind of approximately 120 basis 
points year-over-year that we plan to absorb. The midpoint of our 2020 margin guidance of 16% to 17% therefore 
reflects approximately 100 basis points of improvement over the 2019 margin normalized for incentive 
compensation.
We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.97 to $4.13. Our EPS guidance anticipates a yearover-year decrease of approximately $30 million in interest income, reflecting a lower cash balance and reduced 
interest rates in both the US and India. This is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.04. This guidance 
anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 548 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%.

Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any; net 
non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses; clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to 
the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India-defined contribution obligation; and the tax effect 
of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes such 
as immigration or tax policy.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator 
Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Thank you. And our first 
question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Bryan C. Keane
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Hi, guys. I want to ask about the cadence of revenue growth in 2020. Looks like you guided 1Q 2020 revenue 
guidance 3% to 4% constant currency. The full year or fiscal year 2020 growth is pretty similar at 2% to 4% 
constant currency. So, is Cognizant expecting kind of steady revenue growth with no fluctuations or do you expect 
maybe a little bit of a drop in the middle of the year and a pickup in the fourth quarter? I guess another way to ask 
this is do you see an inflection point in revenue growth on the horizon? Thanks so much.

Karen Anne McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Hey, Bryan. It's Karen. So, one thing I would say is nothing particularly unusual. There's no large deals. There's 
nothing unusual right now from a seasonality perspective. So, I think it'll be relatively a typical seasonality. So, 
we'll start to ramp as we get into Q2 and in Q3. The one thing I would say where the back half might be a little bit 
stronger is because of the sales investments that we're making now, right? So, we launched that hiring program 
late last year. Those folks are coming onboard as we expected, and certainly, while we said we would expect to 
take about a year for them to start to ramp, but we should start to see a little bit of that benefit as we get into the 
back part of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. And maybe the only addition I'd make to that, Karen, is obviously the content moderation ramp-down will 
offset that somewhat as it grows throughout the course of the year.

And on the flip side, is there, perhaps, any heightened attrition you expect to see for the traditional sales force that 
was already there, given maybe the new compensation schemes or any changes there? So, sales force update.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. That was very interesting, because as I said, we were at a global planning summit in the last month or so, 
and the sales force were actually very motivated by the compensation changes because they can actually make 
more money than they could in prior periods. So actually, on the contrary, I actually feel there's a great deal of 
optimism in the sales force. People are – when the CEO visits clients every single day, it leads to a certain 
cultural demand on the organization, and I think people are motivated to get the company back to an accelerated 
growth rate. So, I feel good about where we are.
I'm not overly concerned about attrition in the legacy sales teams. We have had great luck I would say fulfilling the 
pipeline of opportunities. We don't break out on a quarterly basis where we are versus that hiring. We're less than 
halfway through the 500. I will tell you that. So, there's a lot of work still to do. But I track it on a monthly basis at 
executive committee and we're pretty much in line with what we anticipated in terms of costs.
I've also been keeping an eye not just on the accounts that these folks are assigned to, but also the pipeline they 
are building, and in some cases, I've been pleasantly surprised that the early pipeline builds have even been 
ahead of my expectations. So look, more work to do to continue to review that, but there's a lot of energy and 
urgency in Cognizant these days, and I think we're all very clear of what we're setting out to achieve, and I feel 
very good in terms of where we are to date.
The broader sales force update is consistent with what I said last quarter. That's not going to change. We've 
implemented a RAD model, which is retention, acquisition, and development. That's all about trying to get the 
right folks on the right accounts at the right time, aligning specialist resources which are by practice, such as big 
data or cloud, with a generalist client partner. The client partner is the quarterback on the accounts. They have 
decision rights. They own the P&L for the accounts. They can move with speed and accountability within the 
framework of authority that we have delegated to them, and they are complemented by subject matter experts, 
solution architects, and the like. We implemented that model on January 1. So far, so good. And we've obviously 
got to continue to push that in the course of the year ahead. But I feel good about where we are.

Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, Brian, one of the things you mentioned was that you're doubling the number of 
people supporting Cognizant's major strategic alliances, and I know that that is also somewhere where you have 
been spending your own time as well. Can you just provide a little bit more richness on where you're focused 
there, where maybe Cognizant is already strong, where you think there's opportunity to improve, and how that 
sort of fits into the overall updated strategy and Fit for Growth Plan? Thank you.

Yeah, I will. Look, we have, Lisa, some really strong alliance partners and partnerships by key verticals, whether 
that's Temenos in Financial Services, Pega, Adobe, or otherwise. But I've really spent a huge amount of time in 
the last nine months trying to build out and foster a business plan behind Amazon, behind Microsoft. We're now 
working through Google Cloud practice as the hyperscale players. And indeed, really selectively aligning 
Cognizant to some of the leading SaaS-type players, as an example, such as Salesforce or ServiceNow, or 
indeed, Workday, to make sure that we go to market with the companies that are growing 20%, 30%, 40% yearover-year.
It's not to say we won't continue to obviously partner with others, but we are putting – allocating even more capital 
to the winners in today's environment. That invariably means for us – just to be very clear, it doesn't mean hiring 
more alliance partners and having a bunch of coffee drinkers sitting around, feeling good about hosting meetings. 
This is a lot about building out business plans with solution architects and big data experts and the like, aligned to 
each and every one of those companies I talked about. It involves putting an operational cadence together on a 
rolling four-quarter basis, so I know in a certain date, I'll be sitting in the room with the CEO of that company 
reviewing not just what we're setting out to achieve as a company, which has dollar targets against it, which are 
intersected by country and vertical, but also looking at the pipeline shape, where we are in the funnel, and really, 
operationalizing that strategic alliance vision into day-to-day reality, which includes joint customer calls, joint inperson visits to clients with leadership of those companies, joint emails to clients or letters to clients, and the like. 
So it's strategic, but to be very clear, it's also very operationally inclined and pragmatic, with a view to successfully 
driving a [indiscernible] (43:02) cadence going forward with these clients and partners, and making sure we show 
up better than we ever have in the past.

Tien-Tsin Huang
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi. Thanks a lot. Everything looks in line, a little better than what we had. It was just gross margins that was a little 
bit different. I know you mentioned, Karen, the 50 bps sort of $25 million Healthcare write-down. Can you maybe 
quantify some of the pricing pressure you're seeing coming from the heritage work or anything else on delivery 
costs that might have surprised you? I know the Fit for Growth piece is coming in, too. So just overall, try to give 
some more color on the quarter and then maybe how the year is going to play out here in 2020 for gross margin. 
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karen Anne McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
I don't think in the quarter, Tien-Tsin, I wouldn't say there was any real change in pricing trends. But as we talked 
about on the prepared comments, you certainly are continuing to see pressure on renewals in the heritage or 
legacy IT side of the business. Right now, that's being offset by higher pricing on the digital side of the business, 
and – but certainly, we think we can do better on pricing in digital services and really make sure that we are 
pricing to the market and for the value that we are providing to clients. So that is certainly an initiative we have 
underway, as well as do a far better job on things like COLA and getting adjusted bill rates when people are being 
promoted or rotating our staff to take effect of a more optimal pyramid.
Certainly, the savings that we've seen so far have been primarily in the SG&A bucket, as we've been focused on 
the top end of the pyramid, most of which is down in SG&A. But as we move into Q1 and Q2 and further into the 
Fit for Growth program, we would certainly expect to see improvements in the middle to upper middle of the

pyramid as well, and also be able to drive improvement in some of these revenue levers, which will hopefully start 
to stabilize gross margin.

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your 
question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward S. Caso
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q
Great. Thanks. Brian, is your team now in place? I know you had one of your execs cycle out not that long ago. 
But do you have the people that you need down a level or two at this point to drive the transformation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Look, I'm a big believer, Ed, that A players attract A players, and the more we upscale and make sure we have 
the right team around me, those people in turn will make sure that they replicate that trend through the 
organization.
I will say we have gems in Cognizant, really, really strong leaders. I talked about life sciences growing double 
digits. That's an internal promotion that happened in the last year. So, it's always going to be a combination of 
complementing excellent internal talent with excellent additions from the outside, and putting a system of 
meritocracy and a performance culture in place, so everybody knows what we celebrate and what we condone 
versus what we don't tolerate.
So, of course, in the years ahead, there will always be refinements. I want to drive a performance culture. So 
we're getting there, but of course, there will be, even in the foreseeable future, ongoing refinements as we 
continue to attract better people from the outside to complement the internal talent.
I will say one thing that's very pleasing to me. There's no shortage of people reaching out to Cognizant at this 
moment in time, feeling both from clients and otherwise that there's a new vigor in the company, a new urgency in 
the company, and a confidence that we can get back to being the great company that we have been in the past. 
So, it's very encouraging to me to know that we can still attract great talent from the outside.
And in the same vein, with a new Chief People Officer, Becky Schmitt, who joined this Monday, who almost had 
two decades in Accenture, and most recently, had been in Walmart, we have a very strong people agenda 
program lined up in the coming years to attract, motivate, develop, retain, and put very sophisticated talent 
management programs in place internally. And I believe that that will not just make it a very appealing place to 
come and develop your career, but it will also have intrinsically a direct impact on our attrition rates, which, as I 
said on the call, I'm pleased with, but we can always do better.

Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States) Q
Hi. Thank you very much. Karen, just for clarification, could you tease out the guidance from a revenue

does that include some of the recent – very, very recent deals?

And then, Brian, for you, if you could just revisit on Healthcare and how we should be thinking about Healthcare 
cadence, both this year, and frankly, exiting this year. As the deals anniversary in earnest in the June quarter, in 
particular, has the price activities of the M&A clients, will that – has that already played out or will that continue to 
play out for the year? But just more broadly, talk a little bit about Healthcare, both this year and kind of exiting the 
year, how you see the opportunity there for Cognizant. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Well, I'll start with the Healthcare question, Keith, because actually, ironically, I've been on the phone with the 
leadership team of, as it happens, both of those combined companies as recently as this morning. So I'm pretty 
current in terms of where we are in the accounts and, indeed, the opportunity. And I will say, I continue to be 
pleased that we show up a little bit better than we have, and both executives and companies reassured me that 
the merger integration work is still there. And as they think about consolidating to preferred vendors, we're firmly 
and squarely in the go-forward strategy as well. So I do feel there's lots of opportunity for us even in those larger 
accounts where we're seeing consolidation from four to two in the last year, and we have seen some pressure on 
rates as part of that. But we do want to get back once we anniversary that into a stronger growth trajectory in 
Healthcare.
In the same vein, I just want to caution the amount of work that needs to be done. We've also had our Healthcare 
team today here in New York, about 20 people in a room reviewing last year, reviewing the revenue pipeline, win 
rates, margin trends, very strong call to action in terms of what we need to do in the coming years. So we're not 
out the other side on that yet, but I choose to be glass half full here in terms of – a lot of the actions we are doing 
are not specific to one vertical.
Better aligning marketing spend, making sure we have the right customer segmentation strategy in place, 
upscaling our client partners, making sure we have the best specialists in the world to complement them, going to 
market with some of the hyperscale players in Financial Services or Healthcare, et cetera, et cetera, that will bear 
fruits in each and every one of our industries, Healthcare included. We do expect still some, I would say, modest 
– we still have modest expectations for Healthcare in the coming year, but as we go through the course of the 
year, I'd like to think that we will start to make some progress.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Karen Anne McLoughlin
Chief Financial Officer, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
And Keith, it's Karen. Let me just comment on the guidance. So, for the first quarter, there's about 120 basis 
points of inorganic revenue baked into the guidance. That includes only the transactions that have already been 
completed. So, that would include Code Zero, but not the EI-Technologies transaction, as that has not closed yet. 
And then, on a full-year basis, the guidance similarly only for deals closed is about 100 basis points of revenue 
growth year-over-year, and that's down from, if you'll recall in 2019, the impact was about 200 basis points.

about 150 basis points on margin. So I'm just looking at the further needs to build into the digital era. And besides

the growth investments you've already articulated, are there additional growth-related investments that you'd like 
to start making in 2020, such that if you had more room in your margin plan, are there additional investments that 
you would like to make, besides the ones you've talked about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Hey, Rod. It's Brian. So, listen, the way I think about this, this year, if you normalize for, let's say, target bonuses, 
as Karen has articulated in this call and prior calls, margins would have been in roughly mid-15s. We've guided 
16% to 17% for next year, so call the midpoint 16.5%. And we're assuming, by the way, next year that our bonus 
structure is a normalized part of our cost base, so hence, organically, if you will, 100 basis points of margin 
improvement year-over-year.
Now, to your point, we've made reference before of $250 million-plus of investment back into the business. A lot 
of that, we call that explicitly like 500 head count-related to revenue generation. We're doing more on sales and 
marketing, we're doing more on training, et cetera. That's approximately 1.5 points. So had we not done that, 
margins naturally would have been higher. But I'm not here to try to operationalize Cognizant from $17 billion to 
$20 billion. We're trying to make this a $25 billion, $30 billion, $35 billion company in the years ahead. And as part 
of that, I think it's always wrong to look at one element in a continuum and shine a spotlight there and think, well, 
Brian, had you not made those investments, could you deliver higher margin rates.
And Rod, I've known your investment thesis on the stock. I certainly know that's not your intent either behind your 
question. What I want to do is continue to reinvest into the business. So if we can prove a strong return on these 
investments we're making, including the sales force hiring, if we get win rates higher, if we get a good pipeline that 
we convert to TCV and revenue, my inclination will be to continue to deliver and plan more of the upside back into 
the business and get us back into the Cognizant that was tried and tested for many, many years that made this 
company a great success over the years.
So, that's the intention that we're setting out to deliver here in the next 5 to 10 years. I'm confident we're doing the 
right thing. I will tell you, I'm really pleased when I spend a lot of my time with clients and partners. Our strategy is 
resonating. They see the renewed energy in the company. We have lots of work to do, but I'm very pleased and 
optimistic with the progress we're making and know, nonetheless, that we still have more work to do in the year 
ahead.

Jason Kupferberg
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hey. Thanks, guys. Just a two-pronged question on M&A. First, I know that EL-Technologies (sic) [EITechnologies], you just said, is not in the guide at this point. But assuming that that closes in line with the timing 
you're expecting, roughly how much revenue would that add this year?
And then, can you just comment more broadly on your M&A strategy? It feels like the frequency and intensity of 
M&A is picking up a little bit, Brian, under your watch over the past year. Is that an accurate assessment in terms 
of where you intend to take that strategy as well? Obviously, these kind of tuck-in sized digital assets really stand 
out.

Copyright © 2001-2020 FactSet CallStreet, LLC
Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah. So listen, a good question. I wouldn't say to date that the frequency has picked up that much. February 6 
last year, I was announced as the new CEO, so I started on April 1, and since then, we've done, until this week, 
two acquisitions, Contino, and then, prior to that, Zenith Technologies. It just so happens that we were diligently 
working to review our strategy and finalize that. And only with that behind us, did we absolutely go – now, let's go 
and put our balance sheet behind this to make sure we position ourselves strongly behind our strategic intent. 
And as I said earlier, that's a lot about protecting and optimizing the core, including scaling internationally, but it's 
also about winning in key digital battlegrounds. And both acquisitions we made this week are firmly behind the 
cloud ambition that we have, and you'll see more of the same on a go-forward basis behind each and every one 
of those digital battlegrounds.
To be very clear, I view M&A as a means to an end to achieve a strategy. While I'm pleased with the $2.2 billion 
we spent on share repurchases last year, you will see an absolute conviction to return capital to shareholders in 
the form of periodic dividend increases, as well as share repurchases, with a particular eye to offset dilution. But 
also potentially opportunistic, I will say that you will see us earn more towards accelerating M&A on a go-forward 
basis as long as it is supportive of the overall company strategy. Share repurchases, while having value, do not 
reposition the company against a strategic intent. M&A can enable us to do that.
So with almost a year behind me under my belt here in Cognizant, getting my head around the company, the 
industry better, the operational rigor and control we have with the team around me, we're absolutely inclined to 
accelerate M&A a little more in the years ahead and make sure we use that as a means to accomplish our overall 
company strategy.
With regards to the details of EI-Technologies, look, we've entered into exclusive negotiations. Deal's not closed. 
It is material for France but is absolutely immaterial from a company perspective in terms of the dollar addition, so 
it's basis points in terms of growth as opposed to anything else. But as I said, that, with Code Zero, is firmly 
behind our Salesforce ambition, and we've been spending a lot of time – I personally have met with Salesforce 
CEO, I think, probably now five times in nine months, and these are very symbolic moves to make sure that we 
strengthen our capabilities behind the Salesforce practice that we're building out.

you're taking to kind of get there, maybe some color there? That would be helpful. Thanks.

Brian J. Humphries
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. A
Yeah, it ultimately takes three portions. One is organic investments, one is partnership, and another one is M&A. 
To be very clear, Zenith Technologies, which was at the intersection point of life sciences as one of our really 
strategic verticals, as well as IoT, was a perfect illustration of hitting many birds with one stone: geographic 
expansion, strengthening European footprint, aligning through our IoT digital priority, and aligning to one of our 
strategic verticals.

We also announced and closed Contino, which has got a very strong international footprint in the form of DevOps 
and data in Q4. So, those are good illustrations. And of course, EI-Technologies, that we announced earlier 
today, will be another good illustration of strengthening our footprint in Europe, in this case, in France.
Organically, of course, we're strengthening our capabilities by building out more footprints and supporting that 
footprint with better allocation of resources globally. As an example, we will modify our marketing mix this year to 
shift much more towards our international expansion. In prior years, our marketing spend was actually less in our 
international business than the actual current revenue mix, notwithstanding the fact that our growth opportunity 
was bigger there. So, that seems to have been something that we wanted to rectify on a go-forward basis. And of 
course, part of the 500 revenue-generating head count that we've approved, a good chunk of that is in Europe, 
and we want to continue to go scale that to make sure we have a bigger footprint in those geographies.
And then, on the partnership side, whether it's with AWS or Salesforce or otherwise, we've been building out 
those linkages throughout the world, and Europe is no different, with a view to go to market in a digital ecosystem 
aligned country-by-country. I firmly view partners – Lisa asked the question earlier – as an extension of our sales 
force. We are working on some core banking deals at this moment in time, where the CEO of Temenos has 
actually actively engaged and brought us into deals and been a huge proponent of Cognizant, given our worldclass capabilities, behind Temenos. So, it's wonderful when a client hears not just from the CEO of Cognizant but 
also the CEO, in this case, of Temenos, as to our capabilities and our referenceability in that regard.
So, we're full speed onboard, full speed ahead to go scale our international capabilities. It was a little bit 
disappointing this last quarter but self-inflicted. We've got to get that right going forward, and it's certainly an area 
of focus for me in the coming years.

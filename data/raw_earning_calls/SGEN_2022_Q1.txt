Peggy Pinkston
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to Seagen's first quarter 2022 
financial results conference call. This afternoon, we issued a press release with our results, and that press 
release and supporting slides are available on our website in the Investors section, Events and Presentations 
page.
Speakers on today's call will be Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Simpson, Chief 
Financial Officer; Chip Romp, Executive Vice President, Commercial U.S.; and Roger Dansey, Chief Medical 
Officer.
Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the line for questions. And we aim to keep this call to one hour, and 
so I ask that you limit yourself to one question to give everyone an opportunity to participate in Q&A during our 
call today.
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future or anticipated events and results, 
including the company's 2022 financial outlook, anticipated product sales, revenues, costs, and expenses, future 
developments related to legal matters and potential clinical and regulatory milestones, including data readouts, 
regulatory submissions, and potential marketing and reimbursement approvals.
Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking 
statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and 
expenses, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertainty associated with legal disputes and 
with the pharmaceutical development and regulatory approval process. More information about the risks and 
uncertainties faced by Seagen is contained under the caption Risk Factors included in the company's annual 
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and the company's subsequent reports filed with the SEC.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Clay.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Peg. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. We are pleased to report total 
revenues of $426 million for the first quarter. This includes net product sales of $383 million, representing 27% 
growth over the first quarter of last year. This growth reflects strong product sales across all commercial brands. 
As we look to deliver continued innovation and develop transformative therapies, we remain focused on two 
strategic priorities. Our first priority is working to maximize the global potential of our products through commercial

performance and robust clinical development programs designed to support future label expansions while also 
leveraging our strategic partnerships.
I'll begin with PADCEV which has become a standard of care in the US for previously treated metastatic urothelial 
cancer. Earlier this month, we and our partner, Astellas, secured approval in both the EU and UK for PADCEV in 
previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The approvals are based on EV-301 trial, 
notably the impressive overall survival benefit. This marks an important milestone for patients in these regions 
who have previously had limited treatment options offering poor survival rates. We previously secured approvals 
in the US, Canada, Switzerland, Israel, and Japan, and continue to progress regulatory submissions across Asia 
Pacific and the Americas. We and Astellas are engaging with individual country authorities to secure 
reimbursement for PADCEV which can take up to two years, depending on the country. PADCEV's robust clinical 
development program spans monotherapy and combinations with KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy, EV-103 
Cohort K data which are anticipated in the second half of this year along with other data from the EV-103 trial 
could potentially support accelerated approval in the US for patients with first-line metastatic urothelial cancer 
next year.
We are also evaluating PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA in muscle invasive bladder cancer and as 
monotherapy in non-muscle invasive disease. These represent areas of significant unmet need and large 
addressable patient populations.
TUKYSA has become an important option for the treatment of second and later line HER2-positive breast cancer 
patients with and without brain metastases. Overall survival data and inclusion in key treatment guidelines reflect 
TUKYSA's exceptional clinical value. TUKYSA delivered strong results this quarter although we continue to 
expect competitive challenges in the US this year which are factored into our annual guidance. We are working to 
enable additional European launches in 2022 and our strategic collaboration with Merck is expanding TUKYSA's 
reach outside of Europe and the Americas.
TUKYSA's broad development program includes clinical trials in HER2-positive breast cancer, colorectal cancer, 
gastric cancer and other HER2-amplified or mutant tumors. Data from the Phase 2 MOUNTAINEER trial are 
expected in the second half of this year and could potentially support accelerated approval in the US next year for 
patients with HER2-expressing colorectal cancer. Although a relatively modest patient population, it represents a 
high unmet medical need as existing approved colorectal cancer therapies offer limited efficacy. TIVDAK is a 
tissue factor-targeted ADC approved in the US for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients and represents
an important new therapy in a disease with historically poor outcomes. Launched last September in collaboration 
with Genmab, the strong uptake has been driven by differentiated clinical data, positive reception from the 
oncologist community and our focus on commercial execution. We have presented promising combination data in 
earlier lines of cervical cancer which may represent clinical advancements and much larger market opportunities.
Roger will provide further details on TIVDAK's clinical development program which is designed to maximize its 
future opportunity in cervical cancer and other solid tumors while supporting global regulatory applications. 
ADCETRIS has now been approved in over 75 countries and ADCETRIS regimens are US standard of care in 
frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. More than a decade after its first launch, we and our 
partner, Takeda, continue to bring this important medicine to patients around the globe. Groundbreaking overall 
survival data from the Phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial in newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin lymphoma further 
demonstrate the therapeutic value of ADCETRIS and its importance for these patients.
In addition, a Phase 3 Children's Oncology Group study demonstrated an improvement in event-free survival for 
high-risk pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Both the ECHELON-1 data and the Phase 3 pediatric data

will be presented at ASCO in June and will be submitted to FDA this year. Lastly, we are progressing a 
comprehensive clinical development program to maximize the potential for ADCETRIS to benefit patients.
Our second strategic priority is to advance our deep and diverse pipeline as we look to bring additional drugs to 
market in the coming years. Disitamab vedotin or DV is a late stage novel ADC that utilizes our vedotin-based 
technology. DV active across a broad range of HER2-expressing solid tumors and demonstrates rapid 
internalization. Our clinical development program prioritizes monotherapy and combination approaches in breast, 
bladder, gastric and other cancers. We recently initiated a pivotal trial in previously treated metastatic urothelial 
cancer intended to support accelerated approval in the US.
Turning to our earlier stage pipeline, we are advancing several ADCs to both novel and validated targets. We also 
have four programs that use our proprietary sugar-engineered antibody technology. Overall, we are progressing 
more than 17 programs and products across our pipeline in a range of solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies. Our ADC collaborators are also making important progress with programs that utilize our 
technology. Roche recently reported that the CHMP recommended European Commission approval for Polivy in 
combination with other anti-cancer therapies for frontline diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
GlaxoSmithKline is commercializing Blenrep for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma and is advancing several 
clinical trials. And AbbVie was granted breakthrough therapy designation for their cMet ADC, telisotuzumab 
vedotin, based on data from their Phase 2 study for non-small cell lung cancer. As we look to the future, our plan 
is to continue building upon our four commercial products, advancing our deep and diverse pipeline and 
expanding our geographic footprint. We have over 50 strategic partnerships, including our recent collaboration 
with Sanofi. Based on our cash position of approximately $2 billion and no debt, we're strongly positioned to utilize 
cutting edge innovation to make a positive impact on the lives of people with cancer today and tomorrow.
Next, I'll turn the call over to Todd who will discuss our financial results then Chip will provide an update on our 
commercial performance. After that, Roger will detail our clinical development activities and pipeline. Todd?

Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thanks, Clay, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. I'll briefly summarize our financial 
results for the quarter which are aligned with our expectations and reflect significant progress across the 
business. Total revenues were $426 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing 28% growth over the first 
quarter of last year, this included net product sales of $383 million, an increase of 27% over the first quarter of 
2021. This was driven by strong growth of PADCEV, TUKYSA and ADCETRIS. First quarter 2022 sales of 
PADCEV also included $9 million in sales to another company for a combination clinical trial that they are 
conducting and which was factored into our 2022 guidance.
Additionally, first quarter 2022 product sales included contributions from TIVDAK which was launched in the third 
quarter of 2021 as our fourth approved drug. Royalty revenues in the first quarter of 2022 increased slightly to $28 
million compared to the first quarter of 2021. These royalties are primarily driven by sales of ADCETRIS outside 
the US and Canada by Takeda and to a lesser degree by royalties from sales of Polivy by Roche and Blenrep by 
GSK. As expected, royalties decreased from the fourth quarter of last year as the royalty rate paid by Takeda on 
its sales of ADCETRIS resets at the beginning of each year and ranges from the mid-teens to the mid-20s.
Collaboration revenues were $15 million in the first quarter of 2022. This included an upfront payment from Sanofi 
under our new collaboration signed in March, a profit share contribution from Astellas' sales of PADCEV in Japan 
as well as other collaboration activities. This each creates some degree of quarterly variability in our collaboration

revenues. Following the recent approval of PADCEV in the EU, we expect to begin reporting profit share balance 
next year from the sales of PADCEV by Astellas.
Cost of sales in the first quarter of 2022 increased to $88 million. This included cost of product sales and royalties 
for each of our four brands, profit share amounts to our collaboration partners Astellas and Genmab, as well as 
non-cash amortization of acquired technology costs for Takeda. R&D expenses increased to $298 million in the 
first quarter of 2022. This reflected continued investment across our deep and diverse pipeline to maximize the 
potential of our proof of products and pipeline programs.
SG&A expenses increased to $174 million in the first quarter of 2022. This is driven by our commercialization 
efforts for ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA, the launch of TIVDAK in the US, as well as investments to support 
ongoing country launches of TUKYSA across Europe. We are off to a strong start and pleased with our financial 
results. With that in mind, we are maintaining our 2022 financial guidance that we provided in February.
Now, I will pass the call over to Chip, who will provide additional details on our commercial performance and 
outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles (Chip) Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Todd. I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance, which set a new quarterly 
record of $383 million and covers four approved brands. PADCEV first quarter sales were $100 million, a 44% 
increase over the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the $9 million clinical trial supply work, growth was up 33% over 
the first quarter of last year. During its first year and a half on the market, PADCEV became the US standard of 
care in the post checkpoint setting. We look forward to a potential label expansion in the US into the frontline 
setting in cisplatin-ineligible patients in 2023. We're also excited by PADCEV's recent approval in the EU and UK, 
and look forward to working with our collaborator, Astellas, to bring this important therapy to patients.
Moving on to TUKYSA. First quarter sales were $90 million, a 29% increase over the first quarter of 2021. You will 
recall that our 2022 outlook for TUKYSA assumes the impact of competitive pressure from Enhertu's anticipated 
US launch in the second-line setting and inclusion in guidelines and pathways. This remains our expectation 
despite seeing only modest impact in the first quarter. With Enhertu's approval in this setting, we continue to 
anticipate a shift in how these regimens are sequenced, with increased use of Enhertu and less TUKYSA use, 
delaying patient flow into the third-line plus setting where TUKYSA is mostly used. Our promotional efforts 
focused on TUKYSA's strong value proposition, especially in those patients with CNS involvement. Sales in 
Europe continue to grow in the first quarter and we look forward to gain reimbursement in additional countries this 
year.
ADCETRIS first quarter sales were $181 million, an 11% increase over the first quarter of 2021. The team is
driving awareness of the positive overall survival data from the ECHELON-1 trial. The top-line data announced in 
February has been well-received, and we look forward to promoting a full dataset after the oral presentation at 
ASCO.
And finally, TIVDAK sales were $11 million for the quarter. While this initial indication is a modest opportunity, we 
are pleased with the positive reception from physicians and patients for this important new treatment option.
Now, I'll hand the call over to Roger.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Chip, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to share recent clinical development updates on our 
approved medicines and our pipeline.
Beginning with PADCEV, we are very pleased with its recent approval in the EU and the UK based on the overall 
survival advantage in previously treated patients with metastatic urothelial cancer as demonstrated in the EV-301 
trial. This study was positive at a pre-specified interim analysis and we plan to present important long-term 
outcomes at ASCO based on an additional 13 months of follow-up. In the front-line metastatic setting, we are 
evaluating the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA in two studies, the first study is EV-103 Cohort K, which 
enrolled patients who are ineligible for cisplatin therapy. The second is a phase 3 EV-302 global trial, which 
includes both cisplatin eligible and ineligible patients and is on track to complete enrollment this year.
As we look to muscle-invasive bladder cancer, together with the Astellas and Merck, we are advancing two phase 
3 trials to assess PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA as perioperative treatment. One trial is testing usage 
in cisplatin-eligible patients and the other in cisplatin-ineligible patients. At the recent ASCO GU meeting, we 
presented promising PADCEV monotherapy data in the near adjuvant MIBC setting for people who are cisplatinineligible. These data are important in understanding the impact of PADCEV as a monotherapy in the context of 
the ongoing combination trials.
Furthermore, we are progressing our efforts in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The phase 1 EV-104 trial is 
investigating single agent PADCEV administered [ph] intravesically (00:18:35) in BCG nonresponsive patients. At 
the AACR meeting earlier this month, we presented preclinical data of intravesical PADCEV in models of NMIBC 
showing minimal local and no systemic toxicities, along with evidence of antitumor activity. Beyond bladder 
cancer, we continue to assess PADCEV in a monotherapy basket trial of other Nectin-4 expressing solid tumors.
Turning to TUKYSA, we are pleased to announce that we recently enrolled the first patients in HER2CLIMB-05. 
This study is evaluating TUKYSA in the front-line maintenance setting of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. 
Patients are randomized to receive TUKYSA, trastuzumab and pertuzumab or trastuzumab and pertuzumab 
alone after completion of [indiscernible] (00:19:29) component of the combination therapy. Despite the excellent 
results obtained with the standard of care treatment THP, patients remain at risk of relapse and death, including 
the risk of relapse in the brain.
In GI cancers, we expect to report top-line results from the MOUNTAINEER phase 2 trial in the second half of this 
year, with the potential for accelerated approval in the United States next year. This study assesses TUKYSA and 
trastuzumab as treatment for patients of previously treated metastatic HER2-positive colorectal cancer. In first line 
CRC, we recently initiated a randomized global phase 3 trial MOUNTAINEER-03 comparing TUKYSA, 
trastuzumab and standard chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone. This trial is intended to serve as a confirmatory 
trial for HER2-positive CRC if TUKYSA receives accelerated approval in the United States and will also support 
future global submissions. Additionally, we are studying TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab in a basket trial 
for solid tumors with HER2 alterations.
Moving on to TIVDAK. TIVDAK has received accelerated approval in the United States for the treatment of 
patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. The 
phase 3 monotherapy trial in cervical cancer, innovaTV 301, is enrolling well and is intended to serve as the 
confirmatory trial in the United States and to facilitate global regulatory applications. As we look to move to 
TIVDAK into earlier lines of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer, we will present front-line combination data 
with KEYTRUDA from the innovaTV 205 in an oral presentation at ASCO this June. The study has also been

expanded to further investigate front-line multidrug combinations, including TIVDAK with carboplatin and 
KEYTRUDA with or without bevacizumab.
Beyond cervical cancer, we continue to study TIVDAK in other malignancies both as a monotherapy and in 
combination with KEYTRUDA and/or platinum-containing chemotherapy. The ongoing phase 2 study, innovaTV 
207, is evaluating TIVDAK in multiple solid tumors, including patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck. We recently presented encouraging monotherapy data in these patients, and we have now expanded 
the trial to explore the combinations of TIVDAK chemotherapy and KEYTRUDA in the front-line head and neck 
cancer setting.
I'll turn now to ADCETRIS. We are extremely pleased that two important phase 3 trials of ADCETRIS in newly 
diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma patients were selected for our presentations at ASCO. The first is data from 
ECHELON-1, which showed that its efforts in combination with AVD significantly improved overall survival 
compared with ABVD in patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. ADCETRIS was shown to reduce the risk of 
death by 41%, with a hazard ratio of 0.59 and a p-value of 0.009.
The second presentation will be of data from the phase 3 Children's Oncology Group study, AHOD1331, in 
pediatric patients with high risk Hodgkin lymphoma. The study met its primary endpoint, a superior three-year 
event-free survival with ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy compared to a chemotherapy regimen that includes 
bleomycin. We are planning to submit supplemental BLAs for these two trials to the FDA this year.
Turning now to disitamab vedotin, or DV. We recently began enrolling patients into the registrational -phase 2 
monotherapy trial in second-line HER2-expressing metastatic urothelial cancer. If we obtain positive results from 
this study, it could potentially support accelerated approval in the United States. We also plan to initiate additional 
registration studies in bladder cancer and HER2-low breast cancer over the next several months. We are also 
considering development and other HER2-expressing solid tumors such as gastric cancer.
Now, I'd like to briefly mention our early-stage pipeline. We are currently evaluating a growing number of drug 
candidates in phase 1 clinical trials across a range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Earlier this 
month at AACR, we presented promising preclinical data on two of our newest clinical stage ADC programs, 
SGN-B7H4V and SGN-ALPV. SGN-B7H4V is vedotin ADC targeting the immune checkpoint B7-H4 which is 
expressed across solid tumors, including breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer, with limited normal tumor 
expression.
We detailed the robust antitumor activity of the ADC and its immunomodulatory activity through induction of 
immunogenic cell death. We also disclosed preclinical antitumor activity at SGN-ALPV, a novel vedotin ADC 
targeting the placental alkaline phosphatases, which are expressed across solid tumors, including ovarian, 
endometrial, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer. We recently enrolled the first patients in phase 1 trial of 
these two ADCs.
I will now hand the call over to Clay.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Roger. Before we turn to Q&A, I would like to comment on our ongoing legal proceedings with Daiichi 
Sankyo. A jury recently found that Daiichi Sankyo willfully infringed one of our US patents with Enhertu. We were 
awarded damages of $41.8 million, representing an 8% royalty on past sales of Enhertu in the United States. With 
this verdict, we now intend to request that the court award a royalty on future US sales of Enhertu through expiry

of the patent in November 2024 as well as enhanced damages, attorney fees and costs. We anticipate a decision 
from the court on the future royalty later this year.
In a related matter, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted a request on rehearing and instituted to post 
grant review proceedings brought against certain claims of the same patent, which we intend to vigorously 
defend. Separately, we are engaged in arbitration against Daiichi Sankyo over ownership of certain ADC 
technology used in Enhertu and several other product candidates. We expect a decision on the arbitration in mid2022. It's important for us to defend our intellectual property as we continue to drive groundbreaking ADC 
innovation and develop transformative therapies for patients in need.
In closing, we expect to achieve many important milestones in 2022, including important clinical data readouts, 
global [indiscernible] (00:26:40) and commercial progress and advances across our pipeline.
With that, we'll open for your questions. Operator, please open the line for Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first 
question will come from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cory Kasimov
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Great. Thanks, guys, and good afternoon. I wanted to ask about TUKYSA. So, nice quarter. And just given the 
prevailing guidance you have here, I think it implies an average of about $75 million to just over $80 million per 
quarter over the balance of the year after you use the $90 million in Q1. So I'm just curious, how much do you see 
the guidance at this stage as kind of prudent conservatism until you see how market dynamics start shaking out 
with Enhertu [ph] versus an (00:27:51) expectation that Enhertu comes in and quickly takes a lot of share in the 
non-brain mets patients? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Cory, thanks for the call. We're really proud of TUKYSA and we have not seen any new approvals as you know 
on Enhertu yet. Our guidance includes an assumption of an approval later this year, perhaps soon, and an impact 
on the – especially the non-brain mets, exactly what you said. So, I think you asked, are we wanting to see what 
happens later this year, I think that's exactly right. I think it's a very – we're being very transparent that we – and 
we provided guidance, and I don't think it makes sense at this point to change the guidance. We certainly will if 
things happen in certain ways. But right now I think what you said makes a lot of sense.
Todd, do you want to make any additional comments about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thanks Cory for the question. And Clay, I'm happy to. So, Cory, the guide on TUKYSA this year as you 
might imagine, is a little bit of a tough one. We're doing great with TUKYSA in the current label, but we know that 
Enhertu, I think they've got a PDUFA in May. We're already seeing them in guidelines. So as this drug moves 
forward – the drug is very active in patients and is a great drug for patients. We think that as Enhertu reaches the

market gets approved that it will create a sequencing change in how these drugs are used and may push 
TUKYSA into a little bit of a later line of therapy. So, that assumption was built into our guidance, and we still feel 
like our guidance is very good.

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Okay. Thank you, guys.

Operator: The next question will come from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Salveen Richter
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Thanks for taking my question. I'm heading into the Cohort K data. Could you just frame expectations on what 
ORR is clinically meaningful given KEYTRUDA activity and to that – in that population?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, thank you for the question, Salveen. We are very excited about PADCEV and the opportunity with Cohort K 
and the rest of our trials that's where we're working, some of them are global trials as you know. And Roger can 
try to address this question and see what he can say, but we haven't outlined like a specific here's a bar, here 
what we need to get after. So, I know Roger will do his best to provide color, but understand we can't be exact. It's 
really at the end of the day, it's up to the FDA, and we would be remiss to try to say here is the FDA's bar since 
it's really up to them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Exactly. Thanks, Clay. So, just to add some more commentary. In terms of the patients that we've enrolled, they 
are cisplatin-ineligible. And so, the closest population you can potentially look at is a population that's treated with 
carboplatin – a carboplatin-based regimen. And for that regimen, the response rate would be expected to be 
somewhere in the mid-30s. We have obviously generated data with PADCEV monotherapy in later lines of 
treatment somewhere in the sort of 40% to 50% range. KEYTRUDA has a range of responses depending upon 
PD-L1 status and we have Cohort A, which was an initial assessment of both PADCEV and KEYTRUDA in the 
sort of front-line cis-ineligible population, which produced a response rate of 73.
So you can take all of those numbers, they're all relevant in terms of trying to understand what the landscape will 
be. But I think Clay is exactly right, we'll obviously be excited to bring forward the data we have. But in the end, it's 
an FDA review issue as to exactly what the bar is.

Hi. Thanks. Congrats on the strong execution in Q1, guys. Just a question on TUKYSA, so wondering when we 
may see some data with other backbone therapies, especially on top of Enhertu. Is there any reason to think that 
TUKYSA won't be effective with Enhertu or that the toxicities may be overlapping?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Andy thank you for the question. We're really excited with TUKYSA in many regards. We have other data coming 
out such as in colorectal cancer, and we have quite a few trials going on in different diseases. I think Roger would 
be appropriate to comment on thoughts in combination whether they're with Enhertu or other things. Roger?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Securities LLC Q
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Absolutely. So, Andy, in principle, right, the construct of Enhertu which is trastuzumab together with a 
chemotherapy payload, so inhibition of the pathway plus signs of toxic effects on cells is not that different from the 
regimen that was used in Enhertu [ph] plan (00:33:27) conceptually, which was capecitabine which is a cytotoxic 
agent trastuzumab together with tucatinib. So at sort of first principle, one could reasonably extrapolate that a 
combination of TUKYSA together with Enhertu may have some interesting efficacy.
With regard to toxicity, obviously, each drug has its own profile. Tucatinib as a single agent is a very well-tolerated 
agent and in fact can be taken for years, and that is an important attribute. We're generating the data right now, 
so I can't comment on what the profiles will look like. But suffice to say, we are interested in that combination 
because these are the two most active agents recently on the HER2 landscape, and it's important to understand if 
they may be potentially medically meaningful when in combination.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens

Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on EV-103 Cohort K. 
Thanks for your comments on the response rate. I understand duration is another important endpoint, perhaps 
could you help us understand what duration of response is clinically meaningful in this setting and is there a 
particular hurdle for that? And then obviously, the study has two arms, and I'm assuming if both arms succeed on 
response rate that there will be a comparison of the combination versus PADCEV monotherapy. Is that the 
correct way of thinking about it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Michael, thank you for the question on this. I'm glad you brought up duration. Duration is something that 
sometimes investors forget to ask about, but so important in making cancer drugs. Because if you have a 
response rate that looks good but it's not really durable, it's not that important to cancer patients. And we pride 
ourselves in looking at duration with all our products and making sure that they're meaningful for patients and 
making a difference in their life. And so, DOR, duration of response, is also important at FDA, and we know that 
acutely.
Roger, can you talk to him a little about the endpoint and the arms of the trial?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Yeah. So, great question. So, from a durability perspective, obviously, one of the hallmarks of something 
like a PD-1 inhibitor, such as pembrolizumab, durability of response is really a hallmark of immunotherapy. And it 
brings enormous value, as Clay says. We have generated duration of response in Cohort A and it looks very 
favorable. It's long, certainly longer than one would expect with chemotherapy, which is probably somewhere in 
the seven months, median durability, something of that order or thereabouts. But from a – we need to basically 
present the data from Cohort K, relook at that durability this – on first principles, every reason to believe that it 
could be favorable, but we need to see the data. The individual therapy, which is the monotherapy of PADCEV in 
that trial, there is no specific setup to directly compare, but obviously these are contemporaneously randomized 
patients. The main value we see of the PADCEV monotherapy is to more understand – or more clearly 
understand contribution of components. But that dataset will stand by itself as well. And so, obviously, when we've 
had that data out and we can look at it, we can make judgments as to the nature of or the quality and durability of 
PADCEV monotherapy.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Well, hi. Thanks for the question on DV. So, one of the things we really like about DV is it doesn't use 
trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is the name – the generic name for Herceptin. And that same antibody is in KADCYLA 
and in Enhertu. And so we've studied that, we know the internalization rate of that antibody, and we know that the 
antibody that's in DV has a very rapid internalization, much more rapid. And so, we think that's an attribute to that 
antibody drug conjugate. So we're excited for that product.
We've seen data that's already exciting in Enhertu – in patients at a low HER2, and we also know that DV works 
in combination with PD-1s, and we've seen data to that. And so, we think that that's also differentiating because 
some of the other camptothecin containing ADC – camptothecin type molecule containing ADCs don't seem to 
have yet shown that they work well with PD-1s, perhaps we'll see that in the future. But the data I've seen to date 
is not as compelling as I've seen the data with our vedotin ADCs in combination with PD-1. So we think that as a 
single agent, the rapid internalization is differentiating versus trastuzumab or the core antibody for the two ADCs 
targeted to HER2 on the market.
And the second thing is the combination with PD-1 also is potentially differentiating. So I think those give us 
excitement that this is a differentiated product.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi, this is [ph] Greg (00:40:12) on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question. So how are you thinking about the 
PADCEV and TUKYSA ex-US opportunities? Obviously, they are different economics between the two. But do 
you see any differences in their respective peaks and commercial dynamics relative to what we've seen in the 
US? And is the peak ADCETRIS sales relative to US? Is that an instructive comparison here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Thanks. These are really good questions. I do want to point out a few things that are critical to trying to address 
your questions. First of all, TUKYSA is something that in Europe, we have our own salesforce and we are 
prosecuting that and getting – gaining many approvals and trying to country by country get reimbursement.
With PADCEV, in Europe, we're working with our partner Astellas, and it's their territory where they lead the 
charge. So we lead the charge in Europe with TUKYSA, Astellas leads the charge in PADCEV. We love both
drugs, I just wanted to setup the ground rules for different dynamics there. With ADCETRIS, so that – those 
dynamics, we have the US and Canada, we leave the commercial sales for – and marketing. And outside the US, 
it's Takeda.
So there's differences with each of these drugs and how it's commercialized depending on who does it and what 
territory and what partner or we do it. And so, the opportunities for these drugs are strong. And the reason they're 
strong around the globe is because these are good drugs. And as you know, cancer drugs don't know borders 
and boundaries in countries and politics, it's – this is about patients. And it doesn't matter where they are, if they 
can benefit from our drugs, we're very excited about it and we want to bring our drugs to these patients.

So the ex-US opportunity for ADCETRIS is something we have a lot more experience with, you brought that up at 
the end of your question. And the ex-US opportunity for ADCETRIS is actually done well.
Todd, could you talk a little bit about how we look at it and what the differences are kind of economically 
speaking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. So let me first, [ph] Greg (00:42:36), say Clay is right. We book sales for TUKYSA in Europe and it's a profit 
share with the sales for PADCEV in Europe. So, a little bit different treatment there. I would say, in general, when 
you look at drug launches in the US versus drug launches in Europe, there are probably two things that I think are 
worth noting.
Number one is in the US, we launched a drug, you set a price, and sort of you're off to the races. And then with 
subsequent labels, you expand patient populations. In Europe, it's different. You get approval and then you need 
to go country by country to negotiate prices. In some countries, you can launch with, I call the kind of a provisional 
price, there are different names in different countries for it. But in some markets like France and Germany, you 
can access the market commercially while you're negotiating your price. In other markets throughout Europe, you 
have to negotiate a price before you're allowed to launch. So, what does that do to a launch trajectory? It tends to 
spread it out. Europe tends to be a little slower and how it reaches peak than in the US because you don't have 
these impediments to getting to the market. With Europe, you need to negotiate country by country, and that 
slows things down. Obviously, you want to try to focus your initial efforts in the key markets, which is what we 
have done.
The other, I guess, element that I would point out is typically European prices are lower than US prices. So, while 
there may be the same general number of patients in the US and in Europe, the pricing tends to be different. 
That's number one. And then number two, the rate at which you get to the market is different for Europe. And 
then, also typically in Europe, as you launch additional labels, your price tends to go down.

Thank you. Just one question regarding the arbitration decision. If positive, should we expect royalty also into 
November 2024 and also should we expect the royalty be in a similar range to 8% [ph] that mentioned (00:45:03) 
for the past sales from the jury verdict?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, Gena, thank you for the question. I'm really glad that you asked this question. It's something that we hope that 
gets resolved in the not too distant future as there's been already one court ruling on the patent infringement.

So let's address your questions. Let's start with the patent infringement. So the jury ruled and awarded us 8%, as 
you had mentioned, for previous sales, which is what the jury was asked to decide upon. That was it. Previous 
sales and it was willful infringement that was also in there, and that's something that's a public record that you 
know about. And so that's till basically the time of the court case for the patent infringement. The rest of it, and 
you brought up November of 2024, that's to the underlying patent that was being infringed. So we have – we work 
with the judge in that patent infringement case. And you provide information to the judge and you request that, 
and this is legal things, and I'm not a lawyer, but you request the judge to provide you with a royalty going forward 
till the end of the patent life. Now, this is still – I'm still on the patent infringement, not the arbitration. So I don't 
want anyone to get confused. And the judge will decide what the royalty is. I think the 8% that the jury decided on 
historic is potentially something that you could look at. But it's up to the judge. So, I don't want to begin to say 
whether the judge will do lower, higher or the same. It's really up to the judge.
The second thing, and the second part of your question, is the arbitration. Now, that is based on contractual 
issues that we had with Daiichi Sankyo based on our almost nine years of working together with them and 
teaching them all about our ADC technology and how to employ it. And so that is not subject -- we do not believe 
that is subject to the end of this specific patent. What it would be contractually would be subject to any patent life 
of those molecules that include our linker. And each molecule by molecule is usually most companies what they 
do, we included, is will patent any unique molecule and then you have the underlying technology, if you will. So, if 
they patent a new molecule using our linker system and that new molecule patent life goes through, let's say, 
2034, just to pick a date. Then what we're asking in the arbitration is for value through that 2034 time for sales.
And since they have quite a number of molecules using our technology and they don't have the same exact 
patent lives because they're different molecules that were made at different times, there could be a range of 
outcomes of times that if we win the arbitration, that royalties or some value thereof that -- I don't want to assume 
the judge will pick royalties, the judge can do whatever the judge wants to in determining value, and so that could 
be determined based on many more years than 2024 because it could be the end of the patent life of those 
specific molecules on a case-by-case basis. Also for those molecules, it would not be based on the US sales 
which is the patent that we're talking about, [ph] our contract with global (00:48:58). So for us, it would be based 
on global sales and that global -- those global sales could be over a substantial period of time that could stretch 
into 2030s depending on molecule. Does that -- I hope that provides you with what you need for understanding, 
Gena.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Yeah, yeah. So maybe just a follow-up question, so who would decide the royalty rate? Would that be like when 
the arbitrator make a decision, announced a decision, will he also announce the royalty rate or would you be 
negotiating with Daiichi about the individual royalty rate for each individual asset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Well, Gena, I want to compliment you on the question. So I don't know the answer to that because it's up to the 
judge. But I want to compliment you on the question because the judge can rule and decide there's a royalty rate 
and that's what the judge can do. The judge could decide there's cash or could be only cash or cash and royalty 
and a lot of different things that the arbitration I should say -- not just judge, the arbitration judge, not the patent 
infringement judge, can make a decision on what type of value that this should come to Seagen if he determines 
that we made our case and it was correct. So that's up to the arbitration judge. The arbitration judge could also 
rule that the linkage inside of HER2 [ph] and there are other (00:50:21) molecules is Seagen's. And the judge

could say Seagen and Daiichi need to work this out and come to royalty in discussion. So, it is not something that 
is up to us. It's up to the arbitration judge in this case.

Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, related to all the questions about the HER2 franchise, I think Seagen is 
in a very unique position where you have a HER2-targeted ADC and a small molecule. So, I'm just curious if you 
could share your thinking on how to take advantage of this strategic attribute. And along the same lines, I think 
Roger mentioned about the amplified and mutated populations. So, I'm curious if you're open to kind of sharing 
with us any sort of plans there as well. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Andy, thank you for the interesting questions. And in fact, we're really proud that we have a HER2 franchise with 
our small molecule and our antibody, targeting the inside of the cell and the HER2 -- through the HER2 tyrosine 
kinase is an important mechanism targeting the outside of the cell through an ADC, through an antibody that then 
delivers potency to the inside of the cell. We think it could come out and really attack the cancer cell and do well 
by patients.
And, Roger, perhaps you could talk about your thoughts on combining outside of the cell and inside of the cell 
targeting and other questions that Andy had on any populations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Clay. Thanks for the question, Andy. Yeah, you're right. I mean, we have two active drugs. DV already has 
an activity profile that's been generated in China and already has approvals in China. And so I think we have not 
disclosed any specific plans, but it's an obvious place for us to think carefully about where could DV be valuable 
for TUKYSA and in the opposite direction, where could TUKYSA potentially be valuable in a disitamab vedotin 
development program. So, we're busy thinking those things through, it's certainly under consideration. I would just 
reiterate the DV program, as we currently designed it, is basically taking and building off of the data that's come 
out of the RemeGen data from China.
So, for example, going after bladder cancer, it's a sort of an obvious traditional place to go for a HER2 agent but 
they have already generated very interesting data. So, we think that's an important point to take further and see if 
we can make something of that and turn that into a product because it's an open IND and we've already begun 
what we have designated as a pivotal trial, potentially looking for accelerated approval in a HER2 population. And 
then the other piece of DV which is going after the HER2 low is also based on data generated from RemeGen. 
So, those two things are we've sort of put out in the public are the obvious places to start, but there is lots of 
opportunity. And we're excited -- exactly as you say, we're excited to have two products in that same area 
because there's just so much potential efficiency and sort of synergy, if you will, in multiple levels for us.

I apologize. I got carried away talking about the two together. Yeah, we have a basket trial running with TUKYSA. 
So, we're obviously very interested in TUKYSA, trastuzumab combination across many different tumor types. 
Obvious ones would come to mind include things like biliary tract cancer, mutant non-small cell lung cancer and 
so on. So, we're generating that data and clearly from a strategic perspective, that type of thinking could be 
applied to DV as well. Again, we have not disclosed any of that information, but I can just assure you, we're 
thinking through all the possible opportunities both as individual agents TUKYSA combined with the trastuzumab 
approach and DV as a single agent and then potentially the two together.

Jay Olson
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Hey. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on DV, since you 
initiated their registrational trial of DV in patients with HER2-positive metastatic urothelial cancer, can you just 
describe the rationale behind prioritizing that trial over other trials? And then since you have Phase 2 data for DV 
at ASCO and HER2-negative patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, can you just comment 
on how those results may read across to the potential for DV and other HER2-negative tumor types? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure, Jay. Thanks. Very interesting questions. I will remind you that DV is an exciting drug in urothelial cancer. It's 
got great data and I believe it has breakthrough designation as well. So it's something that there's a lot of real 
information and rationale to go forward. Roger, do you want to comment about the other parts of the question and 
what we're thinking about DV in urothelial cancer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Yeah. So just to reiterate. In bladder -- in urothelial cancer, actually, HER2 expression is in a meaningful 
number of patients. Its biological relevance may be there. It may be an important component potentially. But 
regardless of that, it's a surface marker. And that's what an ADC needs to internalize. And so basically, as I said 
earlier, we already have an IND. We have breakthrough therapy designation and we have a trial that we have 
initiated. So, it's an obvious step from our perspective to take DV into urothelial cancer as a unique molecule. 
Because from the point of view of who else is developing therapies in urothelial cancer in the HER2 space, I think 
we're pretty much alone and that's important. Secondly, of course, the data that has been generated to date is 
really exciting. And so we think we can bring potentially another product with clinical value to patients with 
urothelial cancer.

With regard to, again, the sort of HER2-low breast cancer, it's the same principle. We see that as an important 
opportunity. Clay outlined all the potential differentiating features of the -- including the antibody itself, the 
potential combination with PD-1 inhibitors. We haven't disclosed the details of our development plans, but when 
we do, hopefully, that will be helpful for you to understand how we're thinking about this. You did mention some 
data being presented. I'm not entirely clear what you're referring to. But I would just say in general, again, on sort 
of first principles, ADC is require -- receptor expression on the surface that don't necessarily require that receptor 
to be biologically relevant to the tumor, all it needs to do is internalize. So, just as other molecules have gone after 
populations with relatively low HER2 expression. So we see DV in the same way.

Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Can you provide us 
maybe some color regarding the ongoing evaluation of the [ph] LV (00:59:01) and how that might advance going 
forward. And if you had to pick kind of like the greatest [ph] hits (00:59:08) at ASCO maybe a couple that are that 
could drive practice changes, maybe one that's a sleeper that you'd feel shouldn't be overlooked.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So LV is an active drug and we have this partnered with Merck and we've seen it active in a lot of regards 
single agent combination studies. We've been trying to find the best [ph] dose, schedule (00:59:33) patient 
selection line of therapy. There's something -- there's an excitement there but it is taking longer than we had 
initially thought to get to where we could consider a pivotal trial. We're trying to do our best there. It's a 
competitive and crowded space. And Roger could perhaps make a comment.
But I'd wanted to just talk a little bit about ASCO first. I don't know exactly what you're asking on ASCO. So I'll tell 
you what I'd like to tell you which is I think with ADCETRIS, we have a pediatric study that's very exciting and we 
have our front-line study our ECHELON-1 six-year survival data and where we really – we have a 41% reduction 
in the risk of death. We're going to show the Kaplan-Meier plots and all the data. This is both in patients – in 
pediatric patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and in adults with Stage 3 and 4 Hodgkin lymphoma. The data we have 
is – it's really life-altering. If you have those diseases, you're in those categories because ADCETRIS regimens 
work tremendously well. So we're proud of that and we're really proud to show the data which will detail the 
impact on a potential patient.
Roger, do you want to make any comments on LV or on the ADCETRIS data at ASCO?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. Firstly on the ADCETRIS, as Clay said, finding an overall survival positive signal in Hodgkin lymphoma is 
almost unprecedented. There's very little historically that has been able to do that. So, we're super excited by that 
data. With regards to LV, again I'll reiterate what Clay said. This is an active agent both as a monotherapy and in

combination with KEYTRUDA, and we've presented data in that regard. But again, as Clay said, it's a competitive 
space. We understand what the profile needs to be in order for us to trigger a pivotal trial, and we continue to 
work on dosing schedules. So we haven't disclosed any more information. All I can tell you is we're still working 
hard at that to see if we can create the right profile, the clinical profile from either the monotherapy or the 
combination to bring forward and test further.

Got it. And I guess just on the ASCO bit, Clay, your answers are just fine. In terms of the sleeper I guess, you 
guys have 23 to 24 abstracts. Is there anything that I might overlook that you think it's earlier stage but might 
make sense to really kind of focus on because you're feeling quite excited about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So many things are important in there to look at. So, I don't know that I want to just tell you one thing to focus on. I 
think the -- I'll stand by my comment that the ADCETRIS data is to me the most critically exciting.

Q
Hello. Thank you, guys. This is [indiscernible] (01:03:02) on behalf of Ami. [indiscernible] (01:03:07) question. My 
question is related to TIVDAK and early market movements. I wanted to know if you guys are thinking about the 
early launch of TIVDAK and how do you see the potential growth for it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Okay. Well, we haven't really guided to TIVDA as far as the growth for it yet, so we're not going to do that yet. But 
as far as the early dynamics, Chip, would you like to comment on the early dynamics in TIVDAK? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles (Chip) Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seagen Inc. A
Sure, Clay. So the launch is going very well. The physicians are very excited to have a new treatment alternative 
for patients, quite frankly, that are in really tough situation. So we've been really pleased with the current results 
we have for 1Q and we look forward to continuing to grow the brand throughout the remainder of the year.

Zhiqiang Shu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Great. Thank you very much for taking questions. I have two questions on PADCEV. On the Q1 sales side, it's 
very nice to see there was another $9 million coming from [ph] clinical trials (01:04:32). I guess for the full year 
2022, do you expect to see more sales from [ph] supplying (01:04:39) clinical trials? And then second question on 
the Cohort K side, we know it's a randomized -- two-arm randomized trial, what do you expect to see the ORR in 
the [indiscernible] (01:04:53)? The reason why I ask that question is, we've seen 44% in the [indiscernible] 
(01:05:01) already and if you can replicate the combination [indiscernible] (01:05:09) in the combination arm, you 
can see more in the frontline on PADCEV, how do you think that that's -- how do you think the importance of 
[indiscernible] (01:05:18) could be? Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So first of all, Todd, can you address the clinical trial question -- on clinical trial supply question and then maybe, 
Roger, you go into Cohort K and we can't provide all the data that you're looking for. Obviously, that will come out 
with our data. So we can't give you specifics and tell you what is required and what the line is and everything. But 
Roger can give you a general comment. Todd, can you talk about the clinical trial supply?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Yeah, happy to. As we said earlier, there was a $9 million clinical supply order in Q1. We try to call those 
out when they happen. I think if you go back a few quarters, I think it was maybe third quarter of last year, there 
was I think about a $7 million order. With respect to your question about guidance, that's typically not something 
that we try to build into our guidance, although I did comment earlier that this $9 million was included in our 
guidance because when we gave our guidance, it had already shipped. So will there potentially be more orders? 
Potentially but we don't control those. Even if someone said we might do it, that's not typically something we 
would include. We would wait to see them actually come in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
And then in relation to [ph] Cohort K (01:06:44) and PADCEV, you are right, in a previously treated population 
including exposure to platinum agents and PD-1 or PD-1 inhibitors, we have generated response rates in a sort of 
40% to 50% range, 50% range with monotherapy and we have not to-date had any data in in an untreated 
population. So I mean, I can't speculate on what that number will look like. We will need to generate and then we'll 
understand what PADCEV monotherapy looks like in that space. I would also just reiterate it is randomized, yes, 
which is important. Again, the primary purpose for the monotherapy is to understand the contribution of 
components for the combination. But that data does stand by itself. And so again, we have the chance to evaluate 
PADCEV monotherapy in and of itself next to the combination.

Joseph M. Catanzaro
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Maybe one quick one for me, so I think, Chip, you spoke about 
the delay of patient flow into the third-line setting with the adoption of Enhertu. I know it's still early but just 
wondering if you have any assumptions around when the new steady state of patients moving into third-line 
therapy is achieved and whether that new normal is something that might be achieved in 2022. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Chip, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles (Chip) Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seagen Inc. A
Yes. Thanks, Clay. Yeah. So it's a good question. It's difficult to actually kind of forecast that. First, they've got to 
get approval on a label and then we've got to see what that looks like to kind of assess the potential market 
impact. I think it is important to note that changes to the second line – changes to the second line regimen can 
cause delays in new patient starts in the third-line especially if that regimen introduces a longer duration of 
response.

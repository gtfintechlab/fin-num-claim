MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of 
Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the 
Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Sonefeldt
Vice President-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian's fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call. Thank you for 
joining us today. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike 
Cannon-Brookes; and our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's 
website. On our IR site, we also posted a supplemental presentation and data sheet. During the call, we'll make 
brief opening remarks, and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements 
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such 
statements are made. And we disclaim any obligations to update or revise them should they change or cease to 
be up to date. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are 
included in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the 
section titled Risk Factors in our most recent Form 20-F and Quarterly 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures 
are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in 
accordance with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to use of these non-IFRS financial measures 
versus the nearest IFRS equivalents and may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other 
companies.
A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release and our 
shareholder letter and in our updated investor data sheet on the IR website. During Q&A, please ask your full 
question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Also, please be patient if we encounter 
any disruption or challenging logistics given we're individually dialing in from around the world.
With that I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks.

Thank you, everyone, for joining today and for your continued support. We want to start by saying we hope you 
and your loved ones are healthy. This is a dynamic moment in time for everyone, including our customers and our 
employees. As you hopefully read in our shareholder letter, we had a strong business result in Q4 and the full 
year. We now serve over 174,000 customers of which 150,000 use our cloud products.
For enterprise customers, we are an increasingly important mission critical utility for enterprises going through 
digital transformations. Continued momentum helped drive $1.6 billion in revenue in 2020, as well as strong 
profitability and cash flow. As we turn outside to fiscal 2021, we have three parties to help up drive long-term 
success. First and foremost is to continue supporting our customers and help them stay resilient and successful. 
Second is to continue driving transformation into becoming a cloud-first company. Third is to make significant 
progress in our large end markets, agile development, ITSM and non-technical work management. Halp and 
Mindville, the two acquisitions highlighted in our shareholder letter, will help us across all three priorities.
Because of the macro environment and our cloud focus, fiscal 2021 will be a challenging year. We will play 
offense for the long term through the short-term headwinds. We will make choices other companies may shy 
away from going on our past experience to guide our path forward. In success, we continue our transformation 
into a $5 billion global software leader. We've provided more detail and many of our updates in our shareholder 
letter issued earlier today.
Before we move to question and answer, Mike and I want to both thank our employees who remain a source of 
strength and inspiration for us during these challenging times. You make unleashing the potential of teams 
possible.
With that, I'll pass the call back to the operator.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go 
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And I appreciate all the detail and some of the incremental 
detail that we're seeing in the shareholder letter. I was – in the shareholder letter, you guys did a really good job 
framing out kind of the impacts that we're likely to see from a more aggressive push to the cloud and the 
investment that you guys are making behind the new solution.
Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the other side of the valley if you will, what we could expect in terms of 
kind of average pricing per customer as they move to the cloud? What's the timeframe for realizing some of the 
yields on these investments? And sort of as we look forward to FY 2022 and FY 2023, what are the expected 
benefits out of these investments you're making right here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Keith, Scott first. I'll just talk about the macro of this and then James can talk into the specifics. As we said in our 
shareholder letter, moving our customers to the cloud is great for them and great for us. In the cloud, we can

innovate faster for them. We get – we can make improvements and get feedback from customers a lot faster. And 
for our customers, they benefit by now having to manage all the infrastructure and server – service there. And 
effectively, their total cost of ownership reduces significantly even as though we take on larger percentage of this 
workload. And so it's great for all of us. And James can speak to the specifics, I guess, about how things might 
change over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks, Scott. I would just add that the long-term economics in our view of the cloud are attractive, as Scott 
indicated, both to our customers but also to ourselves. And we see that in our ability to price in a way that reflects 
the value that we're creating for our customers. Of course, our customers enjoy the simplification that comes 
along with not have to – having to operate their own software and servers.
And what we intend to do over the medium term is help smooth the pathway for particularly our larger server 
customers as they embark on their cloud migration journey. We talked in the shareholder letter about how today 
we still have around three quarters of our paid users behind the firewall. And so we're looking to, in essence, 
provide discounts to our cloud pricing to these larger server customers as they make their migration. This gives 
those customers time to adjust their budgets to be able to realize these benefits around cost and complexity that I 
mentioned. So we're comfortable that, over time, this will be a good outcome not just for our customers but very 
much for our shareholders and our long-term growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe if I can sneak in one follow-up. So I was hoping you could give us a little 
bit more color on some of the recent acquisition and in particular how you think that changes your 
competitiveness particularly in areas like ITSM. Thank you, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure, mate. I can take that. How are you doing, Keith? Look, we announced the Mindville acquisition today in –
along with our shareholder letter. So I hope you've all seen that and again help, as Scott mentioned in the interim 
remarks, during the quarter. Look, I think it goes to a – both of these go to our long-term philosophy that there is a 
line between IT and software development that's increasingly becoming blurred. As the teams building software, 
the teams operate in deploying and managing that software are becoming ever more shared or collaborating a lot 
more and you can see that in both acquisitions.
It takes us further towards being the only company, I suppose, that has a broad platform for all sorts of technical 
team workflows. You can also look at Mindville specifically as just a part of our sort of steady, long-term progress 
of delivering more value for customers in the IT market. Obviously, with Jira Service Desk and Opsgenie and now 
Mindville and help there. It is as we've mentioned before the fastest growing part of our business that is operating 
at large scale and this will, we think, only kind of continue that trend.
In terms of Mindville specifically, our asset management or CMDB was the most requested area by customers of 
feature area, I suppose, in that offering as people were taking it beyond a service desk into a broader service 
management offering and it's a very prudent decision. We know the Mindville team well and I think we'll work 
extremely well together. You can see that also in the shareholder letter. We've cited the example of Balyasny,

which is a great customer example of large companies switching to the Atlassian platform for their broader ITSM 
needs.

Excellent. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Kurtz
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah. Thanks for the question, guys. So I think there's a lot of investor discussing intra-quarter about whether you 
would raise prices this fiscal year, fiscal 2021 given the COVID and the impact you saw in the SMB space last 
quarter. So it looks like in the shareholder letter you will be, pricing will be used. But maybe some additional color 
about the extent and timing versus prior years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, I can jump in and take that one. I think we should really start by focusing on how we are very mindful of the 
challenges that our customers are facing in this macroeconomic environment. And we've reflected that view in a 
variety of our actions over the last few months and pricing is another illustration of this point.
So, yes, there would be some benefit of price in terms of our overall growth rates in fiscal 2021 year-over-year but 
I would really describe this as a modest impact certainly versus the experience over the last three or so years. So 
I think that's very important to get context around.
And then I just further say that where we do move forward with pricing actions, it will be very much in support of 
our overall strategy that we've already been talking about today, extensively around accelerating the move to the 
cloud for our customers given the benefits to them and given the benefits to our long-term model as well. So, only 
modest benefits from price in fiscal 2021 and very much movements that will be consistent with our strategy.

Q
Thank you. This is [ph] Caroline (00:12:32) on for Heather. Just jumping on the different strategies that you're 
going to be using to migrate customers to your cloud product. I was wondering given that you list a number of 
them, I mean price cloud discounts is one of them, but you talked about partners, R&D, new product migration 
tools. I was wondering if you can rank order those in terms of like which ones do you think you would have the 
most impact.

And then also on the discounts for enterprise server customers, I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more 
color on the terms of those discounts and also like weighing that versus the fact that last year you did a number –
you did price – raise prices on server customers. I'm trying to figure out how does that impact the migration versus 
the discounts you're planning to give. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Hi. I can take the first question to that, [ph] Caroline (00:13:26). I'll leave the discounting section to James. 
In terms of the strategies, look, by far, the most important strategy is just building a kickass cloud offering. We've 
spent a lot of time and energy making sure our cloud products, the additions, the offering we have and all of the 
capabilities is the best Atlassian experience that customers will get. If we don't have that, all of the other 
strategies aren't going to be very, very helpful.
Second most important strategy, as we would say, is reducing the friction it takes for customers to move 
themselves over there in the long term and also giving them clear guidance about where we are investing and 
how we see that transition happening over time.
These are long-term moves, right, and customers make prudent investment decisions about how they're 
managing that. But at the same time, there's a lot of friction we can remove in the process. You've seen that in 
our migration assistance that we've [ph] shipped (00:14:27) and continually upgraded to allow you to keep your 
server and cloud instances running and live as you move your data over to allow you to do test runs of the data 
movements and all of these sorts of things, right?
All of these reduce the difficulty and the frictions of customers moving their data and their usage and their users 
across to those offerings which, as I said, we continue to make sure are the best example of using Atlassian's 
products. And then you have various other, as you mentioned, partner strategies, pricing strategies, and all sorts 
of other things.
I think that our long-term consistency on all of those areas is probably the most important thing next to building 
just a really consistent offering. You've also seen us I would say, in terms of doing that credit offering, continue to 
ladder out the different additions to cater to our breadth of customers that exist on-premise. So obviously, you 
saw the introduction of free in the last quarter, quarter and a half and then the launch of enterprise at the end of 
last quarter in the cloud to handle the needs of those biggest customers, it's still in our early access program but 
it's going very well so far. That addition map in the cloud is something we didn't have two, two and a half years 
ago and we've really worked hard to continue to build out in that to all of the [indiscernible] (00:15:51) customer 
segments that we have.
I'll pass to James with the explanation of how cloud pricing discounts work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I'd just say as you look at our list prices for our different deployment options, there's clearly a 
significant delta between the server prices and the cloud prices at different points along the user tier scale, similar 
but less so in terms of the comparison of list price between data center and cloud. And this embodies the recent 
price changes that we've made over the last few years. And so while there is this list price delta, it's really 
important that we work with our customers to make sure that they are able to focus on the total cost of ownership 
equation which we believe is attractive for them particularly when you add to that the very significant investments 
that Scott and Mike have been talking about us making in our cloud products over a number of years now.

So the concept behind the discounting that we talk about today is very much to give those server customers a 
multiyear ladder to gradually get them to the cloud list pricing and that gives them the time to work internally within 
their organizations, to sort through unlocking the cost savings, the complexity savings from not having to operate 
their own software but instead tap into our high-quality cloud services.

Got it. Thank you so much.

Operator: Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. In the shareholder letter, you mentioned that you would be 
making several short-term tradeoffs in addition to the greater discounts for migrating server users to cloud as well 
as the more modest pricing changes that you've been talking about. Are there other steps that you also plan to 
take over the near to medium term that would amount to some sort of economic tradeoff or does that essentially 
capture it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, I can jump into that one, Gregg. The other things I would just refer to really are the fact that as we continue 
to emphasize the cloud, invest in the cloud, help our customers migrate over to the cloud, of course, there'll be a 
reduction in the volume of our server revenues.
We talked in the letter about the license line which is now a relatively small part of our overall revenue base only 
$20 million in Q4 for example. That license line during fiscal 2021 reducing by about half. And then the 
maintenance line, so the annual maintenance per server customers staying about flat. And so, this is very much 
what we've been talking about for a while now as we emphasize the cloud, emphasized moving to the cloud from 
the behind the firewall products, particularly the server products. So, this is very much the continuation of that 
clear theme.
And of course, the maintenance line has been heavily benefiting in recent years from price increases. So, that's 
worth remembering as well. And I'd expect that theme around the license line and the maintenance revenue line 
to build gradually, so more of an effect in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. And then the 
other thing just to remind everyone off and I would say this is a smaller element of the overall equation, but we 
have been able to help a number of our customers who have been under particular pressure economically in this 
COVID-driven environment and we'll continue to support customers in fiscal 2021. So that's also a part of how 
we're taking decisions that help our customers for the long-term, yeah, impact us in the short term but we think 
that's absolutely the right thing to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz

Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I just want to follow on from James there, I just think without getting into all the specifics of all the different things 
we're doing, the way we think about it is just we want to be good stewards of capital for the long term and the time 
horizon where [indiscernible] (00:20:36) making those investment decisions on doesn't fit necessarily within [ph] 
any quarter or any fiscal year (00:20:40). And so we know through the 2008-2009 downturn when we invested 
throughout that, it really set us up for another decade of growth.
And whether it will start a license for $10 or – we celebrate 10 years at Atlassian and over the last year and a bit, 
we've had a lot of [ph] 10-year (00:21:00) Atlassians that we hired during that 2008-2009 and have been amazing 
people that went on the market beforehand and haven't been on the market for the last 10 years. And so we'll 
continue to hire and we'll continue to do things like free that set up our funnel really well. We'll continue to be good 
partners with our customers and generous with them in order to maintain a long-term goodwill. And so there will 
be all those types of things, most of which I think the meaningful numerical impact that we're aware of are in our 
shareholder letter. But that won't mean that there are the ones that we're doing every single day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregg Moskowitz
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC Q
Okay. That's really helpful and then a follow-up, if I may because that's actually a good segue to the introduction 
in March of free cloud versions across Jira Software, Confluence and JSD which clearly has long-term positive 
benefits. You already have talked about the uptake in users that have signed on to those free editions. But I 
guess the question is just around net new logos or net new paid logos which, obviously, were much smaller than 
usual this quarter for that specific reason. And I was just wondering because we do have a couple of things at 
play with the introduction of free versions and, of course, the pandemic, if it was possible to sort of estimate 
roughly how much your net paid ads may have been impacted by the pervasive presence of free perhaps by 
looking at the historical run rate of those net new customers who were paying for starter additions or any other 
way that you might be able to measure that perhaps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks, Gregg. It's Scott. We'll do Scott first and then James can follow up. Look, as you know, as being 
[indiscernible] (00:22:40) for a while, our new customer number bounces around a lot. It's not something that we 
guide to or we spend a lot of time on a day-to-day basis, trying to aim for. And in this quarter, we had an 
unexpected impact. COVID had some impact in terms of – with 174,000 customers we're exposed to every 
industry on the planet, every size company from large and small and some of those small customers change as a 
result of COVID.
The other part is free. As we said, free has opened the funnel but, yeah, it also defers the time period by which 
people migrate and upgrade to our paid instance of our products. And so that's along with conversion cycle also 
has some short-term headwinds against our customer numbers, but we're really quite pleased about that. Free 
itself was at 150% increase in sign-ups as I mentioned in our shareholder letter. So everything in that sign is really 
positive and, again, speaks to our long-term investments there. And as I've said before, it's [ph] not (00:23:47) a 
license. It's a similar program 10 years ago has paved the way for the last decade of growth.
James, anything you wanted to add to that?

James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Just a couple of points. First, I'd note that our gross new adds of customers, so adds before any consideration of 
churn, they were remaining strong throughout the quarter. So we are pleased that our continuing ability to bring 
customers into our products and services for the first time. But, yeah, churn, obviously, was what drove the lower 
net customer add number. And I just really echoed the fact that it was very much a blend between COVID-driven 
macroeconomic effects and the broadening access to free versions of Jira Software, Confluence, and Jira Service 
Desk.
I note on the COVID-driven impacts that we saw the greatest impact in April, less of an impact in May and then, 
again, less in June. And so if you take a step back and think about the macroeconomic impact and free, we 
believe that both of these drivers will ebb over time in terms of their headwind to customer growth. Obviously, 
we're not trying to predict the duration of the macro environment but at some point, that will ebb.
But having said that, I would expect that in fiscal 2021, the customer addition number would show higher 
variability for both reasons, COVID-driven and free-driven as we work to monetize those free customers 
gradually.

Operator: Your next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacqueline Cheong
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Hi. This is actually Jacqueline on for Nikolay. A couple of questions. I guess the first one is for James, in the past, 
you've told investors to look at revenue growth instead of billings growth. It seems like the growth rates have 
diverged even more recently. Can you talk about the puts and takes here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, thanks, Jacqueline, for the question. We do continue to believe that revenue growth is the best way for 
investors to think about our business. When you consider that now around 90% of our total revenue is recurring in 
nature, we're very comfortable that revenue is a strong reflection of the underlying demand for our products and 
services.
So one thing I'll certainly note is that the cloud business has a blend of subscription terms. So about three 
quarters of our customers take monthly subscriptions as compared to our data center and server businesses 
being typically annual-type terms. We note in the shareholder letter to illustrate this point that at the end of the 
fiscal year, about 25% of the deferred revenue was cloud-based, while a little less than 50% of the revenue was 
cloud-driven. So that's the only thing I would add. But we still very much focus on revenue growth as a very fair 
measure of our progress.

impacts to license and maintenance here. The one segment you're not explicitly mentioning there is subscription. 
Just wondering, is there anything additional you can provide for us and just thinking through the related 
subscription impacts that can just help us in thinking through the overall mix and offsets here going forward in our 
models?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, thank you for the question. I would just note that we would expect the subscription revenue line to continue 
to grow very nicely over time, both the cloud business and the data center business for those who need an onprem solution over the medium term here, a lot of opportunity in front of both of those.
On the cloud side where, obviously, we're primarily focused, we're seeing, obviously, very strong adoption in 
terms of those new customers coming in 95% this past quarter. And we're also seeing nice building volumes of 
migrations, and we expect that to be continuing in the coming years. So that's really the effect there. Of course, 
remember, we talked about the fact that for those larger migrating customers, we will offer discounts to smooth 
that pathway that I was referring to earlier.

Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This one's for either Mike or Scott. I read in the shareholder letter that 
there seem to be a lot of focus on server to cloud migrations. I'm just curious what role you see the data center 
offering playing at Atlassian long term. Is this a bridge [ph] SKU (00:29:33) until cloud can handle some of these 
larger customers, which seems to be relatively soon or do you plan to keep it around longer term even after 
customers are comfortable scaling with cloud?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yes. Hi, Arjun. I can certainly take that. Look, look, data center is a critical offering for our customers at the 
moment to make sure that the largest scale customers, as you said, can manage their own environments, right, 
where they have a desire to or a need to. There's no doubt that we're continuing to build out the cloud offerings to 
handle larger enterprise volumes, to handle the, obviously, increased need, right, in terms of scale, in terms of 
security, in terms of data locality, all sorts of SaaS-based needs for the large enterprise customers.
As you can expect, the slowest customers to migrate we think, over the long term, will be the largest customers, 
which will mean that data center offering is important for those customers for a long time, right? It also has to be a 
part of their planning, right? As we are clear with the customers about where the best long-term experience is and 
we help them to manage that migrations, at the same time, we have to be clear with them that those offerings are 
important and a part of their planning, right, both on the data center side and on the cloud enterprise side.
I would say that as part of our continued long term communications, we remain driven by customers in this, right? 
It's worth saying, we do get a lot of requests from customers that are large to move to the cloud, right? And so it's 
not a one way traffic at all. We tend to be very, very, very customer-driven and try to be prudent in how we think 
about helping them with that movement over time.

Walter H. Pritchard
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Hi. Thanks. Sorry to beat a dead horse on the cloud question. I guess in the letter you talked about a 60% uptick 
in cloud migrations, I think, on the server side. Anything you can tell us around sort of how much greater you 
expect the migrations to be in fiscal 2021 versus 2020? And any color you can give us around types of customers 
products and I guess you've already kind of answered the question on additions. But just curious, more color 
there especially on how we should think about the magnitude of the uptick of migrations into the next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Hi, Walter. Look, the first thing I would say is in terms of magnitude or in terms of migrations, obviously, 
we've continued to build out as I mentioned before the product quality and the depth and the breadth of our 
offerings in the cloud. So, one would expect that to increasingly point to larger scales of migration, right, just the 
sheer quality of the offering is improved.
The biggest thing that we've done in the last year is to continue to improve our Migration Assistant and working 
with partners both of which have had very positive impacts. The Confluence Migration Assistant for example 
shipped about 18 months ago I would guess, the first version. We've had two or three versions since then as we 
keep improving it. It now has more than 95% of all Confluence migrations go through that Migration Assistant.
So as that – as those Migration Assistants do the work, we have to keep tuning them and helping customers' data 
move through those Migration Assistants that really, really helps that journey become less [ph] frictionful 
(00:33:29). And then it's all about our communication and the customer's planning, they're going to move this 
quarter, or next quarter, next year or whatever, that's part of their planning.
I mentioned the Confluence Migration Assistant because it's our oldest and most invested Migration Assistant. 
The Jira Software Migration Assistant is a lot newer, so that shipped in March and we continue to work on how to 
improve that. That's only about 50% of migrations at the moment. So as you would expect, as we improve that 
Migration Assistant and the longer it's out, we'll see more Jira Software migrations in the year ahead than we 
have in the year behind.
And similarly, the Jira Service Desk Migration Assistant is in – I believe is in beta at the moment and will continue 
to roll out throughout the year. So I think you'll see increased migrations in the year ahead both through the 
offerings we have and in the Migration Assistants that's continuing to improve, as well as I would call out our 
partner network, right. Continuing to improve their capabilities, their services, their experience, their history in 
migrating customers because especially for those larger customers, we have an awesome network of partners 
around the world that help them to manage that migration. Maybe they're moving things along the way, returning 
the offerings to their businesses. So that's the human power that helps but takes some time to learn and get 
experience in managing those migration.

Ittai Kidron
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thanks. Great quarter, guys. I have a few questions. First on cloud enterprise, can you talk about what percent – I 
know it probably clearly doesn't apply to all of your customer base, a small subset of it, but maybe you could talk 
about how much of your revenue you think can be captured by cloud enterprise? And I'm trying to kind of gauge

first of all what percent of revenue is exposed to this do you think that can be upgraded? And also what – is there 
an average price increase I can think about relative to the premium tier that cloud enterprise reflects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
It's Scott here. Thanks for the question. I'd take you back to, I guess, our principles, which is we want to be able to 
serve all our customers in cloud. And we have our free editions for the very smallest of teams. And until recently it 
was [ph] just for any (00:35:56) standard. And as we look to make sure we can handle these customers, we have 
gone to premium and now enterprise.
Now enterprise is still in a closed beta with customers. So, we're not in a stage where we could talk to overall 
customer demand or specific pricing on that product. But when we think about it, enterprise use – [ph] target at 
the largely to the (00: 36:21) customers that have very specific needs around data locality, performance, scale 
and other things that – where we believe we can provide a specific offering for those customers.
So, I guess too soon to kind of answer specifically your questions but we're committed to handling all of our 
customers including the very largest of customers in cloud. And as I've said before, that we save a lot of money 
for those customers by handling the total cost of ownership because we can run it cheaper and better than they 
can.

Robert Majek
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Thanks. Can you share some feedback from the partner channel, which represents a quarter of total revenue, on 
how they're evolving their practices as you accelerate the shift towards cloud products?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure, I can take that one [ph] Matt (00:37:16). Look, I think any large scale shift in our business like this is going 
to impact the partner channel, right? So you clearly hear that in that feedback. They're used to working out how to 
help customers in a certain manner and they're having to evolve and helping them in a different manner. This 
creates opportunities and creates challenges for them and you get both in the feedback.
For example, as I mentioned, migration services for the last year or two, in the next few years, will be a good 
source of revenue for our partners in terms of helping our customers to move not just sheerly picking up the data 
and running the Migration Assistant which the customers can probably do themselves. But in terms of how should 
they think about their business which is probably changed in the cloud. Like do they need to think differently, do 
they need to set it up differently, do they need to manage it differently in terms of doing that.
Second, the offerings like cloud enterprise and the new extensibility capabilities we have in the cloud are very 
exciting for partners. They create a lot more opportunities in the cloud world to manage the customer's instances, 
manage how they do things. Again, cloud enterprise being multi-instance so you can set up as many Jira 
instances as you want to manage your work, creates a lot more flexibility for the customer in terms of data 
management. How they want to manage projects, how they manage your content in Confluence and the partner 
can help them manage that to map it closer than ever before to their business to make it better fit.

So, I would say, as a whole, although the partners have made huge strides already in managing that transition in 
their business that they continue to work with us and we continue to communicate very much so how that's going 
to change and work alongside them as we go in that direction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Just want to add something, Mike did a great job explaining but it sometimes gets lost how much of an asset our 
global partner channel is. We have just a huge range of partners tackling verticals and those partners are also key 
in our marketplace which has been a huge strength for us and creates stickiness in our product. And they've done 
a great job of building those marketplace apps in our cloud. And of course that allows them to be more sticky.
So, I'm glad you brought up the question because it does speak to the huge benefit we have of this global partner 
channel and particularly where we don't have to have post sales, professional services people on the ground 
around the world and we can leverage our partner channel to do that is a huge source of strength for us.

Luv Sodha
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. I had a couple of questions. First one for Mike and Scott was around the 
R&D investment. It sounds like you guys are still going to keep the hiring speed up in fiscal 2021. And this year, 
you guys had an impressive – you had the free cloud editions, you launched premium, so like what are sort of 
feature sets that this R&D investment is going to be focused on going forward?
And then the second one was around the demand pipeline. So, I know James you provided some color around 
the demand pipeline seeing the most impact from COVID-19 in April, and then improving sequentially. So, what 
has been implied in the guidance for the first fiscal quarter that you provided? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Good day, mate, great question. Look, I think we've obviously got the COVID background as we've talked 
about, right. And whether the recovery sort of slowly comes back like a marshmallow or snaps back quickly like a 
rubber band, that is – that's out of our control. However, what is in control is our ability to continue to invest 
prudently and for the long term so that we can come out of this strongly however that happens.
In terms of where the R&D dollars are going, that doesn't change, right, and it shouldn't change because of 
COVID or any background circumstances. So as we continue to say, we're trying to build an amazing platform for 
helping teams work across lots of different markets. You see that obviously going into the cloud platform 
continuing to build out the enterprise capabilities there, as well as on things like free and helping the smallest of 
customers get started and just make their teams more efficient, right. That doesn't change.
We continue to have some amazing opportunities in terms of the markets ahead of us in software, in [ph] IT 
(00:42:34) and connecting those two markets as well as we've seen with the Mindville acquisition that we 
announced today, as well as in the broader work management for all teams aspect. Trello continues to power 
along really well and we're happy with how that's going. Confluence continues to become a broader offering and 
we continue to work on our overall platform of tying things together.

So just high level, we're really excited about the way we're investing our R&D. We do think about that in the long 
term and as Scott mentioned earlier, we're continuing to invest in hiring and in acquiring the best talent that we 
can into the business so we can build things for our customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
And I can just add on to the second part of your question. In terms of the COVID impact that we saw in Q4, I peg 
that at around $10 million in revenue in the quarter and that was predominantly on the cloud side of our business 
which you would expect. That's where we tend to serve a small, medium sized business type customers. We saw 
some weakness there particularly around some of the smaller tech companies that we serve. And then of course 
particular industries were heavily impacted by COVID-19 and we saw impacts right across the customer size 
spectrum within those impacted sectors. So, around $10 million for the quarter. That includes a subset of that $10 
million relates to some of the help that we gave to certain of our customers. Although I'll note it was a relatively 
small proportion, less than 2% or so of our customers came to us for one form of help or another.
Looking to fiscal 2021, we're assuming. Again, we're obviously not trying to take a call on the macro or on the 
timing of the trajectory of COVID but we're assuming that there would be effects throughout fiscal 2021. So netnet, it would be a bigger effect in fiscal 2021 than what we've seen to-date.

Q
Thank you so much. This is [ph] Joey (00:44:55) on for Pat. Just two quick ones from me. First, how do you think 
about M&A going forward? And then maybe on the COVID impact, can you maybe touch on what you saw in July 
and how that compared to June? Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Scott here, I'll take the M&A question, James can take the COVID impact one. The – look, I mean, M&A hasn't 
changed for us. We've always viewed M&A as one of the areas that we are great at along with building and 
developing new products, along with our marketplace, third party apps that we provide to our customers. It's sort 
of I guess one arrow in our quiver that we can deploy and nothing's changed. We believe that the most important 
thing companies need to have that we're interested in looking at is that they align with our mission, that they –
around unleashing the potential of every team. And then it's culture fit and other areas. So, and we're really proud 
about M&A. And we've always been prudent stewards of capital and that hasn't change through COVID.
Like always, if there's opportunities to buy things at a reasonable price that makes sense and add to our product 
portfolio in areas that we're already looking at, we will do that. I will say that the valuations haven't come down as 
much as many people expected during this time. And we're in no rush to sort of go and deploy capital in areas 
where we don't believe we can get a great return. James?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah, I'd just add that we've been discussing how the challenging impacts of COVID lessened as Q4 progressed. 
I would just observe that in July, so far, we've seen a continuation of that theme. But I really would want to

emphasize it's early in the quarter and I'd be not looking to draw too many conclusions here. Obviously, the macro 
factors are really hard to predict and we've seen economic openings in certain geographies followed by less or 
more restrictive economic conditions. So that's what we've seen so far. But I would be very cautious about going 
too far with that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company Q
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about business outside of SMB, outside of distressed verticals and 
maybe looking at your more stable verticals and your more enterprise type customers. And I'm curious given the 
impact from kind of worker displacement and supporting hybrid work enablement, what you're seeing from a 
demand perspective, you could argue maybe investments in collaboration and workflow would rise but you could 
also argue companies still are very much in tactical mode. So would like to hear how you're seeing conditions in 
better-performing verticals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I can start on that one, and then Scott and Mike perhaps you want to jump in. But we feel as though we are very 
much in the center of important transformations, digital transformation is only being accelerated by the 
macroeconomic developments that have played out in recent months and we feel that our products and services 
hit that need for where our customers are going.
And I would just also add how we were very pleased up at the larger enterprise end of our customer base. As to 
the large spending statistics that we published, we've traditionally published numbers for customer spending more 
than $50,000 and $500,000 with us and those customer accounts grew by 44% and 56% year-over-year. And 
then a new statistic for us as we continue to scale is the number of customers spending more than $1 million with 
us and so we were delighted with that number increasing by 76% year-over-year. So, I think illustrative of the 
breadth of what we have to offer, the relevance of what we have to offer. I'll leave it at that.

Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Just two quick ones. First diving a little bit more into the 
churn discussion. You mentioned in the past that your retention rates are about 98% of those customers spending 
over $5,000. Has that been consistent during COVID or has there been changes with – again, the customers are 
on larger bills versus just a total customer as a whole, kind of as a whole. And then on the cloud revenue side, in 
the shareholder letter, you said slightly less than half of revenue is cloud. To be clear, that's just the actual cloud 
revenue, that's not including marketplace, correct? Because then that's telling us that about 80% of that 
subscription bucket would be actual cloud which definitely a lot higher than I expected but I just want to get a 
sense. Is that directionally the right way to think about that? Thanks.

So, in terms of the last part of your question, the cloud commentary, obviously directional rather than terribly 
specific. Recall obviously that the marketplace has been growing nicely for us on the cloud. But traditionally, the 
marketplace has grown up around server and the data center apps were growing very nicely in the last year and a 
half or so. So we expect more growth to come on the cloud side of our marketplace but that's a smaller 
component today of that overall [ph] at that line (00:51:16) revenue mix. Then the other element of your question, 
if you want to come back to that?

Thanks for taking the question, appreciate it. One follow-on on the large deals or growing customers spending 
more than $1 million. Could you give an update on what's driving that, any update on Jira Align, and as you look 
into FY 2021, Cameron as Chief Revenue Officer any changes to go-to-market strategy you're contemplating with 
your own direct sales force or with partners? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks. There's nothing to change in our go-to-market strategy. Over the long term, we don't expect it to have 
any U-turns in the near term either. Our go-to-market has always been land customers bottoms up and where 
they need help, assistance, we provide that for them.
Over time, as the deal sizes get larger, their engagement with us, they want a sort of person to talk to. But that 
engagement is almost always after they're already a long-term customer of Atlassian and they're looking to 
expand either to a mission-critical data center instance or Jira Align, reporting up into the C-suite.
I've spent a lot of time with [ph] e-customers (00:52:59) recently with – that are engaging with our Jira Align 
product and what we're seeing there is that digital transformation is a CEO level and board level concern amongst 
many of our customers and they are still very early in the digital transformation roadmaps. Many have engineering 
teams but they've been working in a waterfall fashion. They're not moving fast enough to keep up with today's 
demands. And so they're looking to vendors like ourselves to help them unify all their dev teams from the moment 
they come up with an idea all the way through to launch and maintaining it and running it and so that involves our 
entire product suite.
And as they look to do that at large scale, they need products like Jira Align to manage their portfolio of often 
thousands if not tenths of thousands of developers they have building products for them. So, in short, no changes 
to our go to market and we see again all of our product portfolio playing out as we expected, which is we are the 
only vendor that can handle both end-to-end and the scale that our customers are operating at.

Rishi asked the retention rate for customers north of $50,000. And I just wanted to say it's been holding steady 
through the COVID challenges. So, continued retention among the large customers we're happy with, as we

Jack Andrews
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. During the quarter, you announced a variety of integrations 
between some of your products and third party DevOps tools. And so just philosophically speaking, I mean how 
much do you think of the DevOps lifecycle that you're interested in addressing directly versus partnering with 
other third parties?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Scott here. I appreciate the question, Jack. If I look at – I chat with customers and explain what we do, there's a 
lot of – if you think about the broad market, there is plan and manage kind of what are we going to get done 
across our organization. And in that space Jira and now Jira Align and other products are totally ubiquitous. 
They're – you then have what – kind of writing code, testing code, deploying code. And in that space, there are 
thousands of different vendors and different start-ups happening every single day. And Atlassian plays a really 
important part there with our coding tools, with our deployment tools and so forth. But there are – our commitment 
to our customers in that space is that we will integrate with everything in that space. And [ph] within (00:56:31) 
that space because of our market presence and our customer base, they are incentivized to integrate with us.
And so our brand promise in that space is we have things for you and we have some of the most important pieces 
in that space. But I think it's silly for any vendor to promise to be all things to all people in that space given how 
quickly technology changes and how people write code evolves over time. And then at the other – sort of the very 
end of that when we say, okay, I want to manage, run and support these products, that's where we've increasingly 
been spending time with all of the ITSM investments with Jira Service Desk, with Opsgenie that alerts people 
when you have issues. And so in that area, we know we're still in the stage where every time we add a feature, 
we gain more market share there, it's still very early.
But what customers look to us across all of this is that they want effectively a single pane of glass that tells them 
where are they spending time, how are they managing these huge amounts of people that are involved in digital 
transformation with their writing code or their designing user interfaces or their frontline support people when the 
products go down in the middle of the night, they want something that coordinates all that work. And we're the 
only vendor that can do that end to end.
And so the integrations we announced in DevOps were a part to that and like, effectively demonstrating again like 
no other vendor can do that we are that single pane of glass no matter what you use at a sort of detailed level 
DevOps whether you use our products or you use a third party, Atlassian is the only vendor that can sort of go up 
to the C-suite and then down to the people writing code like in the trenches.

hope you can see that in our shareholder letters. We're a long-term thinking people, we've got a long-term 
thinking business and we believe that the shareholder letter as much as anything else is about philosophy of how 
we think about the world.
I think you can see over the last almost 20 years now and you will see continuing on, we're extremely pro 
interoperability. So you asked about integrations and how that works, while we obviously make sure our own 
applications work incredibly well together, we are – we think it's incredibly important as software continues to 
evolve that interoperability between the best of breed vendors, between all vendors that customers show up with 
is incredibly important. You've seen that in our partnerships continuing to evolve with Slack and with Zoom and 
with Dropbox all of which I believe we had announcements within this quarter and continue to work well with the 
thousands of different integrations that we have.
This also plays well into our cloud journey because integration and interoperability in the cloud is even easier than 
it was on – in the on premise world because of the standardized endpoints. No one has to upgrade their software. 
It's all running on the latest versions. So, we think that's going to be an increasingly important part of our story.
As Scott mentioned in development, in IT areas but increasingly in work management for all and every area and I 
think that's a really good philosophical stance for us to have and only increasing as a strength of ours going 
forward.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
One of our goals in the past several years has been to return to a position of offensively investing in our existing businesses, paying a growing
dividend and also buying back meaningful amounts of stock. So I'm pleased to report that we have now achieved all of that in this quarter, and
we are back to our desired leverage ratios.
Our Cable division continues to be a standout, delivering over 7% revenue growth and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth
up 10% fueled by our broadband business, which generated 300,000 net additions and contributed to a very healthy 255,000 net new customer
relationships. Business services has emerged from the pandemic and was also a key driver of our results. And we believe this momentum will
continue.
Our success comes from our network advantage, innovative products and world-class operational capabilities, which enable us to provide an
unparalleled experience. Just like in residential, we are proactively responding to the needs of our commercial customers and offering personalized
solutions.
While small business has led our growth for the last decade, we are still significantly underpenetrated in the mid-market and enterprise segments.
We see a lot of potential to take share in our large addressable market, which just got even bigger post our recent acquisition of Masergy, which
builds on our strong offering of technology solutions. Masergy has become a leading provider to companies worldwide and unlocks a customer
segment that we don't have today, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global operations.
Xfinity Mobile exceeded its prior record, adding 285,000 lines, the most in any quarter since launch. And we continue to evaluate ways we can
accelerate this business even further as wireline and wireless connectivity services continue to converge.
We are looking at new exciting products and packaging that highlight how we're able to provide our customers with the best and most reliable
broadband wherever they are or wherever they go and help them save money at the same time. And with only 6% penetration of our 32 million
broadband customers, we have a long runway.
Taking all of this together, we have an incredibly robust broadband business, and we've been adding over 1 million broadband customers each
year for the past 20-plus years. And we continue to deepen these relationships by offering a fantastic and differentiated in-home experience with
the fastest modem and gateway and the greatest WiFi coverage. We plan to continue our relentless focus on aggressively developing and improving
our suite of products around connectivity.
The foundation of all of this is our network. And we are currently in the process of deploying new technology, updating key infrastructure and
accelerating virtualization across our footprint so that we can deliver even further enhancements fast and at scale to millions of customers. And
we will continue to evaluate every opportunity we have to expand our passings, which will bring our amazing suite of products and services to
many new homes and businesses.
All of Dave Watson and his team's superb execution is around decades of investment that has led to constant new product innovation, including
this month's launch of XClass TV, an extension of our leadership in video aggregation. XClass is an innovative smart television powered by our
global technology platform that brings the best of our company's entertainment operating system to consumers nationwide together with the
option to use either Xfinity, Charter or other entertainment apps.
At NBCUniversal, we continue to see great progress in each of our businesses, but I'd like to highlight our theme parks, especially Orlando, which
just reported the most profitable quarter in its history despite having virtually no international guests due to COVID-related travel restraints.
In Hollywood, we continue to see recovery, and we had a very successful and exciting opening of Universal Beijing Resort on September 20th. I
also look forward to COVID-related restrictions easing in Osaka, which could happen soon.
Our Media business is also doing very well. We're benefiting from the many changes Jeff Shell and his team implemented starting in 2020 with
new hires, different roles, fresh content and a more efficient operating structure. We're seeing the financial success in both our linear networks as

well as Peacock, which has maintained its momentum. We have a new breakout hit with La Brea, which has been a contributor to NBC's overall
audience lead this primetime season as well as the best-performing new show on Peacock.
Sunday Night Football has returned with great momentum, which we're seeing across our platforms. And we're thrilled with the performance of
our second Halloween installment, which generated more revenue in its opening weekend at the domestic box office than any other film this year
with a day-and-date streaming release and is the one non-live event premier in Peacock's history.
We're also looking forward to extending our streaming platforms outside of the U.S. with Peacock launching on Sky next month and SkyShowtime
in the works for mid-2022. At Sky, I want to re-emphasize how well we're performing in the U.K., which continues its growth trajectory in customer
relationships led by record low churn.
We're also seeing great momentum in our broadband and mobile businesses. Earlier this month, Dana Strong and her team introduced Sky Glass
in London, a premium all-in-one streaming television and multichannel subscription package that is so much more than just a stunning TV with
amazing sound. It's an innovation platform that opens up a whole new world of entertainment for our customers and simplifies the experience so
they can stream every channel, every show and every app in one easy-to-use interface. And already, the customer response has very much exceeded
our initial expectations.
We're also incredibly proud that Sky Glass is the first TV to be certified carbon neutral. Sky has been leading all of Comcast with its sustainability
goals and is the first media company in the U.K. to commit to being net carbon zero by 2030.
While Glass and XClass are distinct products with different monetization and distribution strategies, they extend our customer base beyond our
previous capabilities. And they run off the same global technology platform. This allows us to quickly bring the best features to consumers across
territories, segments and brands and on Comcast hardware and through our syndication partners.
I'm pleased to also announce today that Apple will bring Apple TV+ and the Apple TV app to our Xfinity and Sky customers on X1, Flex, XClass, Sky
Glass and Sky Q devices. And Comcast is bringing the Xfinity Stream and Sky Go apps to Apple TV devices. We're working together with our partners
to deliver the best apps and experiences on our platforms. And our teams are sharing capabilities and collaborating across the company, collectively
drawing on our scale and leadership in broadband, aggregation and streaming to innovate and profitably serve new and existing customers.
Looking ahead, I am excited about the opportunities we have to both invest in our business and return capital through buybacks and dividends
all while maintaining leverage around current levels. And I believe we are extremely well-positioned to continue our track record of building
long-term shareholder value.
So I'm pleased to now hand it over to Mike for more detail on this strong quarter.
Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corporation - CFO
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 4 with our third quarter consolidated 2021 results. Revenue increased 19% to $30.3
billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $9 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.87 per share. And finally, we generated $3.2 billion of free
cash flow.
Now let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable revenue increased 7.4% to $16.1 billion.
EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, and net cash flow grew 16% to $5 billion.
As a reminder, comparisons to last year were impacted by adjustments accrued for customer RSN fees. Excluding these adjustments, Cable
Communications revenue increased 6.3% with no corresponding impact to EBITDA.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
We added 255,000 net new customer relationships in the quarter once again driven by broadband, where we added 300,000 net new residential
and business customers. We continue to benefit from high levels of customer retention with broadband churn improving to the lowest rate for
any third quarter on record.
The strong level of net customer additions over the past year, including this third quarter, coupled with higher average revenue per customer,
drove broadband revenue growth of 12%. This growth was about 1 point lower, excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's results.
Wireless and business services also drove our strong Cable revenue growth. Wireless revenue grew 51% driven by growth in customer lines and
higher device sales. Overall, we added 285,000 lines in the quarter, the best result since launching this business in 2017, bringing total mobile lines
to 3.7 million.
Business services revenue increased 8.7%, reflecting an increase in rates and customers primarily driven by the continued improvement in small
businesses. We added 18,000 net new customers in the quarter and 72,000 over the past year. We recently closed on our acquisition of Masergy,
which enables us to offer a broader range of products and solutions to mid-market and enterprise customers and expands our market opportunity
to customers with a global presence.
Moving to video. Revenue increased 1.4% and was flat excluding the RSN fee adjustments in last year's third quarter driven by a residential rate
increase at the beginning of the year, mostly offset by video subscriber net losses totaling 408,000 this quarter.
Last, advertising revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting a strong overall market recovery compared to last year's third quarter, which was impacted by
COVID, partially offset by lower political advertising. As a reminder, the fourth quarter year-over-year comparison will be impacted by record levels
of political advertising last year.
Turning to expenses. Cable Communications third quarter expenses increased 5.3%. Programming expenses increased 7.6% mainly reflecting the
comparison to last year, which benefited from RSN adjustments. Excluding these, programming expenses were up 2.8% as we begin to lap the
large number of contract renewals that started to cycle through in 2020.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 3.9% and decreased 0.8% on a per relationship basis, reflecting our investment to drive growth in our core
businesses, broadband, wireless and business services. This resulted in higher technical and product support and advertising, marketing and
promotion expenses, which were partially offset by lower bad debt and customer service expense.
Cable Communications EBITDA increased 10% to $7.1 billion, including a contribution of $51 million from our wireless business. Cable EBITDA
margin reached 43.9%, reflecting 120 basis points of year-over-year improvement.
While the RSN fee adjustments had no impact on EBITDA, they did impact margins last year. Excluding the RSN adjustment impact, our margin
expanded 160 basis points year-over-year. Cable capital expenditures decreased 5.4%, resulting in CapEx intensity of 10.4%. But there is typically
some choppiness in Cable CapEx from quarter-to-quarter mainly due to timing.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, revenue increased 58% to $10 billion, and EBITDA increased
48% to $1.35 billion. Media revenue increased 48% to $6.8 billion, including $1.8 billion associated with the Tokyo Olympics. Excluding the Olympics,
revenue increased 9.2% driven by higher distribution and advertising revenue.
Distribution revenue increased over 12%, reflecting higher rates post the successful completion of several carriage renewals at the end of 2020
and a growing contribution from Peacock, partially offset by subscriber declines, which have been stable for the past few quarters. Advertising
revenue increased 7.2%, reflecting an overall market recovery compared to last year, very strong demand and pricing for our ad inventory, a higher
contribution from Peacock and a solid start to the new fall season, including strong NFL ratings, partially offset by the timing of sporting events
compared to last year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
Media EBITDA increased 1.2% to $997 million, including results of Tokyo Olympics, the favorable comparison on the timing of other sporting events
and Peacock losses that were impacted by higher costs associated with the day-and-date release of The Boss Baby: Family Business. As a reminder,
our fourth quarter results will face a difficult comparison to last year due to higher costs associated with the timing of more sporting events at our
regional sports network, an increase in our original entertainment as we continue to launch our fall season and the inclusion of our latest studio
release Halloween Kills on Peacock.
Studios revenue increased 27% driven fairly equally by growth in theatrical and content licensing revenue. The increase in theatrical revenue
reflected the continued success of F9 as well as several new releases, including The Boss Baby: Family Business, which was in theaters and on
Peacock. In addition, content licensing revenue growth benefited from the delivery of content to our networks, Peacock and third parties. Studio
EBITDA declined 47% to $179 million, driven by higher amortization of television and film production costs as we return to pre-COVID levels of
production and investment in marketing and promotion to launch our new films.
Looking to the fourth quarter. EBITDA comparisons to last year will remain challenging in the short term as we launch new theatrical releases and
ramp our TV productions, which had been impacted by the pandemic. Moving to Theme Parks. Revenue increased by $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.
And we generated EBITDA of $434 million, which included about $130 million of Universal Beijing pre-opening costs. This was our most profitable
quarter since the pandemic began in the first quarter of 2020 driven by improved operating results at our U.S. parks, including strong domestic
attendance and per caps that were above pre-pandemic levels.
In fact, as Brian noted, Universal Orlando delivered its highest EBITDA for any quarter in its history. At Universal Studios Japan, results were challenging
as we continue to operate under government capacity restrictions, keeping attendance below 2019 levels. Last, we opened Universal Beijing on
September 20th, where the initial demand has been positive. While our parks offer a great experience year round, we expect some seasonality
given Beijing's weather conditions with lower attendance in the fall and winter and more in spring and summer. So overall, on parks, we are
encouraged by the continued recovery, but getting back to and then exceeding pre-pandemic levels of EBITDA will likely require an improvement
in international visitation.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 for Sky, which I'll speak to on a constant currency basis. For the third quarter, Sky revenue was $5 billion and relatively
consistent compared to last year. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent with last year's results, primarily reflecting strong growth in the
U.K. driven by continued growth in customer relationships and higher ARPU due to the positive impact of a rate increase earlier this year, higher
mobile device sales and the continued turnaround in hospitality revenue as pubs and clubs come back. This was offset by a decrease in customer
relationships and ARPU in Italy, mainly due to a negative impact from the reduction in broadcast rights to Serie A.
Sky's overall customer relationships declined 233,000 entirely driven by customer losses in Italy. Advertising revenue increased 16% with the results
in the U.K. driving the bulk of the growth and reflecting the overall market recovery from COVID-19. This increase was offset by a 26% decline in
content revenue driven by the change in sports licensing agreements in Italy and Germany as well as the timing of sports events compared to last
year when several events had shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to COVID-19.
Turning to our EBITDA results. During the quarter, there was a change in the way we amortize sports rights. This cost is now aligned more directly
to when games are played, including when seasons begin and end. This resulted in a $130 million benefit in the third quarter, which will reverse
in the fourth quarter. Going forward, this change will continue to impact the quarterly pattern of recognizing sports rights amortization costs, with
expense higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters, but it should not impact our full year results. Overall,
Sky's EBITDA increased 76%, reflecting this benefit as well as lower sports programming costs due to resets in our sports rights and the favorable
comparison on the timing of sporting events.
Before I comment on capital returns and balance sheet, let me make a comment on our Corporate and Other segment. As we've done in the past
with other start-up activities, launch costs related to Sky Glass and XClass will be reported in our Corporate segment, which could become more
meaningful beginning with this fourth quarter.
Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 8. We generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow this quarter, including a $670
million benefit related to the tax impact of the bond exchange we completed in August. Consolidated total capital was $2.9 billion for the quarter.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
And as expected, net working capital increased, reflecting our broadcast of the Olympics as well as the continued post-COVID ramp of investment
in studio content. Return of capital totaled $2.7 billion, including $1.2 billion of dividend payments and $1.5 billion of share repurchase activity.
Our net leverage at quarter end was 2.4x, which means we are now back at a level that is consistent with our existing ratings and reflects substantial
progress in both debt reduction and a strong rebound in our businesses post the pandemic. From here, my expectation is that we keep our leverage
ratio around where we currently are and continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which consists of maintaining a strong balance
sheet, investing organically for profitable growth and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, our buyback will be a function of that
balance and excess free cash flow available for capital returns.
With that, I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.
Marci Ryvicker - Comcast Corporation - SVP of IR
Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's open up the call for questions, please.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
Maybe, Brian, starting with you. The Sky Glass, the move towards the Smart TV seems like a really interesting evolution of your product set, taking
the business beyond your footprint, as you noted, in multiple markets. Can you just talk about some of the long-term vision of what that turns into
for the company? Because it seems like it's a pretty significant opportunity as you've been limited essentially geographically in the past.
And then, I guess, I have to come back, Mike, to your last comment there about leverage, just doing some quick math. I mean, you guys are run
rating I guess, what, $5 billion of buybacks a year, looking at the second half. You've got a $4 billion or so dividend. You generate a lot more free
cash flow than those 2 numbers. So to stay levered here, there's a lot of excess cash flow, which is obviously a nice problem to have. Anything else
you would add in terms of how you stay at 2.5x, just given the strong free cash flow dynamics of the business, would be greatly appreciated.
Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Ben. Let me start that if you look at where we are today, we -- the global technology platform, we do about 5 billion entertainment
streams a week on 75 million devices. So we have a huge global scale. And one of the great things that we've been working on with Dana and Dave
is having a global technology platform and working together on product innovation. So to specifically talk about the connected TV, streaming TV,
which is what Sky Glass and XClass are really all about, I think it's a natural evolution. So I think it's a beginning of a logical extension.
And so I was in London for the launch of Sky Glass, and we've been working on it since the day we bought Sky, taken about 3 years to see it come
to fruition. It's a really exciting product, just simplifies for the consumer so much. Dana can talk in a moment a little bit about it. It is a really
breakthrough idea, I think, on how people buy it and pay for it.
But mostly, it's an embodiment of what we do well, which is aggregation, and that we're going to find a way for consumers to get to what they
want faster, personalize it and have fun along the way. And then it's a platform for innovation on a go-forward basis for where we think television
may evolve. And whether it's gaming, whether it's fitness, health care, education. And so having that be a part of your relationship with our company,

I think, is novel territory for us to do R&D off of in the U.S. And finally, it allows us to take it all over Europe potentially, as you say, in and out of
footprint.
So we're starting in the U.K., but we have ambitions to expand quickly to other countries. And it's great for streamers and streaming services. So
our importance to the streaming universe will continue to grow. And our relationship and certainly the Apple announcement today is the latest
iteration of that. In the U.S., pretty much locked in sync with our Sky team is the XClass, and Dave can talk a little bit about that. But we look at the
markets, there's different opportunities, different realities with our partnership with Hisense and with Walmart, where many Americans get their
televisions.
And so we're excited to begin. And I think -- so different ends of the market perhaps. We'll look at this as learnings across the globe. And it follows
right on the heels of X1, Q, Flex and the progress we've made on innovation. So I'm really excited by it, and I think it also shows the one company
working well together. Let me start with Dana. Why don't you add a few thoughts on Sky Glass? And then, Dave, over to you, and then we'll get to
the question on leverage with Mike.
Dana Strong - Comcast Corporation - Group CEO of Sky
Thanks so much, Brian. I appreciate it. Sky Glass is our latest innovation for new streaming TV. And as it was touched on, this eliminates the need
for a dish and a set-top box, which is really, really important in the go-forward. And we believe it's the smartest TV in the market.
I can say based on our experience of product launches, the consumer reaction here has been fantastic. And I think that really starts with the product
itself, which is quite innovative. We've changed the commercial model of the product to follow the approach of the mobile handset sales. So we've
converted a large upfront payment to an affordable monthly payment with ownership, of course.
It establishes a long-term relationship with the customer, as a result. And it really improves -- the product really improves our acquisition economics
because it allows for self-installation, and there's no longer a need for a dish and a set-top box.
I think another big part of the product innovation has been reducing the complexity of the purchase decision itself. So everything is inside, all of
the highest specs. And the customer really only needs to choose the size, inclusive of the audio, which is truly fantastic all built in.
And then the breakthrough in the experience, and that's where Sky really does shine is in the fully integrated product. So that interplay between
linear, on-demand and app content, which can really enhance people's time spent viewing. So you're no longer coming in and out of apps, but
the content is lifted up and able to toggle across content more easily, this is what kind of makes the product such a standout and I think is driving
some of the consumer reaction that we've seen.
As Brian touched on, we think Sky Glass gives us some interesting headroom. It opens up customers we haven't been able to reach before if they've
been prohibited from having satellite dishes or didn't want them. It opens up customers who are more interested in streaming content. It opens
up syndication opportunities for us.
And importantly, as Brian touched on, it opens up a lot of opportunity for both stickiness and potentially, new revenue areas when we think about
things like watch together or fitness and health long, long term. We think that this is a platform for innovation and really, really just the beginning.
And I think the compelling part about this is that all of the guts of this are exactly the same as all of the Comcast technology. So this is all built
through the collaboration and enablement of Comcast. And so the synergies between this and some of the smart TV developments in the U.S. are
huge synergies where the hardware, the software, the cloud services are almost entirely the same.

David N. Watson - Comcast Corporation - President & CEO of Comcast Cable
This is Dave, Ben. So -- and I think Dana hit it, Brian hit it. It really is for XClass, we're not starting from scratch because of this constant focus around
innovation and working with the Sky team, working together the Cable group. So we're excited about XClass. It's early days.
But it is -- clearly, the smart TV is a really important device to get to. So we're able to take our software stack, working across the board and focus
on the right segment that wants very little friction. It just wants the smart TV to work, and we're able to do 2 things: one, deliver the world-class UI.
So great voice, great data integration, able to add things like the Charter app, our app on top of it. So we can -- there's a lot of flexibility that we
have and the business model that we have. We can go to market with the TV manufacturers, the retailers in mind and pull it all together in a unique
way because we're coming in a little bit later.
So it's a great product. We're very excited about it, within our footprint, outside. And we're able to position Peacock as a key part of the offering in
a great way and within the UI. And so overall, very excited, early, but this is clearly a focus of ours.
Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corporation - CFO
So Ben, it's Mike. So on capital allocation and leverage, so just to recap things, we ended at 2.4x leverage. So like I said earlier, I think we intend to
stay around this level from here. So plus or minus, a tick or so because we're not trying to stick the landing each and every quarter on a specific
number by any stretch.
But that's right. I think the -- we've said all along that our businesses are healthy, as you're going to hear from all the operating executives here.
They're all going to grow free cash flow over the long term. And that does create a big long-term picture for us that will put us in a great position
to continue to maintain the strong balance sheet we have, continue to invest organically in the businesses and then return ample capital back to
shareholders. And the performance of the business and the patterning of those investments are what will dictate the outcome. But it's -- we feel
very good about being back at this place where that's what the picture looks like.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse.
Douglas David Mitchelson - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD
So I guess that leaves broadband for me. And so I think, Dave, in particular, Brian, I'm not sure if you have thoughts as well, there's just a lot of
concerns in the marketplace by investors on fiber build-outs in fixed wireless. And then, of course, 3Q came in below 3Q '19.
And I think, Dave, a couple of questions. One is, what's the right baseline for growth in broadband net additions that investors should think about?
I think during the pandemic, as we moved through a lot of us look at 2019 as a normal year pre-pandemic. It was a good year for you and the
industry for broadband growth. So one, when you look forward, like what's the right baseline for growth that you measure your businesses on?
And then secondarily, any thoughts on how momentum looks in 4Q and how you feel about competitive threats would be helpful.
David N. Watson - Comcast Corporation - President & CEO of Comcast Cable
You got it, Doug. So first off, as you said, we're still clearly in a fluid environment. To be clear though, the fundamentals of the business are very
strong, and there's a really long runway of growth in broadband. So we haven't changed our feeling on that at all.
We have a terrific network. It's scaled, it's ubiquitous, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. And we're in a good position for the future.
So we haven't changed our view on the long-term trajectory of the connectivity business. I'm just as confident and optimistic in the prospects for
this business as I've ever been.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
So when you look at the whole year, I think it underscores the strength of broadband. Year-to-date, we've added over 1.1 million net additions,
and we've been adding over 1 million broadband subscribers each year for the past 20 years.
And as you said, while the pace in Q3 was slower than we saw earlier in the year during the height of the pandemic, our broadband net adds are
still very healthy, and our churn remains at record lows, certainly for a Q3. I think it's important to look at the current environment. And I think that
points a little bit, Doug, to what you're talking about.
And kind of just a couple of drivers to call out. One, when you look at the slowdown and Mike talked about this earlier, there have been a slowdown
in connects across our footprint. And we look very closely at the move activity. There's more activity earlier in the year around moves, slower now.
And certainly, the last couple of months below 2019 levels, in terms of moves. So a little bit less college student activity, not alarmingly so, but just
a little bit less and just a little bit less switching activity overall.
I think if you look at other operators, everyone's churn is down. So that means just some less jump balls where we do well. I think the other thing
to call out in terms of drivers, we're seeing less growth from the lower income segment. We're still adding customers in this segment, but not at
the same rate as earlier. There are new government programs like EBB. We're seeing traditional wireless, not fixed wireless, but traditional wireless
participate, and be very active in this program.
And last point on competition. Look, we take it all very seriously. And we've been in a very competitive situation for some time. Our focus has not
wavered. We innovate. We deliver the best product for each segment. We break the market down in terms of segments, and we compete at a very
local level. We have our granular view literally at the block level geographically and by each segment from HSD-only to multiple product households.
So you add it all up, our churn remains at record lows, whether it's fiber, whether -- or not. And we look at our competitors' performance overall to
ours historically and now, and I think this says it all.
So as for expectations for full year results, while current visibility and overall activity creates a little bit of modest risk, we still believe full year net
adds will be around 2019 levels. So overall, when you look at this year, and you go back to 2019, 2019 was the second best year that we've had in
well over a decade. It's just a terrific year. And so for us to be at that level and the consistency that we've had has been so strong, and you point to
the fundamentals.
There are some things that we're on, but like always, you attack them, and you break them down. But I really like the fundamentals and the
momentum that we have. So I think the runway is absolutely still there. And the last point is business services, a very important part of the connectivity
story. And there, I love their momentum as well. So you add it all up, I like where we're at with connectivity.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.
Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP - US Team Head of Communications Services
Dave, I'm wondering if I can follow up on that last question. The -- if the full year is around 2019 levels, it suggests that 4Q is a bit below where you
were in 2019. Is it your sense that we sort of pulled growth from the fourth quarter into the -- earlier into the year and 2022 will be sort of back to
that normal trend? Or do you think the slowdown that we're seeing in 4Q might continue into 2022?
And I recognize that it's difficult to have visibility given all of the sort of the puts and takes coming out of the pandemic. But any color around the
progression of the trend would be, I think, would be really helpful to investors.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
David N. Watson - Comcast Corporation - President & CEO of Comcast Cable
Understood. As I mentioned around the visibility, so I wouldn't comment yet at this point on '22 other to say what I've already said around '19 being
very strong and point back towards the fundamentals in terms of the trending around churn, the activity that we have. And so I think more to come
later, but I think there's -- we have this consistent momentum.
If you -- going back -- pointing back to over 1 million broadband net adds over a 20-year period just -- it speaks to the strength of the category. So
overall views, long runway for growth, where we're at with penetration. We haven't changed our longer-term view of that.
Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP - US Team Head of Communications Services
And just following on from that. It's presumably the low churn that you're seeing is feeding into the tremendous EBITDA growth that you're seeing
in the Cable segment as well. If churn has to -- if churn for the industry has to recover for growth in broadband to recover, would that -- is there
sort of an offset to growth in EBITDA than as we think -- as we look ahead as well?
David N. Watson - Comcast Corporation - President & CEO of Comcast Cable
I think the main point churn is already did a very good place. I think they're overall at record lows. So I think what we're dealing with is transactional
activity, it's a little bit lighter on the connect side. So we're already in a good position. I think we have a balanced approach towards ARPU growth.
We have a balanced approach towards customer share growth. So those fundamentals, I think, are consistent.
Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corporation - Chairman & CEO
That's the one point. I just -- this is Brian. I just want to add to Dave. I think, gave a very comprehensive and totally agree with the 2 questions that
got asked, his answer. I think that, that last point I just want to underscore, which is we're -- the record low churn suggests, to me anyway, a very
stable business. That's what's so great about the 32 million broadband customers that we have. We have a recurring business. So while maybe
there was a pull forward, maybe there's a slowdown, time will tell as your question suggests.
We're looking at how do we grow EBITDA, how do we grow margins, how do we maintain and offer more product connectivity, kind of the very
first thing we talked about, what else can you do with broadband, what will broadband evolve to over the next 5, 10 years. So we're super focused
on minute to minute, but we're also, I think Dave put in context just how good we feel and it's certainly business services, the same kind of innovation
that we've been doing in residential we're doing in business services.
And so it's not some change in market conditions that really we've all been reading about. While there may be coming and maybe there's some
of that, I actually think it's personally the disruption from the pandemic, coupled with a large percentage of Americans have broadband. So the
question for us going forward is how do we continue to grow the value of that broadband and obviously, therefore, grow the value to our
shareholders.
Operator
Our next question is from Jessica Reif from BoA Securities.
Jessica Jean Reif Ehrlich - BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in Equity Research
I guess a bigger picture question and then it's something really short. You look out towards next year, I mean, NBCU will clearly have a record year
with the Olympics, Super Bowl, record upfront. Political looks like there's a lot of money being raised. Hopefully, we'll see a return of international
theme park visitors, and movies seem to be stabilizing.

OCTOBER 28, 2021 / 12:30PM, CMCSA.OQ - Q3 2021 Comcast Corp Earnings Call
Sky, obviously, you've got this rollout of Sky Glass and Peacock and hopefully benefit from some of the past investments. And Cable, as you guys
have just discussed, you're going out of footprint with XClass TV, which I'd love your comments, but it seems like it would benefit broadband,
Peacock and advertising. Mobile is more aggressive.
So with that long-winded introduction, just could you talk about your priorities for 2022 and beyond? How different will the business look over
the next 3 to 5 years? And then the kind of quick short question is just on Peacock. You didn't mention anything about usage or monthly active
accounts. So if you could give some color there.
Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Let me start. Thanks for -- you're all over the kind of sense of optimism that, at least, I think we all feel for the company, where I think we're one of
the fortunate companies. We -- during the pandemic, we've talked in the past about how well I think we transition to work from home, customer
care, continued productions. So as we come hopefully out of this in the U.S. and globally, where are we driving our company? And I think we
ultimately go where the consumer wants to be. And we have products and different prices that allow customers to come to our company.
We're getting close to nearly 60 million customer relationships, I think, 57 million or 58 million global relationships. And these are $100 a month
plus type relationships. And so we want to be the best leader, and that's why we're continuing the innovation. And then you add in theme parks,
as you talked about, and the big events that people come to our company, whether they're advertisers or business partners.
So I think that's all driven off a global technology platform, and that's where I think we have the real leadership. So -- and then I want to echo what
Mike has said a couple of times. We feel like we're back in balance in our priorities, and that really puts us in a position to go forward to be disciplined
in what we're doing, be a leader. And that's going to produce after all the many years that our company has been building these relationships
around the world to produce a lot of free cash that will be returned to shareholders. But Jeff, why don't you go specifically to the Peacock and other
NBC? We haven't heard from you yet. So maybe talk about the company in general.
Jeffrey S. Shell - Comcast Corporation - CEO of NBCUniversal
Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Jessica. So everything on Peacock is heading in the right direction, and there's really nothing from a trajectory
perspective that's any different than it was last quarter or the quarter before. All metrics are pointed up. Our usage continues to be great. Our mix
of users continues to be great. We added a few million more subs, more MAAs, everything. Advertising, we -- in this quarter, we just at the tail end
of the quarter, we started selling advertising beyond sponsorship of which in the fourth quarter, it's all beyond sponsorship. And that is going
spectacularly well. So we're really pleased with Peacock. It's way ahead of where we expected to be at this point. And every month, every quarter,
it gets further ahead. And as you were talking about the business overall for next year, I was getting excited because we're very excited about next
year with everything that we've got coming across NBCUniversal from the Olympics to the Super Bowl to a spectacular movie slate to a very strong
advertising business, ratings, our linear networks improving.
And I think Peacock -- I would add to that, that Peacock is doing really well right now without most of its programming strength. So if you look at
the future, and you look at where we're headed with Peacock, we have -- because of the pandemic, we were behind on our original production.
So we're going to start to see a ramp-up in originals on Peacock, which is very necessary to continue to grow to have successful and robust original
programming. And we're excited about a lot of the things that we're making for the service.
We decided to buy our first window as we talked about last call of our movies. So our Pay-One rights, so to speak. And the first movie in our Pay-One
rights will hit Peacock in the first quarter, and then we'll have a steady supply of movies. We've seen across all streaming platforms that movies
move the dial. They moved the dial for Peacock in this quarter with Boss Baby, recently with Halloween Kills, which, by the way, was a huge hit on
the Peacock and a huge hit at the box office. So it shows that you can kind of play in 2 different markets.
So we have all of our movies coming to Peacock, and we couldn't be more excited about where Peacock is. And we'll continue to invest behind
that success. I think it's important to remember, too, that we launched just over a year ago. We launched in July of last year. So we've been a business

about the year overall in the company and really excited about where Peacock is going.

Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.
Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC - Co-Founder, Founding Partner
So I guess, having talked about broadband and some of the growth initiatives across the company, let's talk about wireless as the other big growth
initiative. I guess, first, the way I would question sort of we've seen some data that suggests that your WiFi is offloading a lot more traffic than we
would have expected from the contract. So that the gross margins of that business may be much more -- much higher than we had previously
believed.
It makes me wonder, what's the strategic goal for that business? Is it really to drive the business into being the largest, most profitable business it
can be? Or is it still largely to reduce churn on broadband and think of it as more of a defensive product for protecting your existing business?
And then if I could just squeeze in a second unrelated question. Can you just update us on your thoughts of Hulu, which, I guess, doesn't necessarily
come up until 2024? But is there any opportunity that you might do something with Hulu sooner?
David N. Watson - Comcast Corporation - President & CEO of Comcast Cable
Hey, Craig, Dave here. So let me start with wireless. So I don't think -- we really haven't changed our strategic imperative behind mobile. But most
certainly, things have accelerated and that we are very focused on how we leverage mobile to support broadband.
Once we were successfully worked on the Verizon relationship and improved the MVNO relationship, we're able to go to market with and launching
the new unlimited plans, combining that with By the Gig, just puts us in a unique position. So I think our goal is what we said earlier is to go faster
and leverage mobile completely and everything that we do and how we surround broadband with a terrific product. I think it is profitable. It'll
continue to be. I feel confident of that.
But the main focus is to drive broadband. And there are a couple of key things. One, it is -- it continues to support the broadband churn and pointing
towards record low broadband overall churns. Mobile is just one piece of that. But it also drives consideration on the front end. So when things --
some -- the activity overall begins to tick back up, I think retail and mobile play a huge role. As you pointed out, I think the other key point is how
do we leverage product integration with WiFi. We already do a great job, thus the -- every mobile device we contribute just a ton of broadband
traffic through these mobile devices over our WiFi network, and it's part of our network.
So over time, we want to work hard on how do we integrate the experience and just do more so I think in the home and we'll be opportunistic
outside the home. So I think it's -- we're accelerating mobile [in] every single sales channel, every marketing plan. And we'll continue to package
mobile with broadband in unique ways going forward.
Michael J. Cavanagh - Comcast Corporation - CFO
Craig, it's Mike. So on Hulu, just tremendous increase in value there. Obviously, great business that's participating in one of the hottest areas of
value, increased streaming. So we're happy to be along for that ride, obviously, while we set up our own thing in Peacock. In terms of the deal, it
is a couple of years out. But remember, we kind of put this together a couple of years ago. And I'm certainly glad we didn't exit at the time 3 or so
years ago. So like the deal we have, and I think we're always open for business. But it will be fine if we stay to the end because I expect value to
keep increasing.

Operator
Our last question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst
I want to ask a couple of follow-ups. First on the broadband trends. The last few quarters and in September, you've been pretty specific about how
you thought the year would come in. Is there just less visibility today compared to where we were in September? And it sounds like this isn't a
competition issue, just more of an underlying demand. How also does that make you think about price increases this year for broadband and video,
with the pandemic still going on and the new FCC?
And as well on the buyback. In the last cycle, you weren't really willing to borrow money to buy back stock, preferring to use cash flow and let
leverage drift lower. It sounds like it's different this time. And is that driven by the stock price being really attractive where you really want to just
keep that leverage in that sort of mid-2-ish range?
David N. Watson - Comcast Corporation - President & CEO of Comcast Cable
Well, Phil, let me start. It's Dave. Let me start with the broadband. So as I said, there is some limited visibility on what we've seen and obviously, an
acceleration of activity earlier in the year that was more like '20, in the first part of '21. But primarily really on the connect side, and I think I walked
through some of the drivers behind that. But again, pointing towards the whole year gives perspective on Q4 around the 2019 levels. Still I think
the key is the overall churn level is just being where they're at, and I've talked about that.
Your point, our approach is to consistently focus on value and whether it's fiber or not. Our goal is constantly innovate, position the greatest
network, I think, for today and tomorrow. And we're constantly adding speeds. We've improved coverage, great devices, the gateways, the pods,
control improvements that we've had, streaming with the Flex, now XClass and mobile. We're surrounding broadband with products that eases
some of the pressure around pricing when you can package with so many alternatives.
The other thing that we do is we provide multiple tiers of broadband. And we market -- we break down the broadband marketplace into segments.
So we have a lot of choice out there. And so it is -- we go, and we consult with the prospects upfront and customers all the time what's best for
them. And we put them in packages that work and that gives an opportunity to drive ARPU when you do it that way. So overall, the fundamentals,
again, I talked about. And you look at the long-term runway of broadband and the consistency of how we performed. And to me, that's -- I think,
points towards the future. So Brian?
Brian L. Roberts - Comcast Corporation - Chairman & CEO
Okay. Well, I think it's a perfect way to end the call, Phil, with your question. Let me again state that I think it was a great quarter. And one of the
highlights of the quarter was returning after several years to what we have, our target leverage ratio, which Mike talked about.
And so we sort of separate, at least I do in my mind, the borrowing from the buybacks. They're not linked the way you described. It may appear
that way. And I just want to give a compliment to our treasury team, Jason Armstrong and the team. During the last 18 months, our balance sheet
has now never been in a stronger position.
We've done some long-term rollovers and extensions at historically low rates. And so you put all that together with this operating performance,
and it does get us back to where we wanted to be, which will then allow us to more aggressively take advantage of what a number of us believe
is a great company. And therefore, you can put your own value on it as shareholders.

external investments. Todd will walk us through our 2022 financial guidance. But first, I'd like to begin by reflecting 
on another exceptional year for Seagen. We achieved important milestones in 2021 and continued to expand our 
global infrastructure and portfolio.
I'll begin with our commercial products. ADCETRIS is a US standard of care in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and 
peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and forms the foundation of our core business from a revenue standpoint. 
ADCETRIS has received approval in more than 75 countries, and we and our partner, Takeda, continue to 
provide this important drug to patients in need.
Notably, last week we announced that the phase 3 ECHELON-1 clinical trial demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in overall survival in advanced Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with ADCETRIS plus 
chemotherapy in the frontline setting.
Over 30 years ago, ABVD was established as standard of care for treating Hodgkin's disease, and almost 15 
years ago, data regarding intensified BEACOPP was initially released. We are thrilled that ADCETRIS plus AVD 
has now improved overall survival, and we believe these groundbreaking data further demonstrate ADCETRIS' 
clinical value and importance in this disease.
PADCEV is a first-in-class ADC, which has become a standard of care in the US for previously treated metastatic 
urothelial cancer. PADCEV has been broadly adopted by US oncologists to treat more than 6,500 patients todate. Last year, PADCEV received regular US approval and was also granted a cisplatin-ineligible second-line 
indication. Together with our partner Astellas, in 2021 we secured approvals in Canada, Switzerland, Israel and 
Japan. We are progressing regulatory submissions across Asia Pacific and the Americas.
PADCEV received a positive CHMP opinion in December 2021. Recently, the European Commission decisionmaking process was paused for additional CHMP questions related to severe skin reactions in a French 
compassionate access program. This side effect is described in USPI and since launch has been well managed 
by US prescribing physicians. We believe that the risk-benefit profile of PADCEV remains unchanged. We are 
committed to working with European authorities to get this important drug approved for urothelial cancer patients.
Beyond these global regulatory activities, we are advancing a robust clinical development program with PADCEV 
as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy. We completed enrollment of EV103 Cohort K and expect data in the second half of this year, which could potentially support accelerated approval 
in the US in 2023 for first-line metastatic urothelial cancer. We are also exploring earlier stages of bladder cancer, 
which represent larger market opportunities. In muscle invasive bladder cancer, we will report neoadjuvant 
monotherapy data at ASCO GU later this month and we are now enrolling patients in a trial for non-muscle 
invasive bladder cancer. Finally, we are conducting a basket trial evaluating PADCEV in other Nectin-4 
expressing solid tumors.
TUKYSA is a best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with broad potential in HER2 cancers. Overall survival 
data and inclusion in key treatment guidelines reflects its clinical value in second- and later-line HER2-positive 
breast cancer patients with and without brain metastases. TUKYSA is approved in 36 countries, and we have 
commercially launched in the US, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Austria. We are working to secure 
reimbursement and are planning launches in additional European countries over the course of 2022. We recently 
announced the appointment of Lee Heeson, as Executive Vice President, Commercial International. We look 
forward to Lee's contributions towards our continued ex-US expansion.

Our strategic partnership with Merck extends TUKYSA's reach outside of the US, Europe and Canada. TUKYSA's 
broad clinical development program includes HER2-positive breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and 
other HER2-amplified or mutant tumors. Notably, we expect data from the phase 2 MOUNTAINEER trial in the 
second half of this year, which could potentially support accelerated FDA approval in colorectal cancer in 2023.
Seagen's fourth approved product is TIVDAK, which we launched in collaboration with Genmab. TIVDAK, which is 
a tissue factor-targeted ADC was approved for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer patients with disease 
progression on or after chemotherapy. It represents an important new drug in a disease that is characterized by 
low objective response rates and poor outcomes. TIVDAK's clinical development program is designed to support 
global regulatory applications and maximize its future potential in cervical cancer and other solid tumors. As we 
look to expand TIVDAK in cervical cancer, we recently presented promising combination data in earlier lines of 
treatment, which could lead to use in much larger patient populations.
In 2021, we also drove key advancements across our deep and diverse pipeline. For example, we in-licensed the 
late-stage novel ADC, disitamab vedotin, which utilizes a high-affinity HER2 antibody with enhanced 
internalization compared to trastuzumab. DV received conditional approval in China for third-line gastric cancer 
and recently in second and later lines of metastatic urothelial cancer. Our clinical development program prioritizes 
monotherapy and combination approaches in breast, bladder, gastric and other cancers. DV utilizes our vedotinbased ADC technology, and leveraging our expertise, we are working to maximize this development, potential 
value, and global reach.
Turning to our earlier stage work. We recently initiated two trials for two novel ADCs, SGN-PDL1V and SGNB7H4V, and we have also submitted an IND, which just cleared for and SGN-ALPV. We are developing new ADC 
technologies in order to widen the therapeutic window of this exciting class of drug with a focus on improving 
tolerability.
In addition, we have four programs that use our proprietary sugar engineered antibody technology. Overall, we 
are advancing more than 17 programs across our pipeline and approved products in a range of solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies.
Next, I want to provide a brief update on the Daiichi Sankyo litigation. Recently, the arbitration hearing record was 
reopened by the arbitrator to consider additional evidence. As a result, the decision may occur after the first 
quarter of 2022, as previously anticipated.
Our 2021 achievements have helped to bolster our resilient core business and the solid foundation we continue to 
build upon. We expect to achieve many milestones in 2022, including important clinical data readouts, global 
regulatory and commercial progress and advances across our pipeline, which will help drive future growth.
As we look to deliver continued innovation and develop transformative therapies, we remain focused on three key 
areas. First, we are working to maximize the potential of our approved portfolio through exceptional commercial 
execution, clinical development and strategic partnerships. We've expanded our commercial portfolio from one to 
four products in under two years and have treated over 110,000 patients to-date. Robust clinical development 
programs will generate the potential for future label expansions and opportunities.
Second, we are advancing our deep and diverse pipeline of assets as we look to bring drugs five, six and seven 
to market in the coming years. We believe our ADC leadership and R&D expertise in empowered antibodies 
provides us with a competitive advantage when it comes to expanding and progressing our pipeline.

Finally, we are well-positioned for continued innovation and growth, having built and optimized our infrastructure 
and capabilities. Our expanding geographic footprint and over 50 strategic partnerships maximize our ability to 
reach patients across the globe.
Our strong corporate development team and significant financial strength allows us to execute upon deals that will 
further accelerate our trajectory.
Next, I'll turn the call over to Chip, who will provide an update on our commercial performance. Then Todd will 
discuss our financial results and 2022 guidance. After that, Roger will detail our clinical development activities and 
pipeline. Chip?

Charles Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seagen Inc.
Thanks, Clay.
The commercial team delivered another strong quarter to close out a very successful year for Seagen. We've 
effectively scaled and executed in our efforts to maximize the potential of our commercial portfolio of four 
products. ADCETRIS fourth quarter 2021 sales were $176 million, an 8% increase over the fourth quarter of 
2020. Our focus remains on driving share in frontline stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma.
We were pleased to see the recent update to the NCCN treatment guidelines that recognize the significance of 
the five-year ECHELON-1 data. We are excited to now have overall survival data from the ECHELON-1 phase 3 
study, and we will continue to monitor uptake in the frontline setting.
Moving on to PADCEV. Fourth quarter 2021 US sales were $93 million, a 34% increase over the fourth quarter of 
2020. We have now seen broad adoption of checkpoint inhibitors as maintenance therapy for patients in the 
frontline metastatic setting, which has helped PADCEV become the preferred standard of care in the second-line 
post-maintenance setting.
In addition, the indication for patients who are ineligible for cisplatin containing chemotherapy continues to 
represent a meaningful option and a modest incremental growth opportunity. We expect growth in 2022 to be 
driven by existing indications and look forward to potentially promoting to an additional US PADCEV label in the 
frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting next year.
Moving on to the TUKYSA. Fourth quarter 2021 sales were $94 million, a 53% increase over the fourth quarter of 
last year, with growth coming from both the US and Europe. TUKYSA remains the most utilized product in second 
and later lines in the US in patients with brain mets. Updated overall survival data in these patients that recently 
was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium has been well received and is a promotional focus. 
We are monitoring the evolving HER2 metastatic breast cancer treatment landscape, and we have incorporated 
this into our annual revenue guidance which Todd will detail shortly. TUKYSA sales in Europe for the quarter 
continued to grow, and we look forward to gaining reimbursement in additional countries in 2022.
We are pleased with TIVDAK sales of $6 million for the first full quarter since approval, and launch is going as 
planned. We are navigating the eye care requirements and have gained valuable insights that are allowing us to 
enhance our educational efforts. Although the initial indication represents a modest opportunity, TIVDAK is an 
important treatment option and early feedback has been positive.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd.

Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thanks, Chip, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon.
Our financial results reflect significant advances made across the business in the past year. Today, I'll summarize 
our financial results for 2021 and then discuss our outlook for 2022.
Total revenues were $430 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion dollars for the full year in 2021. This 
included net product sales of $369 million in the fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the full year, representing an 
increase of 38% over the year in 2020. This reflects growth in product sales across our portfolio and particularly 
for TUKYSA and PADCEV.
Royalty revenues were $46 million in the fourth quarter and $151 million for the year in 2021. The 19% year-overyear annual growth in royalty revenues is primarily driven by increasing sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda and, to a 
lesser degree, sales of Polivy by Roche and Blenrep by GSK, both of which are ADCs that utilize Seagen 
technology.
Collaboration revenues were $15 million in the fourth quarter and $38 million for the full year in 2021. 2021 
collaboration revenues decreased as a result of $250 million recognized in the fourth quarter and $975 million 
recognized for the full year in 2020. These amounts related to the ladiratuzumab vedotin and TUKYSA 
collaborations with Merck that we entered into in 2020.
Cost of sales was $87 million in the third quarter and $312 million for the full year in 2021. This included product 
cost of sales and royalties for each of our brands, the gross profit share due to our collaborators, and noncash 
amortization of acquired technology costs for TUKYSA.
R&D expenses were $304 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year in 2021. This is an increase 
over 2020 and included the $200 million up-front payment to RemeGen for in-licensing disitamab vedotin, as well 
as continued investment across our early- and late-stage pipeline.
SG&A expenses were $211 million in the fourth quarter and $716 million for the full year in 2021. These are 
increases over 2020, reflecting investments to support the ongoing launches of TUKYSA across Europe and more 
recently the launch of TIVDAK in the US.
Next, I'll turn to our financial outlook for 2022, beginning with our revenue guidance. Across our three key 
commercial brands, we're guiding to product sales of $1.48 billion to $1.55 billion, representing an increase of 7% 
to 12% over 2021. The ADCETRIS sales are expected to be in the range of $730 million to $755 million, reflecting 
modest growth while we advance a broad clinical development program intended to secure additional labels. 
PADCEV sales are projected to be in the range of $435 million $455 million. We expect growth in 2022 to be 
driven primarily by continued utilization within its two current indications. While we expect to report data from 
Cohort K of the EV-103 trial in the second half of this year, our guidance does not include the impact of a potential 
label expansion.
TUKYSA sales are expected to be in the range of $315 million to $335 million. And as Chip mentioned, our 
guidance reflects the ongoing evolution of the treatment landscape. While we expect to report data from the 
MOUNTAINEER trial later this year in colorectal cancer, we do not anticipate label expansion in 2022. We 
continue to engage with individual country authorities to secure broader European reimbursement, which can take

up to two years post EMA approval. And since we are still early in the launch of TIVDAK, we are not including 
sales estimates in our 2022 guidance at this time.
Next, we expect royalty revenues to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, primarily reflecting sales of 
ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territories, along with contributions from Polivy and Blenrep. Finally, we expect 
collaboration revenues to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million. As a reminder, collaboration revenues 
include our profit share from Astellas' sales of PADCEV in its territory. This now includes royalties from sales in 
Japan and in future years is expected to include a profit share from the EU5.
Now I'll turn to 2022 expense guidance. Cost of sales is expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 
million. This is driven by increased product sales across all brands and the higher profit share payments to our 
collaborators. Cost of sales also reflects third party royalties owed as well as noncash amortization.
R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, primarily related to two items. First, 
investment in clinical trials to further expand ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA and TIVDAK into additional 
indications. And second, increased investment to advance our earlier stage agents, including more than 13 other 
programs in the pipeline. We believe that these investments are important to our long-term growth.
SG&A expenses are expected to be in a range of $780 million to $860 million, as we continue to focus on 
commercial execution to drive growth of our approved products. The guidance also includes investment to 
support the global infrastructure for the continuing launches of TUKYSA in Europe.
Noncash expenses are expected to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million, the majority of which is stockbased compensation.
Taken together, our guidance reflects our strategy to expand the commercial opportunity of our portfolio and to 
advance new product candidates.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger, who will highlight our development activities.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc.
Thank you, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone.
I'm happy to share recent clinical development updates for both our approved medicines and our pipeline. I'll 
begin with ADCETRIS. We are extremely pleased that ADCETRIS in combination with AVD has significantly 
improved overall survival compared with ABVD in newly diagnosed patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. 
ADCETRIS was shown to reduce the risk of death by 41%, with a hazard ratio of 0.59 and p-value of 0.009. 
These data further demonstrate the meaningful difference that ADCETRIS brings to patients, and we look forward 
to presenting the results at an upcoming medical meeting.
In addition, we were recently informed that a phase 3 study of ADCETRIS in newly diagnosed pediatric patients 
with high risk Hodgkin lymphoma, defined as stages IIB with bulk, IIIB and IV has met the primary endpoint of 
event-free survival, as reported by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. Trial AHOD1331 is sponsored by the 
National Cancer Institute and run by the NCI-funded Children's Oncology Group. The study compared an 
ADCETRIS containing chemotherapy regimen to a chemotherapy regimen that included bleomycin. We thank the 
Children's Oncology Group for their efforts, and we look forward to their presentation of these exciting data at an 
upcoming medical meeting.

At ASH, we presented initial data of the combination of ADCETRIS plus nivolumab, Adriamycin and dacarbazine 
in frontline advanced Hodgkin lymphoma, which showed an objective response rate of 93% and the complete 
response rate of 88% at the end of therapy. We believe these promising results could form the basis in the future 
for testing this novel regimen in the frontline setting.
Later this year, we plan to share results describing ADCETRIS' potential utility as an immunomodulator in 
combination with KEYTRUDA in solid tumors. We are also testing ADCETRIS in a phase 2 study in HIV patients, 
which will begin enrolling this quarter.
Turning to PADCEV, we remain focused on moving this important product into earlier lines of urothelial cancer. In 
the frontline metastatic setting, we are evaluating PADCEV and KEYTRUDA in two studies, EV-103 Cohort K in 
patients who are ineligible for cisplatin therapy, and EV-302 which includes both cisplatin-eligible and ineligible 
patients. EV-103 Cohort K has completed enrollment and we expect to report topline results in the second half of 
2022. The phase 3 EV-302 global trial is assessing PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA compared to platinum-containing 
chemotherapy, and we are pleased that this trial is projected to complete enrollment this year. EV-302 is intended 
to be a confirmatory trial for Cohort K, as well as supporting global marketing applications.
In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, we, together with Astellas and Merck, are advancing two phase 3 trials that 
are testing PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA as perioperative treatment in different populations. The 
KEYNOTE-B15 or EV-304 trial is enrolling cisplatin-eligible patients, and KEYNOTE-905 or EV-303 trial is 
enrolling cisplatin-ineligible patients.
Later this month, at ASCO GU, we plan to present the results of the EV-103 exploratory Cohort H. In this cohort, 
PADCEV monotherapy was given as neoadjuvant treatment of cisplatin-ineligible muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
patients for three cycles prior to cystectomy. Furthermore, we are pleased to announce that we have begun 
enrollment into the EV-104 trial of single-agent PADCEV in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In this study, 
PADCEV was administered intravesically in BCG nonresponsive patients. We are also studying PADCEV 
monotherapy in a basket trial of high Nectin-4 expressing solid tumors, including lung, breast, head and neck, 
gastric and esophageal cancer. This study continues to enroll patients and we await initial data this year to inform 
our next steps.
Turning to TUKYSA, we continue to advance our broad development program in breast and GI malignancies, as 
well as other solid tumors. Today, I will highlight a new study HER2CLIMB-05 which will evaluate TUKYSA in the 
frontline maintenance setting of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Standard of care for these patients 
typically includes six to eight cycles of a taxane with Herceptin and PERJETA otherwise known as THP. Once the 
chemotherapy is complete, Herceptin and PERJETA are continued as maintenance.
Despite the excellent results obtained with THP, patients remain at risk of relapse and death, including the risk of 
relapse in the brain. HER2CLIMB-05 randomized those patients who have completed THP to receive TUKYSA, 
Herceptin and PERJETA or Herceptin and PERJETA alone. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, 
and we expect to treat the first patient this quarter.
In GI cancers, we are awaiting results of the phase 2 MOUNTAINEER study, which are expected in the second 
half of this year. The study assesses TUKYSA and Herceptin as treatment for patients with previously treated 
HER2-positive colorectal cancer. Additional trials are studying TUKYSA in combination with oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapy in first-line GI cancers, as well as in combination with Herceptin in a basket trial for solid tumors 
with HER2 alterations.

I'll turn now to TIVDAK, which received accelerated approval in the United States for the treatment of patients with 
recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. A global phase 3 trial 
in cervical cancer, innovaTV 301 is currently enrolling in the EU and Asia, including Japan, with plans to expand 
to other regions such as LaTAm. This study is intended to serve as the confirmatory trial in the United States and 
importantly to support global regulatory applications.
Our next goal for TIVDAK is to move into earlier lines of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer. And in this 
regard, we presented combination data from the innovaTV 205 trial in the first- and second-line setting at ESMO
2021. This study will be expanded to further investigate additional multidrug combinations, including TIVDAK, 
combined with carboplatin and KEYTRUDA, with or without bevacizumab. The results from these new 
combinations will inform further development of TIVDAK in the first-line setting.
Beyond cervical cancer, we continue to study the potential for TIVDAK in other malignancies through an ongoing 
phase 2 trial, innovaTV 207. Preliminary data evaluating TIVDAK as treatment of head and neck cancer is being 
presented later this month at the ASTRO Head and Neck Cancers Symposium in Arizona.
Turning now to disitamab vedotin, or DV. In the second quarter of this year, we expect to begin enrolling our 
monotherapy trial in urothelial cancer. We are also focusing on the development of DV in HER2-low breast cancer 
based on encouraging monotherapy data generated by our partner RemeGen.
I'd like to now briefly mention our early-stage pipeline. We are evaluating multiple products in phase 1 clinical 
trials across a range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We recently reported first clinical data from 
two novel SEA programs. At ASH, we disclosed initial SEA-BCMA monotherapy data that demonstrated an 
encouraging early safety and efficacy profile in the first-line plus multiple myeloma setting.
In addition, we recently shared SEA-CD40 data in combination with chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1 in metastatic 
pancreatic cancer, in which we demonstrated evidence of immune activation in patients with an acceptable safety
profile and encouraging antitumor activity. Follow-up for survival is ongoing and will inform future development 
decisions. We are also enrolling a basket trial to assess SEA-CD40 combinations in other solid tumors, including 
melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.
In closing, we continue to make meaningful progress with our pipeline, and we look forward to providing you with 
updates on future calls. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Clay.

Geoff Meacham
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the real obvious one is, you guys have talked a lot about all the 
trends in the fourth quarter and last year, in the guidance for the three main products, one is down year-on-year 
and the other two are just marginally essentially flat line with fourth quarter. So is it – I guess, the need to be
conservative, but is there something that we should be aware of as it relates to the competitive backdrop for all of 
your products or the market itself? Just give us a little bit more detail on kind of the idea behind the guidance and 
maybe any individual kind of nuances that you'd want to point out. Thanks.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure, thanks, Geoff. So first of all, we like where we are positioned on all our brands. We have OS data in three of 
these brands [indiscernible] (00:34:44) we don't, TIVDAK is our newest drug. And that's something potentially for 
the future. These are real drugs. These are not incremental drugs and they really help patients. And as you know, 
building brands – it takes time to build them up. And we have tons of great catalysts coming out for 2022, which 
we certainly could go over. Our revenue guidance for 2022 is 6% to 11% higher than last year. Our product sales 
guidance is 7% to 12% growth over 2021. So we're certainly not guiding that as a company we're going down.
The one point about TUKYSA that if you want to talk about, the guidance is flat to slightly down for TUKYSA. And 
the rationale for that and really how we're thinking about it is, in brain mets TUKYSA is the most utilized drug for 
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in second and later lines, and the product is growing in Europe. But it's 
an evolving and dynamic marketplace. And with the advent of the ENHERTU DB03 trial, it's likely to have a nearterm effect on our growth, and that's reflected in our guidance. But we do expect MOUNTAINEER data in the 
second half of the year to support regulatory submission with potential label in 2023. So, there's a lot that we can 
do.
There's so many other things we're doing with TUKYSA. We have HER2CLIMB-02, as Roger mentioned, soon to 
start HER2CLIMB-05 in frontline maintenance, continued contributions from Europe as we secure reimbursement. 
So, I think the future is very bright for TUKYSA. That's where we are right now.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. We're really excited about what we can see with what we're going to be presenting at ASCO GU. Roger, 
can you outline a little bit what we are looking at and the context?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Clay. So the data that we'll be presenting from EV-103 Cohort H is PADCEV monotherapy in the 
neoadjuvant setting. And these are folks who are cisplatin-ineligible with MIBC. And so, they've not yet undergone 
any surgery. So what this will do, and when the data is presented publicly you will have a better understanding 
and a better indicator of what PADCEV as a monotherapy is able to achieve in this disease stage.
We're excited to have the data presented, but it is important to just note that the ongoing registration trials that are 
being run, which are mentioned in the prepared remarks, are focusing on the combination of KEYTRUDA plus 
PADCEV. KEYTRUDA has already shown meaningful activity in this population. When we've shared the PADCEV 
data, there will be an understanding of what PADCEV can do. And then some idea of potentially what a 
combination could produce.

means, a precedent there? And are you able to say what party submitted the additional evidence? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Thanks for the questions. So as we said, the arbitration hearing was reopened, so I'm just want to repeat this, and 
by the arbitrator to consider additional evidence. As a result, the decision may occur after the first quarter. We 
don't know exactly at this point. And what's important is for us to say is that legal matters are confidential and 
they're pending. And it is not appropriate for us to discuss them in detail. However, what I will say is we believe 
that our case is strong. We continue to believe that, we have no change whatsoever in our belief in our case, and 
this delayed resolution does not change our view that we have a great case.

growth than pricing growth, which is a little bit different from some of the trends for the last 15 years or so. I just 
want to hear how you're thinking about that for 2022 and beyond. Thanks.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thank you, Kennen, for the question. Todd, would you like to comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks, Kennen. I'll try to jump in here. I think, when you look across the brand, we are projecting volume 
growth. We have, as you know, historically done price increases, although today we're not commenting on which 
prices we have or will or won't do. But what we've tried to do with our guidance is really kind of look across each 
of the brands, look at where we are. For example, with ADCETRIS, this is a drug that's been on the market 10 or 
11 years. It's an incredible drug that has helped a lot of patients. And we're projecting growth this year because 
we think we can continue to increase adoption. And we commented on the call with the OS data that we 
presented last year. I'll point out that those data are only out in topline form right now. We're looking forward to 
presenting the full dataset at a medical conference later in the year. So we haven't tried to assume uptake in our 
guidance based on that, but it's certainly positive.
I think PADCEV, we'll see as a nice growth year. We continue to see patients that are completing checkpoint 
inhibitor maintenance therapy in the frontline setting that fall really nicely into the current labeled indications. And 
of course, we've got clinical trials underway to continue to broaden the labels, which is the longer term goal.
And then with TUKYSA, we've been on the market now approaching two years in the US. We're starting to reach 
steady-state there. Europe continues to grow. But as Chip mentioned in the call, we're also aware that nicely for 
patients the treatment landscape continues to evolve here. So we think TUKYSA is going to continue to be an 
important drug. And as Roger mentioned, there's a lot of work underway to move it into earlier line combination 
settings with drugs like KADCYLA in the HER2CLIMB-05 trial setting, as maintenance therapy, and then of course 
the colorectal data. And hopefully that leads to a label next year out of the MOUNTAINEER trial.
So we're really bullish on the drugs. This is a little bit of a year of executing on clinical trials which is what you've 
got to do to generate data to support label expansions, and that's been a stated goal of ours for a long time.

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for all the comments on the product guidance 
you've already provided. I guess I was just hoping on TUKYSA to ask a bit more specific questions. So could you 
comment, so far in 2021 what impact you've seen from the DESTINY-Breast03 results for ENHERTU and have 
you seen share loss – off-label share loss from ENHERTU being used there? And then can you give us some 
sense of how much of an impact you're thinking this is going to cause in 2022? That would be very helpful. 
Thanks.

Right. Well, in 2021, it's not really where we're predicting the impact, it's really in 2022. Chip, do you want to give 
a little bit of color on that?

Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Hi. Thanks. And appreciate all the color you guys have given. Maybe one on the EMA pause of the PADCEV 
review. You mentioned that there was a positive CHMP decision. Didn't this include a consideration of the skin 
rash in Stevens-Johnson syndrome that has been seen previously? Just trying to understand what's new about 
what was seen in the French compassionate use program that caused the EMA to pause the review?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we had some severe skin reactions in a – as you pointed out, and as we stated 
at French compassionate access program. This is a well-documented side effect and it's very consistent with our 
USPI. Look, safety is our highest priority for patients, but we believe, fully, that the benefit-risk profile is 
unchanged for PADCEV. And we're excited with this drug. It's been used in many, many thousands of patients in 
the US. Docs use it well in the US, understand how to use it. And, it's important to for docs around the world to 
use it according to the label.
Roger, do you want to add any additional color?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. So Andy, I think that the – this is the European regulatory process that we're going through. And, the exact 
reason why a decision is made to pause on an approval is really for the regulators to make that call. But just to 
reiterate what Clay is saying. There's nothing in the data that we're aware of, that we see that is any different from 
what we've generated elsewhere and what is currently reflected very clearly in the USPI

us that they use the drug predominantly in patients with brain mets and that would really not change based on the 
new ENHERTU data. So just wondering what your market research there says.
And then on the other hand, PADCEV guidance for 2022 is actually higher than what we expected, especially 
since you have stated in the past that you already have very high market penetration in bladder cancer in the US. 
And so just wondering how you see the market evolving there in the near term that – and what the growth drivers 
could be for PADCEV in 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
So, first of all, let's start with PADCEV. And, our guidance shows about a 30% growth over 2021. So we believe 
PADCEV is really helping patients. And there's a lot we can talk about with this, but we believe it's still a growth 
opportunity post checkpoint – post checkpoints and post checkpoint ineligible patients, which is reflected in our 
guidance. And so checkpoint inhibitors have grown the market for PADCEV, actually. And so we're excited with 
that. But we're also excited for we're going to get data in Cohort K this year. It's not in our guidance because we're 
going to get – we expect the data in the second half of the year. And so we think that based on the timing for 
submitting that and everything, the approval wouldn't happen until 2023. So obviously we couldn't put that into 
2022 guidance.
We do expect to complete enrollment of EV-302 this year, which is to support global submissions in first-line 
urothelial cancer, regardless of whether you're cis-eligible or ineligible. And we're going to have presentations 
very soon on muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which is a bigger opportunity than metastatic disease. And then the 
trials are underway, not only muscle-invasive but in non-muscle-invasive, which is a much bigger opportunity. And 
we also have basket trials enrolling. So expect data this year – initial data of basket trials.
So when you look at PADCEV, you look at our guidance of a 30% growth and where we are with no new labels 
for the year. Yeah, the products still doing really well. So I appreciate you pointing that out. As far as TUKYSA 
goes, we have discussed everything here. We believe it will still be used, and doctors rely on it in terms of brain 
mets. So that's something that we're really happy about.
The other thing is, one of the things that's kind of a bit interesting is docs use – the duration of use of TUKYSA 
had been strong. So we're really pleased with that. And I don't know if you found that out in your market 
assessment, but docs – often, you see a drug that – you do a clinical trial and you see a shorter duration in the 
real world. That's not what we're seeing in the real world. We're seeing something that's very good. But we do –
we are including our guidance some effect of the DB03 trial. It's not just – TUKYSA is not just used in brain met 
patients, although that's a very big area, it's also used in patients with visceral disease.
And, Chip, do you want to give any color on that part of patients and a little bit about our guidance of what we're 
thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seagen Inc. A
Sure, Clay. So, as I mentioned in the past calls, we've seen uptake in both patients with and without brain 
metastases. TUKYSA has strong data in both of those patient subsets. So we're seeing really broad utilization. 
TUKYSA established itself as an important treatment option, especially for patients that do have brain 
metastases. So our thinking around this is that we're going to continue to get utilization. We're going to continue 
to work to make sure that every eligible patient has an option that is available to them that that physicians, quite 
frankly, have anchored to this since launch. But we look forward to continuing to promote the product. The

Boris Peaker
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Great. I just want to follow up on TUKYSA and the new HER2CLIMB-05 that you announced earlier today. Just 
thinking given the relatively good prospects for these patients, how large will this trial be? How long do you think it 
will take? And based on that kind of estimated time of completion, how much exclusivity do you think that will be 
left on TUKYSA at that point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
We haven't outlined everything. Roger, can you give a little color and context on TUKYSA HER2CLIMB-05 trial?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah, sure. So as you heard us in our prepared remarks, outlining what this trial will do is from a medical 
perspective it's very appealing. Yes, the frontline therapy with THP is successful, but there are still patients who 
relapse. And using TUKYSA in a maintenance mode like this to us and actually to physicians as well has a lot of 
appeal and makes a lot of sense.
The size of the trial, the assumptions of the treatment effects, the rates of the events are all things that will 
influence timing. But we've decided to move ahead with the trial. So we believe that based on its size, based on 
how long it will take and based on when we expect the readout that we will have a meaningful opportunity, if the 
trial is successful, to commercialize that indication.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. We think this is – the appeal of the trial, as Roger says, goes to the factor of how quickly you can enroll. 
And as far as timing goes, the faster you could enroll, the faster you can have the data and go toward helping 
patients on the commercial market. So we're really excited with the trial. We believe it's strongly positive from a 
financial standpoint, and we're excited in going forward.

Hi, this is Bonnie Quach on for Steve Willey. I just had a quick question for your top line results that we anticipate

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Well, we have said we'd have data in the second half of this year. I think that the specifics of what we expect or 
what it will look like, we'll just have to wait until the data come out. And our intention is with these type of data, 
we'd put out top line but we'd also present it at a conference as fast as we can and, obviously, write our 
publication. That's what we usually do, and we would continue to do that. But as soon as possible, after gaining –
allowing the time to go on to really watch the trial and make sure that we see the appropriate data duration and 
everything, safety and all the different features that you need to see, we will put out the top line data at our 
soonest appropriate timing, so – and that's second half of this year.

Hey, thanks for the update, and thanks for taking the question. I want to follow up on your clinical development 
strategy in breast cancer. Based on the work you're doing with TUKYSA in combination with ENHERTU, and also 
considering the evolving standard of care in HER2-positive breast cancer that you mentioned, would you consider 
studying ENHERTU as an active comparator in first-line breast cancer and/or adjuvant treatment setting? And 
then related to that, how are you thinking about the potential to add disitamab vedotin into your breast cancer 
portfolio as a – either as a stand-alone agent or in combination with TUKYSA? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Thank you for the question. Some of this, we've thought about – we've talked about, some of it is not 
publicly released yet and information we're not ready to talk about. But Roger, can you give a little more color on 
TUKYSA in first and adjuvant? And then maybe just a little color on DV and what we're thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So the TUKYSA development program, as we've presented and as it's laid out, does cover almost all 
aspect of breast cancer, including this new trial, which is a true frontline trial. And the approach we've taken 
because TUKYSA is a drug that is appropriate for combinations, it's a small molecule HER2 TKI. It profoundly 
inhibits the pathway. We've shown now with HER2CLIMB that inhibiting HER2 signaling both from outside the cell 
and inside the cell is a right sort of medical strategy to follow. And so in principle, combining TUKYSA with 
ENHERTU makes complete sense. Two very active agents. Same type of principle with the chemotherapy 
delivery and a trastuzumab binder. And that applies also to disitamab vedotin, which is an optimized antibody with 
a vedotin payload aimed at HER2. And TUKYSA is obviously in that space with the HER2 overexpressing or the 
HER2 amplified. So we haven't disclosed plans. But it's an obvious question that we're looking at very carefully, 
which is what is the synergy between those two products and how would we develop those two in – as a 
combination. So that's under serious consideration.
Beyond that though, concepts like head to heads against ENHERTU, it's not an obvious thing, I think that's in our 
thinking. But of course, we wouldn't exclude any possible trial if it made sense.

Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, two questions, so regarding ADCETRIS, congratulations on the OS win. 
Just wondering if you mind sharing with us about how that 40%-plus reduction in the risk of death could change 
perception and prescribing pattern?
And the second question is really on the Nectin-4 expression in lung cancer. So the EV-202 study, you're looking 
at lung cancer, but it's not biomarker-selected. Just curious about what kind of data inform that decision. Thank 
you.

Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. Well, let's start with the ADCETRIS data. Look, we're thrilled at the OS. I mean, this is a long time coming 
and it's in a disease Hodgkin lymphoma, which takes a long time to watch and monitor and look at this. But it's 
very clear to us that this is a great regimen and we're excited to present the data in full detail, not just topline at a 
conference by the investigators.
And so, Roger, can you talk a little bit about the impact of the risk of death and what we can do about this with 
regulators, et cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, as Clay said, this is a great result because, historically, it has been very difficult to improve overall 
survival in Hodgkin lymphoma. I mean that's good news because patients have good outcomes, but [ph] E-1 
(01:01:36) after multiple years of follow-up has actually reached the point, and it's a pre-specified outcome. So 
this is an endpoint that was defined in the protocol in terms of how many events one needs and such.
And so it has the potential, once we've presented the data publicly and worked through all of the information that 
we will get, it has the potential to be – to form part of things such as regulatory submissions because of the nature 
of – the way the trial was conducted. So I think the first sort of data point is to present it publicly, let everyone see 
the full data set, as Clay mentioned. And we're obviously thinking about all those other components as well.
With regard – do you want me to answer the EV-202 question?

Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Roger.

Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So it's a great question, Andy, with regard to biomarker expression. What I would say and we haven't 
disclosed the information, but the trial is moving along, and we are clearly at some point in the next – in a while, 
we'll start to talk about some data and present. I can't comment on which particular cohort we'll look at. But in 
general, from a biomarker perspective, clearly we measure and we evaluate Nectin-4 in all cohorts. We enroll all 
comers, but we evaluate the biomarker. And so if there was – if it was appropriate to enrich a population using a 
biomarker, that's something we would do. Again, I'm not saying that is what we're doing, but if that were – if that 
produced a response rate that we found compelling, we would be able to do that.

Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one. Can you talk a little bit more about SEACD40? The updated ASCO GI we thought was pretty compelling. The response rates look pretty good. So just 
trying to think about next steps, what are the gating steps, I guess, to pursue a phase 2 trial and then a 
registrational study?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yeah. Thank you for the question, Ren. SEA-CD40 continues to be a drug we're very interested in. I think you're 
asking about next steps in pancreatic cancer after the data we put out at ASCO GI. Certainly there was 
encouraging antitumor activity in a disease that's arguably one of the worst cancers [indiscernible] (01:04:15) 
incredibly difficult to treat disease in general. But what we're looking at, we want to make sure these stand the test 
of time. And I want to – we need to evaluate the survival curves over a little bit of a longer period of time before 
we make any final decisions.
And so I think it's important – it's hard to know until you really see the durable data, to know – even if you're going 
forward, it's like how do you size this, what are the statistics you needed to study, what's the appropriate way to 
talk to regulators. You need the right data set. So I'm very proud of the work we're doing on this horrible disease. 
The initial data was encouraging, but we have been very clear that we want to see the full Kaplan-Meier curves 
and how they compare to what we think that some of the best regimens of the day – of today would work. So, stay 
tuned on that. It's something we talk about regularly and it's just a little premature to give you any more definitive 
data yet. So, stay tuned.

Zhiqiang Shu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to ask about PADCEV EV-104 in a non-muscleinvasive bladder cancer, given pembro is approving this indication on single arm accelerated approval. What do 
you expect this trial to achieve? Do you think the data could be sufficient for approval? Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Yes. Thanks for the question. Roger, do you want to address that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seagen Inc. A
Sure. So, we have just begun. I think we're very excited. And the potential to use – to use PADCEV installed 
directly into the bladder is a pretty compelling argument if, indeed, the product is both safe and effective. And 
provided there's an accelerated approval path available for BCG nonresponsive population. Again without saying 
that we would or we wouldn't do it, that in at least in theory is a potential approach. So, I would say we are still 
working out whether PADCEV will produce the type of efficacy we hope to see, and we could potentially move 
forward with the late line population. That is one possible outcome.

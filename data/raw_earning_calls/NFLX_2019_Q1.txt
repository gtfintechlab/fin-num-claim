PRESENTATION
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Good afternoon, and welcome to Netflix Q1 2019 earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today
are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this
quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS.
As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, let me turn it over to Eric for the first question.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Thank you, Spencer. Reed, I'd love to start with you. Now that we're 3 months into 2019, against your broader goals for what you're expecting for
the business in 2019, what are the key messages you want to share with investors on how the first 3 months of the year went?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Well, we put in the earnings letter our weekly net adds, and it's just phenomenal, how steady and smooth and up and to the right that is, to start
off the year with over 9.5 million net additions. It's a phenomenal start. So steady progress, basically the same as many prior quarters, cranking
away on amazing content, amazing service and steady growth around the world.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe sticking with that theme on the subscriber front, we'd love to understand some of what you saw internationally in subscriber strength.
There were some particular pieces of content that seem to resonate globally on an individual and on a worldwide basis. So would love to ask both
from a content perspective and a subscriber growth perspective, maybe to Ted and Greg, how you're thinking about the subscriber performance,
especially internationally in Q1.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, the one thing that was good about in terms of the content connection is the things that worked best that we called out in the letter are things
that worked around the world, which is really fantastic. And then we had some great international breakouts where they really help drive excitement.

APRIL 16, 2019 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q1 2019 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
And by way of an example, Kingdom in Korea, that did phenomenal and get watched and is getting watched all over the world and throughout
the region. So yes, we've been able to work on a very local basis and a very global basis with the content this year -- this quarter.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
And then from a product perspective, yes, the basic model that we've seen, and consistently across pretty much all the markets that we operate
in is, as we launch our service, we get a chance to learn from our members. They tell us what content we incrementally need to provide to them.
We do a better and better job at that, how we modify the product experience, what we need to add from a payments perspective, from a partner's
perspective. And we're seeing that basically in all the markets that we operate in the world. And so the longer we've been in that territory, like
Europe is a great example, we've got a lot of stuff dialed in. And consumers are really loving us, and that's leading to great, accelerating growth.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Ted, maybe following up with you. On local content that goes global, you've got a number of hits now that started as local language and went
global. Are you getting better at identifying what those pieces of content might be? What are your learnings as you're getting more of those types
of successes in the model?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, we've kept one strict principle around it, which was that these shows had to be very locally relevant. And to do that, you have to be pretty
authentically local. So what we're trying not to do is try to inauthentically make a global show because basically that doesn't work for anybody. So
the more authentically local the show is, the better it travels, which we've seen with Kingdom. So fans of K drama around the world loved that
show, and it resonated incredibly well for us in Korea. Similarly, coming up, we have a new season of Rain coming out this quarter that is perfectly
Swedish. We don't try to make it -- water it down or make it travel any better inorganically and have found that the best way to make global stories
is to make them incredibly, authentically local.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
So Greg, maybe coming back to you on the subscriber front. You had some information in the letter about the amount of traffic globally that you
get from mobile. We're continuing to see performance above what we thought in terms of download of Netflix app on phones globally. Can you
talk a little bit about mobile as a stimulant for both traffic subscriber growth and how you might go after that on the product side over the medium
and long term?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Sure. I think the most important -- the headline message there is actually frankly how much time we don't win on the mobile experience, right? So
over 97.5% around the world, people are using other different entertainment services, other ways to enjoy their time on their mobile phone. But
certainly, what we are seeing is that mobile is an increasing way for us to attract new subscribers. It's a great place for folks to find out about Netflix,
to sign up to the service even if they're signing up to the service on mobile and then they're watching on other devices like the TV, which we see
as the common paradigm. And it works really well with our partners because whether it's handset partners, which we can work to sort of preload
our application on; or actually the mobile operators, which we can work on increasingly, doing things like bundling the Netflix as part of their
standard offering, which you see us doing more and more around the world, it's a great way for us to make it super simple for our members to sign
up for Netflix and enjoy that experience.

APRIL 16, 2019 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q1 2019 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe I'll start with Spence but would love a couple of different perspectives on this. There was a solid outperformance on margin in the quarter,
and the company talked about shifting some expenses into the later part of the year than maybe what you'd envisioned when you guided Q1. Can
you talk a little bit about how the cost structure evolved in the business in Q1, how that margin outperformance came about? And maybe give a
little bit more granularity on those shifting costs as you look through the better part of 2019.
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Yes. Sure, Eric. I mean I think the takeaway is we're overall very pleased with our continued margin progression. We guided at the beginning of the
year to increasing our margins by 300 basis points for the full year to 13%. We came in this quarter slightly ahead. Part of that is we're continuing
to scale our business in terms of some combination of content and marketing spend, in particular growing at a slower rate than revenue. In this
quarter in particular, I think you saw that on the marketing line where we had a lot of both growth and experimentation in marketing last year,
which we talked about. We talked about the fact that we would level off that growth this year, and you saw that come to play in Q1, which was a
meaningful driver of that margin expansion. The timing in the quarter was not all that significant. There were some spend in -- particularly on
timing of some creative spend and creative development spend on the marketing side, and particularly that shifted to later in the year as well as
some content spend but nothing material, and we're well on track to that 13% full year margin.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
And just to follow up there, Spence, just to make sure we understand the message from the letter. Still, second half versus first half should be the
way investors think about the margin profile of the business this year against that broader 13% goal.
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Yes. Generally, I mean you'll see some margin expansion as you can see in the guide for Q2 as well, and then it will continue to expand in the back
half of the year. As you know, there have been some price adjustments in the first half of the year that will be flowing through that also. Between
that and just on member growth, we'll see the benefit of that margin expansion in the back half.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe one more on the quarter and the letter itself, back to you, Ted. For the second quarter in a row, you gave a lot of information about
consumption of the product in the quarter and some of the watch statistics. So I'd love both Ted and Reed maybe to weigh in on how you think
about the type of watch and engagement statistics the company is getting when measured against the broader media landscape, what that means
for the company longer term and whether we can expect to continue to hear that from the company going forward.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes, definitely. We're trying to get to a place where we could be a lot more transparent, both with our producers and with our customers who are
incredibly interested in helping them make better choices by -- based on -- and so a lot of times, that's influenced heavily by what's the world
watching. So being able to share some of those numbers gives people a better sense of what things that they might be interested in as well. And
just real quickly, I'll correct myself, Eric, I said Sweden for Rain, but obviously the show's from Denmark. But -- and -- what I wanted to do is point
out that over the next several months, we're going to be rolling out more specific, granular reporting, first to our producers and then to our members
and, of course, to the press over time and be more fully transparent about what people are watching on Netflix around the world.

APRIL 16, 2019 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q1 2019 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
And Reed, how do you think about the broader media landscape, what Netflix is trying to solve for and go after as a big opportunity over time
when measured against the type of watch or engagement statistics the company's putting up against their original content?
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
I think we're just beginning to start to share that data, as Ted mentioned, and we'll be leaning into that more quarter by quarter. But the big picture
for our members is they watch all kinds of things. I mean our members are watching pay-per-view and DVDs. Our members are watching linear.
Our members are watching -- or playing Fortnite. It's all of these things. So think of it as -- the real metric is can we keep our members happy and
grow that subscriber base as we did so strongly in Q1.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
So maybe sticking with you, Reed, you had a section of the letter about Disney, some of the competition that's coming to the broader landscape.
Maybe just help people frame how you see the competitive landscape, how you see those types of products existing alongside or in competition
to Netflix and what your sort of view is of the landscape going forward.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Sure. Well, one part is great competition makes you better, and so we're thrilled to have Apple and Disney in. They're awesome companies. Just to
be in the same league as them is very exciting for us. And then on a practical basis, there's already so much competition. I mean we mentioned we
only win 2% of downloading on mobile. Like 98% of the time people are not doing Netflix on U.S. television, that 90% are not watching Netflix. So
there's a ton of competition out there. And Disney and Apple add a little bit more. But frankly, I doubt it will be material because again there's
already so many competitors for entertainment time, which is great for consumers, and it's exciting for us.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Greg, I'd love to take that answer and maybe go to you next of how you think about the product itself when you see potential new competitors
come into the field, what you think some of the big differentiators you have on the product side, how you think about pricing as a company longer
term and maybe where you want to take the product medium, long term.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Sure. I mean again back to Reed's model, we sort of see this broad landscape of competition, and our job is to think about every touch point that
we have with the service and how can we make it incrementally more compelling, how do we connect our members with the amazing content
that we're making in a way which is new and differentiating. You talked about international. That's a great opportunity where we think about
localizing this content well, whether it's in subtitles or dubbing and then actually explaining to our members, connecting our members with those
stories in a meaningful way, which then opens up them to watch TV shows or movies from around the world from countries that they never would
have conceived of doing before. And I think that's a huge example of the opportunity we have to bring this global platform to bear in the right
kind of product experience to create differentiation. And then with regard to pricing, I would say again back to this sort of framework of broad,
broad competition where a bunch of different entertainment options are being provided, all sorts of different models, some in ad-based subscription
at different pricing points. We don't really think there's sort of an immediate equivalency or substitution. And so mostly, it's about how do we create
more value, how do we create the right content and present it at the right way that's compelling and differentiating for our members. And we
think we do a great job at that. We'll just win more of those viewing hours, we'll deliver more value to our members and we'll be able to grow from
a subscriber perspective like we did this quarter.

APRIL 16, 2019 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q1 2019 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe turning to Q2 where you laid out -- the company laid out its vision for subscriber growth and talked a little bit about ARPU in Q2 as well.
Maybe talk a little bit broadly, I don't know, maybe Spence and then going to Greg as well, talk about the building blocks of the way in which you're
framing the subscriber growth going forward in Q2, the price increases that are going through a number of jurisdictions, what that means for ARPU,
what it means for churn so investors can better understand that.
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Yes. Sure, I can start it, and then others can chime in. You can see that we guided to 5 million paid net adds in Q2, which is similar to where we were
a year ago. There's definitely some seasonality to our business, which we see in Q2. You see that again this year. But I'd say, in general, our paid net
adds are very much in line with what we've been planning and targeting for the year. On a first half of the year basis, you see that 7% year-over-year
growth. The specific growth in Q2 is more concentrated internationally. That's just, as we talked about last quarter, we're rolling through our price
changes in the U.S., so that has some moderation on our net adds. And the good news there is that our -- the growth in our acquisition that we're
acquiring are -- it's consistent in terms of our ability to kind of grow our subscribers. There's just some temporary churn that enters the system in
the midst of rolling out those price changes. But that's why you see more of the net adds weighted to our international segments in Q2 but overall
very healthy, going according to plan and very strong growth for the first half of the year and putting us on track, as we also mentioned in the
letter, for another year of record paid net add growth for the full year.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
And Eric, just to add on to what Spence said, you'll -- in the guidance, you'll see that there is an acceleration in ASP growth as well as in revenue
growth in Q2 relative to Q1, and that's a function of some of those price adjustments that we talked about earlier.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
One maybe follow-up because it did come in, in advance in a number of ways. When you think about churn with the price increase, do you look
to historical trends? Or do you look to sort of near-term trends? Because this was an interesting price increase that it started rolling into effect in
the middle of Q1, and it appears it will be done in terms of going into effect towards the middle of the back end of Q2. Were there historical trends
you can look through to anchor yourself to? Or are you sort of looking at other recent price increases on markets like Canada and others to inform
how to guide?
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Do you want me to take that? Or...
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Sure. I would just say maybe that there's a bunch of historical performance and modeling that we used to keep an eye on these things. But generally,
I would say things are going as expected. And this is one of those relatively infrequent moments where as we invest more in the service, more great
content, we got incredible movies coming like Irishman, Six Underground, improving the product experience, we occasionally go back to our
subscribers and ask them to contribute a little bit more so that we can fund that next cycle of growth. And everything that we're seeing right now
is very consistent with that model.

APRIL 16, 2019 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q1 2019 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
I would just add on to Greg, too, that, as you know, even in the U.S., we, -- for the first time, we increased our entry-level pricing, and the overall
blended price increase was a bit -- as a result, a little bit more significant than last time around. And even with that, the churn levels are very
consistent with more elastic pricing in the U.S., so it's all consistent with the plan and consistent with what we've seen historically.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Along those lines, with pricing being driven by success on the content front, Ted, maybe you could talk a little bit, it's a very full content schedule
as you get through Q2 and in the back part of the year, maybe frame a little bit about what you're excited to bring to members on Netflix, how
that's lining up against some of the key investments you're making in some of the buckets like movies, local language content and some of the
returning series that people know well on the platform.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes. Well, definitely, in the third quarter, we've got new episodes and new seasons of some of our most-loved and most-watched shows on Netflix:
Stranger Things; La Casa de Papel; Orange is the New Black; 13 Reasons Why, Elite, which is a big hit for us right out of Spain; new season from Ryan
Murphy of The Politician, a brand-new show in Netflix, that we think our audience is going to love. And then you'll start seeing later in the fourth
quarter some of our bigger film investments coming through like Irishman, like Six Underground and also a big new original series that we're
currently shooting in Hungary called The Witcher. That is enormous European IP, very popular game and book IP that we think is going to make a
really fun global series. So we've got -- and then moving into our kids and family and our animated originals, both on the feature side and on the
series side, 2 of the bigger bets, Klaus will be on our fourth quarter animated features; and Green Eggs and Ham from Ellen Degeneres exec producing
a very ambitious 13-episode animated original series with a feature quality animation that's been in the works for about 4 years, we're really excited
to bring to our members in the fourth quarter.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Looking out to Q2 and the rest of the year, would love to ask a little bit about what you're seeing in India. I know you don't break out subscriber
additions but would love to understand some of the investments you made in content in India, how those investments in content are resonating
in the marketplace. And then maybe, Greg, you can pick it up and talk a little bit about the product side and what you're seeing from an adoption
standpoint in India as well.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes. Well, we've been -- we were super encouraged out of the gate with Love Per Square Foot and Sacred Games where not only do we get a lot
of viewing in India, but it just -- it took an incredible position in the night guys where people are talking about and writing about the excitement
of a show of the quality of Sacred Games. And then recently, we followed it up again with Delhi Crime that people are also really loving it in India
and is getting watched outside of India as well. But most importantly, it's a steady drumbeat and then add to that another dozen original films
coming in India that we're seeing the investment in local language content in India pay back in the form of excitement and member growth and
hours growth that's encouraging us to keep going.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
And as we sort of have that ongoing content investment and we're really providing stories that Indian consumers really love, it's an opportunity
for us to look at how we broaden the accessibility of the service then to more and more Indian consumers. And so part of that is making sure we
have the right payments models in place and innovating and testing what our new models to make any consumer feel like they have existing ways
of paying that are natural for them that they can use to pay for Netflix. There's also a bunch of partnership stuff. We launched a big partnership

with Airtel, which is working for us quite well, so we can use different go-to-market mechanisms that already exist that Indian consumers are familiar
with to make it easy for them to just sign up for the service and try it out. And then frankly, we're also trying to do a bunch of experimentation with
just our plan structure and thinking about pricing and plans and what do we do to test different models that allow us to bring a lower price plan
with the right feature set at the right price in a way that the Indian consumer and frankly consumers around the world can understand so we can
broaden the accessibility of the service now, right? So all of that's an ongoing effort, and we think it's a great match for the broadening of the Indian
content catalog that we have.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Well, maybe if I can just follow up one with that, Greg. It does seem like a mobile-only, maybe lower-priced product could open up a lot of demand
in the developing world. How do you think about some of the opportunities and the challenges when you think about a mobile-only offering or
something at a lower price point in trying to get the mix of content versus subscriber economics right?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Yes. And I think that's a great example of something that we're trying out. We're not positive that's the right model, but it's -- we're quite certain
that we should do something to find a price tier that's lower than the existing lowest-priced tier to broaden that accessibility. We think that, that
will be important to adding members in India. We'll see what the right mix of features is because there is a bit of a magic to try and get the right
set of features at the right price point in a way that the consumer can relate to, right? It has to be sort of natural and intuitive to the consumer that
this is what they're getting. So we've got more work to go do there, but it's something we're highly focused on and anticipate we'll make more
progress towards on.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe turning next to M&A and the broader strategy for the company, Reed, I'd love to start with you. As you look at the strategy you've laid out
for the company over the medium to long term, how do you think about some of the aspects of the strategy that might be better to dwell and
acquire versus build yourself against the big long-term opportunity? And maybe I'll follow up with one for Spence.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
I don't think investors have too much to worry about there. We've been going for 20 years. We've done 1 or 2 micro acquisitions but no big appetite,
no big need. We got clear sailing ahead. If we can produce the world's best content, we can deliver it with the best user interface, then we can grow
for many, many years ahead. So that's what we're focused on. A lot of tough executions, just keeping ourselves all focused on that. And then we're
letting other companies be -- do many different strategies. But we know what ours is, and we're having a lot of fun just executing them.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Okay. Spence, I wanted to jump off the M&A question and ask more about capital allocation. You're now more settled in your role than -- I think it
was 7 or 8 days when we did this interview 3 months ago, so I'm going to grill you a little bit harder on what you're seeing in your role, what you
see as some of the big opportunities for you to tackle in the role as CFO here at the company and how that fits into the broader capital allocation
sort of pecking order for what the company is trying to accomplish.
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Yes. I think it's very much aligned with what Reed just mentioned in terms of we just see this incredible growth profile for the business if we remain
focused and execute it at this giant market that is continuing to shift from linear to on-demand and streaming, so there's a giant market opportunity

globally. And we want to execute against that, so that ties into our focus in terms of capital allocation and getting smarter and smarter about how
we allocate our content dollars in programming mix and in partnering with Ted and the team and continuing to invest in the product and the
experience with Greg and his team. So that's where we're most focused on and then helping to continue to scale our company. So we intend to
be a much larger and much more profitable self-funding company over time. That is the path we're on. As we talked about in the letter, we're
committed to improve our cash flow profile meaningfully, starting in 2020 and then each year thereafter. And we'll continue our capital structure
similar to how we funded it to date to continue on that path. We've talked a lot about that in the past. So to me, it's really about helping the team
continue to focus, remain disciplined and build that -- continue to build that muscle of increasing profitability and improving our cash flow profile
as we scale.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Maybe one more for you, following up there, Spence. Came into me in a couple of different ways from a lot of debt investors asking about the
expansion of the credit facility, the prior comment about free cash flow improving in '20 over '19. How should investors think about the self-funding
component versus the need to continue to tap the debt capital markets as you think of funding the business initiatives inside of the company?
Spencer Adam Neumann - Netflix, Inc. - CFO
Yes. Well, there's no real change in our philosophy or our strategy. So we did expand our revolver recently. We did that just because as the business
has gotten larger, it was an opportunity for us at the same cost of capital. So it's there for a rainy day. We don't -- we haven't used it. We don't intend
to use it, but we thought it was prudent to take advantage of. And we'll continue on our path of funding with the high-yield market. As you know,
we have a very significant cushion between our total equity capitalization and our debt-to-capital ratio. We also have a high level of interest in
those -- in the debt-funding markets. It is the most efficient cost of capital for us. We spent a lot of time -- I spent a lot of time as the new CFO
focused on our liquidity, our payment timing and our cash flow need and feel very comfortable with this approach to our capital structure. And as
I said, this is -- it's not forever in terms of using the debt markets to fund our cash flow needs because we are moving toward that self-funding path,
as I said, starting in 2020.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So I think the message, Eric, to debt investors is you better get in soon because there's not going to be that much more to go.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Duly noted. Maybe sticking with content, but I'd love to start with Reed, and then go to Ted. Probably, the most important question I get a lot from
investors is thinking through the narrative of some of the licensed content that's been popular on the platform coming off over the next couple
of years due to some of the industry players making their own decisions and how you think about aligning your own investments around your
own original content to fill in any gaps that happen from a consumption standpoint. Maybe just starting with you, Reed, how do you think about
the content landscape and how it feeds into the competitive landscape? And Ted, I would love to understand from you how that feeds into the
planning for content not only in '19 but over maybe the short or medium term over the next couple of years.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Well, we don't think about it as filling in. That's very minimalist. We think about it as can we change the world with great stories. And we're so
thrilled to be able to have the money to do that and to invest forward. And I think you'll see that the series and the movies and the reality that we're
doing, the nature programming. I mean you look at Our Planet. That's not filling in for anything else. That's setting a bold, new vision of what
programming can be. And so we're charging forward. Again, we've expected the decline of second window content, been ready for it, anticipating
it. In fact, we're eager to be able to have more and more of our money, be able to do spectacular new titles. So let me pass it over to you, Ted.

APRIL 16, 2019 / 10:00PM, NFLX - Q1 2019 Netflix Inc Earnings Call
Client Id: 77
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes, I 100% concur. And I think what's -- the thing to keep in mind is this is 7 years ago when we thought it was likely that the studios and networks
would like to keep their second windows for themselves over time that we better start getting good at creating our own programming and getting
in business with creators who could do that for us and with us. And that's what we set out to do. And over every year, our percentage of spend,
our percentage of hours watched have continued to grow towards our own owned original and branded shows on Netflix and films. And when
trying to do that across all the things that people love, scripted series, unscripted series, feature films, documentaries, stand-up comedy, great kids
programming, as Reed said, it isn't just replacing one thing for another, we have this great You vs. Wild, which is an interactive show for kids. It's
mostly being done with families that they can watch interactively together and will have about 25 million people spending a lot of time on You
vs. Wild in the first 28 days on Netflix, which is incredible success. And it's pushing storytelling forward, which I think we're going to be doing with
things like The Irishman, both in terms of windows of availability and also in the kind of the technical execution of great storytelling. And that's
what we're really after. So there's a lot of focus on what's licensed and how much gets watched, all those things. And so in the entire history of
television, there are lots and lots of hours of programming that people watch fairly interchangeably, but the shows that we -- that our members
most value us for and the things that we really pay a lot of attention to, you look at our top 10 most-watched shows on Netflix, they're all Netflix
original brands. And in the top 25, there's only 4 shows that have at least a single season that cracked into the top 25 even. So increasingly, our
business is about creating and telling great stories around the world that are exclusively on Netflix and giving opportunity for new storytellers all
over the world.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Eric, I would just add, if you look at the multiyear sort of track record of the company, we've gone through different periods of the content library
changing, whether it was EPIX or stores. And generally, we've been able to sort of adjust the content library and really grow right through that.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Yes. And it's hard to imagine, but it's 2017, a couple of years ago, when Fox had sunset all of their second-window content on Netflix off of the
service to focus on their own efforts. And you've seen how we've been doing since 2017, so we're pretty happy about it.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
And then before that, there was EPIX coming off and Discovery, and we just continued to grow throughout that using the money to invest. Like
Our Planet, we commissioned 4 years ago. So there's a lot of planning that goes into this, and that's what makes it exciting.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Well, along those lines, I thought there was a really interesting piece in the shareholder letter that looked at a product that would show users the
top 10 shows that were trending. It seems like it's a beta test in the U.K. Greg, would love to understand what the goal of that beta test is, what it
might do for user engagement, how you think about that as a sort of natural evolution of the product to almost create crowd-sourced content
engagement.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Yes. It's a great example of 1 of 100 tests that we'll do in a given quarter to try and actually make the product experience better. But the core idea
behind this is there's a bunch of our members who really enjoy watching the most popular shows because they enjoy watching the show and then
engaging in the public conversation around the show and all the memes that are shared around. And so the idea here is let's do a good job at

using the product and other public communication channels to basically let our members know what are those most popular shows so they can
watch and then participate in the public conversation. So we're quite bullish on that, and we'll see how it does.
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
And I would only add that it's a -- popularity is a data point that people can use to choose, not the most important one and not the only one, but
we don't want to suppress it if it's helpful to our members.
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
That's exactly right. And I think to Ted's point basically, our members have a broad set of things that they're evaluating what they want to watch
on. And our job is to figure out for any given member what's the information that they're going to find most relevant to make that decision. For
some members, that will be popularity.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Greg, sticking with you. Another point that was raised again in the letter was around distribution deals. What they're doing for the business is both
growing the brand, growing awareness of the service, driving subscriber growth. Can you give us a little granularity on sort of what you see from
these partnerships, what it means for the company longer term and what the landscape even could look like to do additional partnerships over
time?
Gregory K. Peters - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Product Officer
Yes. Again, this is sort of something we've been on a 10-plus-year trajectory on in improving the way that we use partners, in the way that we've
leveraged those other companies out there to make a connection with members. And it started with just putting our application on different
devices. So yes, that was another easy way to find Netflix and then to enjoy the service and go from there. But progressively, we found things like
bill on behalf of where members could pay for Netflix via their mobile operator charge or their Pay-TV charge. That was yet another way to make
it easier to sign up. And then most recently, we have bundled deals where it's sort of the simplest model where you just get Netflix as part of your
Pay-TV offer or your mobile offering. That's a great way for folks to try Netflix very simply. They have easy access to viewing on maybe their set-top
box or their mobile phone and allows us to access a subscriber base that might be a little bit slower in signing up directly with us for Netflix. But I
think it's also -- and while these bundled deals are great, they're performing quite well for us and we want to expand them, it's also I think relevant
to note that as a fraction through all those channels, the total sign-ups we do in any given quarter and any given year, it's still quite small relative
to our organic channel or people signing up with us directly. So we'll see more and more of those, and I think it's nice supplemental channel that
accelerates our growth with that.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Ted, maybe turning to you on the movies front. Obviously, you continue to evolve the strategy on distribution of movies when you think about
some of the things having to go into theaters or thinking about different windows yourself for your movie content, how has that strategy evolved?
What sort of feedback are you getting from the content creation community? What are you seeing from users in how they want to consume the
content and how might that sort of continue to evolve the movie strategy over the medium to long term?
Theodore A. Sarandos - Netflix, Inc. - Chief Content Officer
Well, I think these are all case by case. So -- and a lot of times, I would say that we're always have been for consumer choice. If I had my way, I would
love to have the movies that are on Netflix be available in 2,000 theaters at the same time that they're on Netflix. We just don't control the

programming of those theaters. So when I say that, what I mean is that people want to go out and have a good time and pick a great movie. And
if we're making the great movie, they don't have the opportunity to see it on the screen, they just -- they don't go out. So the opportunity I think
would be for -- to give consumers as much choice as possible. But we can only control that -- what's on Netflix. And we are -- primarily, we're
releasing in theaters and on Netflix day and date, meaning that by the time they've been there on Netflix at the same time they're in the theaters,
we have an opportunity -- we're taking the opportunity to promote the films generate publicity for the films, release them in select theaters a few
weeks early. But in general, we want them to be in theaters and on Netflix at the same time, but we can only control Netflix. And I think what it is,
is -- it has a lot less to do with the room in which people can consume in and all those other things is we have to focus on making great movies.
And then anyone who's involved in the ecosystem of presenting movies and watching movies will have to take notice of those films. So that's what
we're trying to do is just make undeniably great movies with undeniably great filming.
Spencer Wang - Netflix, Inc. - VP of Finance & IR
Eric, we have time for one more question, please.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst
Sure. So Reed, I'd love to end with you with a little bit of a lighthearted question but also one that I think allows you to frame a little bit about where
you come from and where you've gone. I noticed in the press over the last week, a competitor said that Netflix may or may not have a brand, is
what they implied. And I figure you probably disagree with the statement that Netflix doesn't have a brand. So I would love to understand your
vision of sort of where the Netflix brand has come over the last half decade as you've evolved the company and how you think about repositioning
and evolving the brand to stay at the front of the curve of where the industry is going over the next half decade.
Wilmot Reed Hastings - Netflix, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
We're a mix of great innovator that people love us for trying new things. That's both in terms of on-demand and it's creatively with a different series
that we're doing and being really great comfort food where you just want to curl up and enjoy and you know Netflix is going to be great. So it's
that combination of comfort and innovation that's so powerful for us. And when I think of the quarter, just to wrap up, one little time I was not
watching Netflix on Sunday, I was watching Tiger Woods in the PGA like probably half of America, and when I think of those beautiful shots right
down the middle of the fairway, I think about the 6,000 employees at Netflix is in that perfect clean shot, and that's what the quarter was. So
congratulations to everyone on a fantastic Q1 and looking forward to getting the green jacket for the year for this team.

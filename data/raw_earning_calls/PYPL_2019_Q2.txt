EVERCORE ISI SPONSORED MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL WITH 
PAYPAL HOLDING INC. (PYPL)
Moderator: John Rainey
July 25, 2019
1:00 p.m. ET
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the 
Evercore ISI Sponsored Management Conference Call with PayPal Holding 
Inc. 
At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode, and 
later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. To ask a question at 
that time, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to David Togut of Evercore ISI to 
begin. Please go ahead, sir. 
David Togut: Thanks so much, and thanks so much to all of you for joining us for the 
quarterly buy side call with PayPal management. I'm David Togut; I research 
the Payments, Processing and I.T. Services industry for Evercore ISI. 
Please see the Safe Harbor disclosures on PayPal's second quarter 2019 
earnings call relating to any forward-looking statement. 
It's now my pleasure to introduce PayPal management. Delighted to welcome 
CFO, John Rainey; Head of IR, Gabrielle Rabinovitch; and IR, Akila
Moorthy. Thanks so much for carving out the time to be with us today. 
John Rainey: Thanks, David. We're happy to join you and address any questions from 
investors. I'll also point out that joining us from PayPal is our Senior Vice 
President of Finance and Analytics, Erica Gessert. She's going to join us on 
the call as well. 
David Togut: Terrific. Welcome, Erica. John, would you like to start off by making any 
opening remarks? And then, we'll head straight into Q&A?

John Rainey: Sure, David, thank you. So, obviously, I think there's some amount of 
disappointment among the investor community that is shared, along with the 
PayPal management team of having to lower our guidance. And I'm sure we'll 
address some of the specifics of that later. But I don't want that to take away 
from what was, otherwise, a good quarter. We saw 19 percent revenue 
growth, when we adjust for the sale of the credit receivables. We had a record 
number of net new actives over the last 12 months, record operating margin, 
record operating margin expansion, and so on. 
So really pleased about how the business is doing. I think the important thing 
that I would want the investor community to know is that the decline in our 
revenue guidance is entirely related to timing. And we expect to realize the 
entirety of the benefits, related to both pricing, as well as the partnership 
integrations. Certainly part of the decline was related to foreign currency and 
FX, that will kind of move one way or another from one year to the next. 
So – but when you look at the product and pricing-related items, we expect to 
realize the full benefit of that. This is simply a push out in timing. And 
maybe just one more comment on that is we often have to make estimates 
about the level of effort and the complexity of effort, even the amount of 
scope involved in these projects. 
Sometimes they go better than what we think. In this case, it has taken longer. 
We wish that weren't the case. But we felt the prudent thing was to adjust our 
expectations on what revenue would be for the year – reset, and then move 
forward. So I'll stop there, David, and happy to field the questions that you 
have. 
David Togut: Very clear. Thank you, John. So we received a large number of incoming 
investor questions. I'll jump right in. Many of these questions were focused 
on the change in guidance. You talked about three factors on the earnings call 
last night, which drove the reduction in FX neutral revenue growth for this 
year to 14 percent to 15 percent, from 16 percent to 17 percent.

The first one was timing issues related to product integrations. So if we start 
there, are there specific products where you saw delays and with specific 
partners? 
John Rainey: Sure, I will start with this is not an across-the-board problem related to all of 
our product integrations. This happens to be specific to a few larger partners. 
One of which we called out on the call, which is Paymentus. 
As we look at integrating with them and launching bill pay services, we 
realized – and they have as well – that we have additional capabilities that we 
can offer that will actually improve their platform. These were beyond what 
we initially contemplated when we announced and we signed this partnership. 
But they're the right thing to do. They expand the scope, they provide for a 
better customer experience. And we absolutely want to – want to do these 
things but they're going to take longer than what we initially imagined. 
David Togut: Just as a follow up on that, any guidance, with respect to when some of these 
integrations would go live? 
John Rainey: Sure. And so let me – let me explain what else is going on, in cases where it's 
not necessarily just expanded scope. Oftentimes, we are reliant upon the 
timing of the party that we're working with as well and when they want things 
to go live, when they want to roll out experiences. That's part of what we're 
dealing with here, not necessarily in the case of Paymentus, but with some of 
the other partners that we haven't named. And so it's a little bit outside of our 
control. 
But that said, there's nothing about what we've announced that is an indication 
of a change in the relationship or the type of partnership that we intend to 
have with these companies. And so, it's not as if this is a big shift in timing. 
This is simply pushing this out a little bit. 
Our general expectation around all of these is launch at year end. And that 
may be prior to Thanksgiving, it could slip into January. No one has an 
expectation that this slips into the back half of 2020. These are all around the 
year-end time frame.

David Togut: Understood. The second call out you had in your 2019 revenue guidance 
change related to pricing. Taken together, do the pricing changes and new
product implementations with your partners hitting in late 4Q 2019 early 1Q
2020 imply acceleration next year, not only from the 3Q, 4Q 2019 run rate, 
which was a step down from Q1, Q2 of this year, but from what would have 
been the run rate without the guide down for the second half of this year?
In other words, could the growth rate in the first half of 2020 actually be 
considerably higher than what people might have been looking for before the 
second quarter earnings call? 
John Rainey: Well, I guess, it's all relative to what one's expectations were. But all of these 
things take time to ramp. It's not as if when we launch an initiative that we 
receive 100 percent of the benefit on day one. So there is a ramp with that. 
And those require some estimation around how quickly they will do that. 
The other thing to keep in mind is next year is the year that we transition off 
of eBay. So as you think about our medium-term guidance of 17 percent to 18 
percent revenue growth, that's compounded annual growth over a three- to 
five-year period. 
It's going to be higher in some periods; it's going to be lower in other periods. 
But, I think, it'd be reasonable to assume in a year, where we're transitioning 
off of our largest partner, eBay, that is going to be more towards the lower end 
of that range. So that number already has some pressure on it from that. And 
then, we have to see what the rollout is of these new product launches and the 
pricing changes. 
But we'll give an indication when we get to the third quarter call about how 
we're thinking about 2020. It's a little bit early right now. But the main thing 
I would want to impress is that we have every bit of confidence in our 
business that we've had prior to this announcement.
Our business is still performing extremely well, as I talked about some of our 
stats in the second quarter. But even as we look at things that I tend to focus 
on, that I described as leading indicators in our business. So the number of 
net new actives, how engaged those actives are. Those are performing at

exceptional levels. And as we look at the new cohorts that we're bringing on, 
they are more engaged than their prior cohorts. 
So there are a lot of really positive indications about our business. And that's 
before you get to any of the opportunities that we've called out, like with 
Instagram and Facebook and what we're doing around Venmo and reward 
points and things like that. So we've got a lot of conviction in our mediumterm plan.
David Togut: Understood. A lot of key points that I definitely want to expand upon. The 
first, is there anything you've learned about the possible trajectory of eBay 
volume, based on what we've seen in the first half of this year that might 
inform your view of next year? Specifically, what percentage of PYPL
branded volume with eBay do you expect to retain and what the growth of the 
eBay volume itself might be? 
John Rainey: David, there's nothing that I – I've seen, thus far, that's caused us to 
appreciably change our expectations on eBay. But we, obviously, pay close 
attention to what they're doing and particularly around managed payments. 
And one thing that, I think, is noteworthy is that they've had the opportunity to 
launch in two markets this year. Thus far, they've only launched in one – the 
U.S. And, I believe, the indication they gave on their call was that they 
expected to launch Germany, either sometime later this year, maybe early next 
year. 
And so, I think, that points to some of the challenges with going and getting 
licensing in markets, making sure that you can comply with all the regulatory 
rules and do what's required there. 
So this is difficult, and we knew that going in, so we're closely watching it. 
But, look, I expect eBay will get better at this, as they have more experience 
with managed payments too. But these are all things that could influence the 
rate at which eBay moves their volume to managed payments. 
And the other thing to think about too, which is something we're focused on as 
– when we get to the midpoint next year, and eBay has the ability to move 
EVERCORE ISI SPONSORED MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL WITH PAYPAL HOLDING INC. (PYPL)

Page 6
more volume onto their platform, you then get into the shopping season – the 
holiday shopping season towards the tail end of the year. 
And, typically, merchants want to have their experiences tested, locked down, 
ready to go as they get into that that period and not be experimenting with 
new product features, and so forth, so that could impact the timing somewhat 
as well. 
But, again, that – though it's a little bit outside of our control what they do 
there. I will say that we still feel very confident about the amount of business 
that we expect to retain on this, on our branded button. 
eBay noted on their call that in their U.S.-managed payments, that PayPal had 
35 percent share of checkout, which was appreciably lower in their 
unmanaged payments business. I want to speak to that for a second because 
that's really sort of an apples and oranges number. I think it's not 
representative of what we expect in the future. 
So eBay launched their U.S.-managed payments something like nine months 
ago. And they've been ramping that experience with that – those select users 
over that period of time. We were just launched in that experience last month. 
And so the 35 percent number includes a ramp-in period. We also need to 
take into consideration that in those prior eight months to us being launched, 
people were vaulting instruments of their own because PayPal wasn’t an 
option. 
And one of the things that we have in our contract is presentment parity. So 
that's very important to us. So that 35 percent, I think, is – it doesn't represent 
what we expect when this is fully rolled out, and they are adhering to all of the 
requirements that we have in the contract. 
David Togut: Very clear. Just returning for a minute, John, to pricing changes, which was a 
factor you called out last night: which products in particular, are you changing 
pricing on? Are these all going to be upward or downward adjustments? And 
then as a related question, does a pricing change relate to your new policy on 
refunds, and how might merchants be reacting to that?

John Rainey: Sure. So there are a number of different pricing changes that we've – that 
we've considered and some that we will roll out later this year. And the 
pricing goes both directions. 
Some cases, we realized that to be more competitive with the market, we need 
to lower prices. In other cases, we recognize that we're doing a disservice to 
ourselves in terms of the value that we provide our customers, and how we 
price that relative to our customers that are charging more. 
And so, specifically, with respect to the delay in the rollout, we took a step 
back and we realized two things. In the case of one of our pricing 
experiences, the experience that we put our consumers through was inferior to 
what some of our competitors were doing. 
And, certainly, if we're going to raise prices, we don't want to do it on an 
inferior product. We took a step back and we said, "Look, let's approach this 
the right way, and improve what the experience is here." And that requires –
that's a little more complex than what we imagined. And so, there's a delay 
related to that. 
The second thing is that when you start dealing with things like you 
mentioned, refunds – refund pricing as an example. There are other pricing 
elements that, in some ways, tie into that. 
And so, for example, like if a customer is returning an item, and –we’re 
deciding whether we should retain the fixed piece or the variable piece, or 
both pieces of that, there's also an – a pricing element where who bears the 
risk of a changing currency if it's a cross border item that involves a different 
currency? And we need to be better aligned around all of those things to 
make sure that we're providing the right pricing that aligns with the value that 
we're giving those merchants. 
So this was, for us, taking a step back, being a little more measured in our 
approach and making sure that we're being thoughtful, holistically, across the 
entire experience around how we're monetizing them.

David Togut: Understood. And then on the customer service side, investors are asking
about the pace of rollout of new customer experiences, probably tied to pay 
with Venmo monetization, which is an important topic in and of itself. Are 
there any gating factors behind the rollout of new consumer experiences, for 
example, new money movement experiences? And should we expect to see 
some new consumer products in the next, say, six to nine months? 
John Rainey: So there are no gating issues or problems that we're having, in general, with 
the rest of our product development product launches. And, yes, there are a 
number of new experiences that we're intending to roll out.
One that we're pretty excited around is pay with points. As we've announced 
partnerships with many banks, and we're moving towards an experience with 
that customer base, where, when they go to checkout with PayPal, their points 
are a funding mechanism in the checkout channel. And they can use all of 
that or a portion of that, just like you could move between a debit or credit 
card or different financial instruments. 
We think that will be particularly compelling, particularly as we do a better 
job of promoting the ability to earn points as you use PayPal. There's still 
some lack of awareness around our customer base about the ability to do that. 
So, I think, holistically, we can provide a better overall experience there. 
That may be the premise of your question, David, I want to allay any concerns 
that this is some type of insidious issue that is across all of PayPal, that the 
delay that we're talking about is really specific to a couple large integrations 
that we're doing. We're not experiencing any other type of issues with the rest 
of our products. 
David Togut: That's very clear. What impact has Bill Ready's departure had on the rollout of 
new products? And what's the plan to redistribute his responsibilities as he 
transitions out of PayPal? 
John Rainey: Sure. Fortunately for us, Bill had a very deep and talented bench. And many 
of you have had exposure to some of his key lieutenants. But his 
responsibilities were divided among three or four people. We've separated 
merchant and consumer. That was combined before. Merchant is now led by

Arnold Goldberg, whom many of you met at dinners we've had. Consumer is 
led by John Kunze, which is a known name for many of you. And there's a 
talented team around them as well. 
And so I want to be very, very clear on this. We don't expect to miss a beat in 
product development, and what we're doing with consumer experiences, 
because of Bill's departure. Bill was an asset to the organization, and his 
fingerprints are all over PayPal, and Braintree. 
But this was something that had been contemplated for some period of time. 
Dan and Bill decided that this was the right time for Bill to move on to the 
next chapter in his career. And this did not catch us off guard in any way. 
This is a planned transition. And we have the right team to execute on it. 
David Togut: Understood. As a segue into some of the financial metrics. operating leverage
certainly has been a big focus of yours and, definitely, a focus of ours on 
PayPal.
In Q2/19, PYPL expanded operating margin by 190 basis points. Normalizing 
for the credit receivables sale to Synchrony, held for sale accounting impacts 
and acquisitions, operating margin expanded 280 basis points. Is this level of 
margin expansion in Q2 sustainable for the rest of this year and into 2020? 
John Rainey: So let me address that at a high level and get a little more specific with some 
of the numbers. 
The operating margin expansion that we see in our business is absolutely 
sustainable. When you think about the list of things that keeps a senior 
executive up at night at PayPal, operating margin expansion is not one. We 
have clear line of sight how to continue to do that. That said, I think it would 
be premature to assume that we can have the type of operating margin 
expansion that we experienced this quarter, every quarter going forward. And 
let me tell you why. 
I put expenses into three buckets. We have transaction expense, which had a 
four-basis-point improvement, year over year; transaction loss, which had a 
EVERCORE ISI SPONSORED MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL WITH PAYPAL HOLDING INC. (PYPL) 
Moderator: John Rainey
07-25-19/1:00 p.m. ET
Confirmation # 2562228
Page 10
similar improvement year over year; and then all the other non-volume 
expenses.
The progress we have made on the non-volume expenses, we absolutely 
expect to continue. And from one period to the next, look, we may invest 
more in a certain period, to build up for seasonal peaks because of certain 
unique opportunities. 
So we're not going to be a prisoner to having that same type of expansion each 
quarter when we know that maybe we can invest more, and that will be better 
for us longer term. But the business on an average annual basis, absolutely 
should show good strong leverage. 
The other two areas, transaction expense and transaction loss, are part of the 
reason for outsized operating margin expansion this quarter. And let me take 
transaction expense first. The transaction expense we've seen quarter after 
quarter, the effect of changes in mix in our business to consumer behavior, 
and that's kept our transaction expense around that 95 to 98, 99 basis points. 
We had a little better performance this quarter. But that improvement, relative 
to the range that I just described, was specifically due to the fact that we 
realized some of the volume incentives from the networks this quarter. 
Last year, we recognized that in the third quarter. So that's going to create, as 
we move into the third quarter, as we think of financial results there, a little bit 
of pressure, in terms of the year-over-year comps, the fact that we had that in 
the third quarter last year, recognizing the second quarter this year.
On transaction loss, that's one that I'm actually more excited about. Because 
losses sometimes a result of kind of what happens to us, in terms of incoming 
fraud pressure, our ability to manage that. 
The improvement this quarter though was not because of what happened to us, 
it's because of what we did. Very clearly, we've had some improved risk 
management capabilities through enhanced machine learning models. And 
that is primarily the single, biggest driver of that four or five-basis-point 
improvement. Now with all of these risk models and machine learning, if

they take time to calibrate and to get to a point where you can trust on that 
performance quarter after quarter. 
So, I think, again, it's probably premature to assume that we can have this 
level of transaction losses, each quarter going forward, this is going to –
progress will be in fits and starts. We'll tweak this too much in one direction. 
And we might take a step backwards and then there's two steps forward. But, 
I think, longer term, this bodes very well for what our expectations are in 
transaction loss. I think it's going to come through fits and starts over the next 
few quarters. 
David Togut: Understood, very clear. As a related question, regarding the second half of 
this year, your guidance seems to imply about 3 percent organic expense 
growth. First of all, is that correct? And if so, how much is due to cost 
takeout, related to the Synchrony and eBay transitions versus other factors? 
John Rainey: So there is very little, if anything, that's due to eBay, just to address that. We 
still support their business today, from a customer service perspective. They 
still have a very small amount of volume that they've moved to their managed 
payments. So eBay is not necessarily a factor in that number. 
We will benefit beginning – actually the end of June – first full month is July 
from the Synchrony transition, as we no longer have the employees that are 
servicing that portfolio. And that's – that is built into our guidance. 
David Togut: Understood. On the take rate decline, which seemed to be a little bit larger 
than average at 13 basis points in 2Q/19, can you elaborate on how much of 
the take rate decline was, let's say, structural mix shift, i.e. P2P and eBay, 
versus how much might be transitory, for example, somewhat slower growth
from cross border? And then how should we think about take rate going 
forward? 
John Rainey: Sure. So take rate is always one of those things that there are a lot of inputs 
into, and it can distort what's happening to the underlying core trends in the 
business.

Page 12
Similar to previous quarters, the biggest driver of the take rate decline is the 
expansion and growth of P2P, both for PayPal and Venmo. So the 13-basispoint decline, seven basis points of that was related to free P2P. 
Now, we also benefited in the quarter by five basis points related to hedging. 
And that's a decline from the previous quarter of a couple basis points. So if 
you look at what's caused it to decline sequentially, we have a smaller hedge 
benefit in that number this period than we did in previous periods. 
You strip all that out and it's pretty much the same story that we've seen in our 
business. There is some pressure from eBay, there is some pressure from mix
to our business, but not necessarily in a bad way. So I'll give you an example. 
Hyperwallet is one of the acquisitions that we've had over the last year. 
Hyperwallet has a take rate of less than 1 percent. However, an extremely low 
transaction expense as well. So it's a good transaction margin, good unit 
economics there. But if you solely focus on our unit revenue or take rate, just 
given the mix of our business, you see pressure on it like that. 
And so, I use that as a – as an example. Hyperwallet was about a basis point, 
maybe two basis points of impact there, depending upon if you're looking at 
transaction take rate or total take rate, but it does show sort of the effect of 
changes in mix in our business. 
David Togut: I see. And before we leave …
John Rainey: And maybe, David, just …
David Togut: Yes.
John Rainey: … to answer that a little bit differently, I always think a good analog for this 
is, how are we doing on the same-store sales basis? And on a same-store sales 
basis, we're still holding up very strong, as we have in previous quarters. 
David Togut: Very good to hear. Before we leave second quarter financial metrics, just a 
quick return to transaction cost trends that we've seen recently, and maybe

some thoughts about what the appropriate level for transaction losses are 
going forward. 
John Rainey: I think for, right now, I would model it, as you've seen in quarters prior to the 
second quarter. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. Again, I'm 
excited about the new opportunities and capabilities that we have. 
But that high teens, 18 basis points-ish range is, I think, a good way to think 
about it, until we demonstrate that we can repeatedly perform at the level of 
14 basis points that we did or 15 basis points in the quarter. 
We've had experience here with calibrating risk models and the progress here 
occurs in fits and spurts. And so, one quarter does not make a trend, despite 
our excitement about the improvements here. But once we demonstrate that 
we can do that repeatedly for a few quarters in a row, then I think it will be 
time to rethink what that number is on an annual run rate basis.
David Togut: Got it. You touched on customer metrics a little bit earlier. They were very 
strong in the quarter, especially the acceleration in net new active count 
growth to 17% plus compared with 15% in Q1/19. Could you elaborate on 
what some of the biggest drivers were, let's say, behind the Q2 acceleration in 
net new actives growth? 
John Rainey: Yes, I'll start, and then I'll ask Erica to jump in with a little bit of input here. 
The trend, though, has been pretty similar to what we've seen in the past, 
where the single largest contributor to net new active growth has just been 
PayPal core. And specifically, P2P is still a very good acquisition channel 
there. You know, one of the improvements that we've seen, though, also is a 
reduction in churn, which Erica will speak to. 
The second biggest channel would be Venmo. Venmo continues to perform 
very well. We did not give a new customer number in the quarter. But we 
talked about the overall TPV growth that's 70 percent. So we are very pleased 
with what we're seeing there. And again, high levels of engagement.

Beyond that, there's nothing in particular to call out, other than the fact that
India continues to have a larger contribution to this than it has in past years. 
And that's simply because of the growth in that market, organically. 
And, look, to be clear, India is a huge addressable market. But it's also pretty 
fragmented, and a lot of competition there. I think that if you look at why 
digital payments have probably struggled in India – and I've actually – would 
go further than that, just the fact – cash is the predominant form of transacting 
there, even for e-commerce sales. A large percentage of those are cash on 
delivery. 
If you look at the reasons behind that – actually, this is where PayPal's value 
proposition really, really addresses some of the pain points for Indian 
consumers - we're excited about that long term. 
I think the CLV or customer lifetime value that's ascribed to those net new 
actives is lower in India than it is for the rest of our business, because of a 
higher likelihood to churn given their higher competition, all of the factors 
that I mentioned. But we're excited about that long term. We believe that in a 
market that's got over half a billion digital users, that it's definitely a market 
that we need to have a strong position in. 
Erica, do you want to add anything else on the net new actives? 
Erica Gessert: Sure. I think Dan actually mentioned on the call some of the improvements 
that we've been having on the churn front. I would just say there's – as much 
as the acquisition pipeline is extremely strong for us, and actually has a lot 
more new opportunities that we're continuing to look at with partnerships 
globally, in Brazil, and Mexico and other places that we're kind of looking at 
now that we're also really starting to plumb the depths of the – of the 
opportunity with our engagement pipeline.
With any business that acquires as many – as many customers as we do every 
single quarter, you have a certain cohort of customers that is in event – or we 
call them "one and done." They come on and they transact once, and then

they churn off. Some of these reactivate after 13 or 14 months. But any 
business has this layer. 
We've been quite successful in the last year or two in starting to really start to 
engage those customers more actively. And it's actually that cohort – that 
newly activated cohort that's causing us to have a much better year-over-year
churn percentage than we have seen in the past. 
It's really great with Allison Johnson coming on six months ago, and as our 
CMO and really focusing in on how we drive engagement, how we message 
to our customers every single day that the places where they can get value out 
of PayPal, and I think it's really starting to bear fruit. 
John Rainey: Thanks, Erica. 
David Togut: Thanks for that. That's a good segue to pay with Venmo monetization. At the 
end of the first quarter of this year, you had a $300 million annualized revenue 
run rate on pay with Venmo. Can you give us some insight into what that rate 
might be as of the end of the second quarter? 
John Rainey: So we're not disclosing what that rate is right now. It's progressing ahead of 
our expectations. In fact, I would call out Venmo when we look across our 
suite of product initiatives, Venmo is one that stands out as outperforming our 
initial expectations, and that continued into the second quarter. We're
extremely pleased about that. 
I've been asked other questions, David, like, "What is the cadence of reporting 
information on the Venmo?" We provided a lot more in the previous quarters 
because of the rollout of pay with Venmo and the monetization efforts that 
were beginning. 
I think it's probably fair to assume and we'll refine our thinking on this as we 
go forward. But probably every three to four quarters, we'll be updating with 
Venmo numbers, be it customers or annualized revenue, or if there is material 
information to share in the interim that we think is relevant to consumers and 
to investors rather, and can help inform their thesis on this.

David Togut: Appreciate that. As a related question, what percentage of Venmo users in Q2 
engaged in a monetizable transaction? 
John Rainey: Yes. We didn't give that number on the call. But I can kind of give you sort 
of a rough approximation. We did say that 15 million of our customers have 
engaged in a monetizable transaction in the quarter. And while we didn't give 
a new number of customers, we said last quarter was 40 million, so assume 
some marginal growth and you get to around 35 percent or so. 
David Togut: Got it. Thanks for that. It's very helpful. What's the timeline to profitability 
for Pay with Venmo? And if you could elaborate on your thought process 
around how you think about investing for growth in that – in that business 
versus showing margin? 
John Rainey: Sure. So the timeline to profitability – and I want to be a little nuanced with 
my wording here, for just Venmo, in general, not necessarily pay with Venmo. 
But if you take the entire suite of products that we have there is still very 
similar to what it was. 
And we haven't been specific on that. But the way that I would characterize it 
is there are a few stages of getting there in a hyper growth product like that. 
So we started with extreme growth with Venmo and it was kind of like every 
incremental transaction that you have, your losses deepen. And then you get 
to a point where we are now, where we've stopped the rate of losses and we're 
moving towards breakeven. 
And then, thirdly, we get to breakeven. Then last to where it's a big profit 
contributor for us. We have very clear line of sight on how to get to each of 
those. But we're not to breakeven yet, and this is something that I said 
previously, it's not going to happen in the next quarter or two. And that was –
someone inferred that is, "Well, then it's going to happen in three quarters." 
That's not what I meant. I mean, this is something that is further down the 
road. But we have very clear line of sight and convictions that can happen. 
In terms of the investment, David, we feel like we are investing appropriately 
into Venmo. We need to get that experience right. And like I know we've

said that and sometimes investors will be like, "Well, what does that mean? 
What do you mean have the experience right?" 
Well, when you go to check out at a merchant with Venmo, we want to make 
sure that is flawless. If the button is supposed to morph depending upon your 
likelihood to use PayPal versus Venmo as a customer, that needs to happen all 
the time. And that's not the way it is right now. 
You know, this is a pretty significant undertaking on our part, and one that, 
we think, is too precious to not get right. We want to nail this. And we have 
full confidence that when we do that, the P&L will take care of itself. 
David Togut: Understood. PYPL’s top 20 marketplaces TPV growth, ex-eBay was very 
strong, 30 percent-ish in the second quarter. Can you talk about your plan 
with restricted marketplaces that become unrestricted at the end of the 
operating agreement with eBay? And how might you message that as we 
approach July 2020? 
John Rainey: So we're in discussions all the time with all the industry players and people 
that we can partner with that are – we're restricted from today. It's not as if on 
the very next day after eBay, we're going to come out with a swath of 
announcements, like, "Here's all these new partnerships."
All of these agreements take time. And they're specific to what the needs are 
of those marketplaces. But there are ample opportunities and a lot of interest 
being expressed on the parts of those other large marketplaces. 
You know, some more than others, obviously. But the way I would describe 
it is, if you go back to January of '18 when eBay made the announcement of 
moving to managed payments with a different payment provider, there was 
some concern, – certainly warranted, about, "Would we be able to backfill that 
volume from eBay?" At PayPal, right now we know that will happen. We 
want to do many times, in excess of that. And the types of opportunities that 
we're in discussions with and exploring are sizable enough that when we get 
past the operating agreement, I think, this will be a very tired discussion, 
because people will see that if we execute on these opportunities – it could 
even dwarf eBay.

David Togut: Understood. Shifting to capital allocation, can you update us on your 
thoughts, with respect to buyback versus acquisition, especially looking at 
where your stock is trading in the market today versus valuation of 
acquisitions that you might make at current prices? 
John Rainey: Sure. So the guidance that we gave around capital allocation over the long 
term hasn't changed. And that's, specifically, on average, returning 40 percent 
to 50 percent of free cash flow to investors each year, and using about $1 
billion to $3 billion of capital for acquisitions. 
Now that's, on average, over that period. And we are being opportunistic. 
When our stock prices very attractive, and maybe there are not other 
opportunities that are as attractive, you've seen us go out and buy back more 
stock. 
As a side point, in the quarter, we didn't buy back any stock. But that was 
more result of being subject to blackouts because of certain things that we had 
going on. I don't want anyone to read through that as something else. But 
there are also very attractive acquisition opportunities out there as well. 
We've happened to spend a little bit more this year on some more strategic 
investments. 
And let me address that because these were, I would say, more anomalous to 
what we've done, historically, and what we probably will do going forward. 
These are not just investments for investments sake, these were tied to or 
intend to be tied to commercial partnerships with each of these companies –
MELI and Uber, because of the unique opportunity that they are.
And I think they're both very intuitive. I probably don't need to get into great 
detail. But just with MELI alone, you can understand given that we're not as 
strong in Latin America that this holds a lot of promise for us. 
So I put those into a slightly different bucket. It's not just portfolio 
diversification for us. I know investors can do that on their own. They don't 
need PayPal to diversify their portfolio. So that is, to be very clear, not the 
purpose.

I think, going forward, the acquisitions that we make would be more similar to 
what we've done in the past, where these companies are complementary to our 
platform, or allow us to expand in certain regions of the world where we are 
not as strong today. 
David Togut: For example, iZettle? 
John Rainey: I'm sorry?
David Togut: For example, more iZettle-type acquisition, giving you …
John Rainey: Yes, exactly.
David Togut: …omnichannel capability and building out European presence? 
John Rainey: Like that. Yes.
David Togut: Got it. OK. And on that topic, how are iZettle and Hyperwallet are 
performing versus your expectations? And what are the key milestones we
can track on these acquisitions? 
John Rainey: Yes. So they're both performing very well. Simility is also performing well.
Hyperwallet gives us a capability that was mainly sort of a weakness in our 
platform with payouts. And we made that part of the PayPal commerce 
platform that we've launched out to have a holistic suite of services for our 
merchants. And so very, very important to what we're offering to merchants 
today, and it's performing very well. 
iZettle is also performing very well – good, strong growth. Where we 
struggled there is that we've been delayed in implementing that. But that 
hasn't caused iZettle to miss a beat. They have continued to move forward 
with growth and expansion and they're doing very well.
In terms of measuring us, one of the things that you should see going forward 
is our ability to cross sell into iZettle and PayPal. There's a very 
complementary customer base there. And then regions of the world that, 
candidly, I think, have more growth opportunities than maybe of the U.S.,

which tends to be a little more saturated. So, first phase will be executing on 
that cross sell. And you'll hear us talk more about that as we progress next 
year.
David Togut: Understood. Just being respectful of your time, John, I'd like to, if we could, 
perhaps, just close with two questions. 
The first is just one on regulation with PSD2 starting in September. We're 
going to see consumer ACH payments for e-commerce transactions, as well as 
open banking. You know, how do you see the – or assess the opportunity and 
risks to PayPal, especially given your strong European payments franchise? 
John Rainey: So with PSD2 and, specifically, strong customer authentication, SCA, these 
are things that, I believe, were announced back around 2013, 2014. We've 
anticipated this, we are well prepared for this transition. I've heard some 
indication that maybe in certain exceptions the date could get pushed past 
September. We're not relying on that. We'll be ready for that. 
I do understand that with some merchants in some experiences, there have 
been some challenges. But actually I think that's where PayPal can help those 
merchants to deal with those challenges. So we are well prepared for this 
transition. 
David Togut: Understood. Just for a closing question, how will you work with Facebook on 
its Libra project? How do you envision Libra progressing and in what time 
frame? And why won't Libra disrupt PayPal’s business model? 
John Rainey: Sure. Well, very, very early on to have a lot to say on that. I'll point out that 
we have a non-binding letter of intent, along with over 25 other companies for 
Libra. Libra doesn't exist today. So it's very premature to talk about what 
could be here. 
I will say that our interest is aligned with the fact that this is democratizing 
financial services for an underserved population that is very significant around 
the globe. And so, we're very aligned with Facebook on that.

But there are real concerns that we've all heard expressed, particularly around 
the compliance and regulatory impact of this. Those are areas though, that I 
would argue, we are best-in-class. We work in a strong and collaborative 
partnership with global regulators and policymakers. It's absolutely 
foundational to what we do and, I think, very additive, in what we bring to the 
table with Facebook.
We always try to ensure confidence and credibility with regulators and 
communicate in an open, transparent, proactive way. So our position is that 
we think that we can – we can help along this. We don't think it will disrupt 
us. We can actually participate in some of these areas where we have clear 
strengths and areas that don't need to be replicated by others that are 
participating. It's very much part of the partnership strategy that we have. 
David Togut: Understood. John, thanks so much for being so generous with your time and 
insights--greatly appreciated. Thanks as well, Gabrielle, Akila, Erica. And 
thanks to everyone for joining us today on the call, and especially to those

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the 
Evercore ISI Sponsored Management Conference Call with PayPal Holding 
Inc. 
At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode, and 
later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. To ask a question at 
that time, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to David Togut of Evercore ISI to 
begin. Please go ahead, sir. 
David Togut: Thanks so much, and thanks so much to all of you for joining us for the 
quarterly buy side call with PayPal management. I'm David Togut; I research 
the Payments, Processing and I.T. Services industry for Evercore ISI. 
Please see the Safe Harbor disclosures on PayPal's second quarter 2019 
earnings call relating to any forward-looking statement. 
It's now my pleasure to introduce PayPal management. Delighted to welcome 
CFO, John Rainey; Head of IR, Gabrielle Rabinovitch; and IR, Akila
Moorthy. Thanks so much for carving out the time to be with us today. 
John Rainey: Thanks, David. We're happy to join you and address any questions from 
investors. I'll also point out that joining us from PayPal is our Senior Vice 
President of Finance and Analytics, Erica Gessert. She's going to join us on 
the call as well. 
David Togut: Terrific. Welcome, Erica. John, would you like to start off by making any 
opening remarks? And then, we'll head straight into Q&A?

John Rainey: Sure, David, thank you. So, obviously, I think there's some amount of 
disappointment among the investor community that is shared, along with the 
PayPal management team of having to lower our guidance. And I'm sure we'll 
address some of the specifics of that later. But I don't want that to take away 
from what was, otherwise, a good quarter. We saw 19 percent revenue 
growth, when we adjust for the sale of the credit receivables. We had a record 
number of net new actives over the last 12 months, record operating margin, 
record operating margin expansion, and so on. 
So really pleased about how the business is doing. I think the important thing 
that I would want the investor community to know is that the decline in our 
revenue guidance is entirely related to timing. And we expect to realize the 
entirety of the benefits, related to both pricing, as well as the partnership 
integrations. Certainly part of the decline was related to foreign currency and 
FX, that will kind of move one way or another from one year to the next. 
So – but when you look at the product and pricing-related items, we expect to 
realize the full benefit of that. This is simply a push out in timing. And 
maybe just one more comment on that is we often have to make estimates 
about the level of effort and the complexity of effort, even the amount of 
scope involved in these projects. 
Sometimes they go better than what we think. In this case, it has taken longer. 
We wish that weren't the case. But we felt the prudent thing was to adjust our 
expectations on what revenue would be for the year – reset, and then move 
forward. So I'll stop there, David, and happy to field the questions that you 
have. 
David Togut: Very clear. Thank you, John. So we received a large number of incoming 
investor questions. I'll jump right in. Many of these questions were focused 
on the change in guidance. You talked about three factors on the earnings call 
last night, which drove the reduction in FX neutral revenue growth for this 
year to 14 percent to 15 percent, from 16 percent to 17 percent.

The first one was timing issues related to product integrations. So if we start 
there, are there specific products where you saw delays and with specific 
partners? 
John Rainey: Sure, I will start with this is not an across-the-board problem related to all of 
our product integrations. This happens to be specific to a few larger partners. 
One of which we called out on the call, which is Paymentus. 
As we look at integrating with them and launching bill pay services, we 
realized – and they have as well – that we have additional capabilities that we 
can offer that will actually improve their platform. These were beyond what 
we initially contemplated when we announced and we signed this partnership. 
But they're the right thing to do. They expand the scope, they provide for a 
better customer experience. And we absolutely want to – want to do these 
things but they're going to take longer than what we initially imagined. 
David Togut: Just as a follow up on that, any guidance, with respect to when some of these 
integrations would go live? 
John Rainey: Sure. And so let me – let me explain what else is going on, in cases where it's 
not necessarily just expanded scope. Oftentimes, we are reliant upon the 
timing of the party that we're working with as well and when they want things 
to go live, when they want to roll out experiences. That's part of what we're 
dealing with here, not necessarily in the case of Paymentus, but with some of 
the other partners that we haven't named. And so it's a little bit outside of our 
control. 
But that said, there's nothing about what we've announced that is an indication 
of a change in the relationship or the type of partnership that we intend to 
have with these companies. And so, it's not as if this is a big shift in timing. 
This is simply pushing this out a little bit. 
Our general expectation around all of these is launch at year end. And that 
may be prior to Thanksgiving, it could slip into January. No one has an 
expectation that this slips into the back half of 2020. These are all around the 
year-end time frame.

David Togut: Understood. The second call out you had in your 2019 revenue guidance 
change related to pricing. Taken together, do the pricing changes and new
product implementations with your partners hitting in late 4Q 2019 early 1Q
2020 imply acceleration next year, not only from the 3Q, 4Q 2019 run rate, 
which was a step down from Q1, Q2 of this year, but from what would have 
been the run rate without the guide down for the second half of this year?
In other words, could the growth rate in the first half of 2020 actually be 
considerably higher than what people might have been looking for before the 
second quarter earnings call? 
John Rainey: Well, I guess, it's all relative to what one's expectations were. But all of these 
things take time to ramp. It's not as if when we launch an initiative that we 
receive 100 percent of the benefit on day one. So there is a ramp with that. 
And those require some estimation around how quickly they will do that. 
The other thing to keep in mind is next year is the year that we transition off 
of eBay. So as you think about our medium-term guidance of 17 percent to 18 
percent revenue growth, that's compounded annual growth over a three- to 
five-year period. 
It's going to be higher in some periods; it's going to be lower in other periods. 
But, I think, it'd be reasonable to assume in a year, where we're transitioning 
off of our largest partner, eBay, that is going to be more towards the lower end 
of that range. So that number already has some pressure on it from that. And 
then, we have to see what the rollout is of these new product launches and the 
pricing changes. 
But we'll give an indication when we get to the third quarter call about how 
we're thinking about 2020. It's a little bit early right now. But the main thing 
I would want to impress is that we have every bit of confidence in our 
business that we've had prior to this announcement.
Our business is still performing extremely well, as I talked about some of our 
stats in the second quarter. But even as we look at things that I tend to focus 
on, that I described as leading indicators in our business. So the number of 
net new actives, how engaged those actives are. Those are performing at

exceptional levels. And as we look at the new cohorts that we're bringing on, 
they are more engaged than their prior cohorts. 
So there are a lot of really positive indications about our business. And that's 
before you get to any of the opportunities that we've called out, like with 
Instagram and Facebook and what we're doing around Venmo and reward 
points and things like that. So we've got a lot of conviction in our mediumterm plan.
David Togut: Understood. A lot of key points that I definitely want to expand upon. The 
first, is there anything you've learned about the possible trajectory of eBay 
volume, based on what we've seen in the first half of this year that might 
inform your view of next year? Specifically, what percentage of PYPL
branded volume with eBay do you expect to retain and what the growth of the 
eBay volume itself might be? 
John Rainey: David, there's nothing that I – I've seen, thus far, that's caused us to 
appreciably change our expectations on eBay. But we, obviously, pay close 
attention to what they're doing and particularly around managed payments. 
And one thing that, I think, is noteworthy is that they've had the opportunity to 
launch in two markets this year. Thus far, they've only launched in one – the 
U.S. And, I believe, the indication they gave on their call was that they 
expected to launch Germany, either sometime later this year, maybe early next 
year. 
And so, I think, that points to some of the challenges with going and getting 
licensing in markets, making sure that you can comply with all the regulatory 
rules and do what's required there. 
So this is difficult, and we knew that going in, so we're closely watching it. 
But, look, I expect eBay will get better at this, as they have more experience 
with managed payments too. But these are all things that could influence the 
rate at which eBay moves their volume to managed payments. 
And the other thing to think about too, which is something we're focused on as 
– when we get to the midpoint next year, and eBay has the ability to move 
EVERCORE ISI SPONSORED MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL WITH PAYPAL HOLDING INC. (PYPL)

Page 6
more volume onto their platform, you then get into the shopping season – the 
holiday shopping season towards the tail end of the year. 
And, typically, merchants want to have their experiences tested, locked down, 
ready to go as they get into that that period and not be experimenting with 
new product features, and so forth, so that could impact the timing somewhat 
as well. 
But, again, that – though it's a little bit outside of our control what they do 
there. I will say that we still feel very confident about the amount of business 
that we expect to retain on this, on our branded button. 
eBay noted on their call that in their U.S.-managed payments, that PayPal had 
35 percent share of checkout, which was appreciably lower in their 
unmanaged payments business. I want to speak to that for a second because 
that's really sort of an apples and oranges number. I think it's not 
representative of what we expect in the future. 
So eBay launched their U.S.-managed payments something like nine months 
ago. And they've been ramping that experience with that – those select users 
over that period of time. We were just launched in that experience last month. 
And so the 35 percent number includes a ramp-in period. We also need to 
take into consideration that in those prior eight months to us being launched, 
people were vaulting instruments of their own because PayPal wasn’t an 
option. 
And one of the things that we have in our contract is presentment parity. So 
that's very important to us. So that 35 percent, I think, is – it doesn't represent 
what we expect when this is fully rolled out, and they are adhering to all of the 
requirements that we have in the contract. 
David Togut: Very clear. Just returning for a minute, John, to pricing changes, which was a 
factor you called out last night: which products in particular, are you changing 
pricing on? Are these all going to be upward or downward adjustments? And 
then as a related question, does a pricing change relate to your new policy on 
refunds, and how might merchants be reacting to that?

John Rainey: Sure. So there are a number of different pricing changes that we've – that 
we've considered and some that we will roll out later this year. And the 
pricing goes both directions. 
Some cases, we realized that to be more competitive with the market, we need 
to lower prices. In other cases, we recognize that we're doing a disservice to 
ourselves in terms of the value that we provide our customers, and how we 
price that relative to our customers that are charging more. 
And so, specifically, with respect to the delay in the rollout, we took a step 
back and we realized two things. In the case of one of our pricing 
experiences, the experience that we put our consumers through was inferior to 
what some of our competitors were doing. 
And, certainly, if we're going to raise prices, we don't want to do it on an 
inferior product. We took a step back and we said, "Look, let's approach this 
the right way, and improve what the experience is here." And that requires –
that's a little more complex than what we imagined. And so, there's a delay 
related to that. 
The second thing is that when you start dealing with things like you 
mentioned, refunds – refund pricing as an example. There are other pricing 
elements that, in some ways, tie into that. 
And so, for example, like if a customer is returning an item, and –we’re 
deciding whether we should retain the fixed piece or the variable piece, or 
both pieces of that, there's also an – a pricing element where who bears the 
risk of a changing currency if it's a cross border item that involves a different 
currency? And we need to be better aligned around all of those things to 
make sure that we're providing the right pricing that aligns with the value that 
we're giving those merchants. 
So this was, for us, taking a step back, being a little more measured in our 
approach and making sure that we're being thoughtful, holistically, across the 
entire experience around how we're monetizing them.

David Togut: Understood. And then on the customer service side, investors are asking
about the pace of rollout of new customer experiences, probably tied to pay 
with Venmo monetization, which is an important topic in and of itself. Are 
there any gating factors behind the rollout of new consumer experiences, for 
example, new money movement experiences? And should we expect to see 
some new consumer products in the next, say, six to nine months? 
John Rainey: So there are no gating issues or problems that we're having, in general, with 
the rest of our product development product launches. And, yes, there are a 
number of new experiences that we're intending to roll out.
One that we're pretty excited around is pay with points. As we've announced 
partnerships with many banks, and we're moving towards an experience with 
that customer base, where, when they go to checkout with PayPal, their points 
are a funding mechanism in the checkout channel. And they can use all of 
that or a portion of that, just like you could move between a debit or credit 
card or different financial instruments. 
We think that will be particularly compelling, particularly as we do a better 
job of promoting the ability to earn points as you use PayPal. There's still 
some lack of awareness around our customer base about the ability to do that. 
So, I think, holistically, we can provide a better overall experience there. 
That may be the premise of your question, David, I want to allay any concerns 
that this is some type of insidious issue that is across all of PayPal, that the 
delay that we're talking about is really specific to a couple large integrations 
that we're doing. We're not experiencing any other type of issues with the rest 
of our products. 
David Togut: That's very clear. What impact has Bill Ready's departure had on the rollout of 
new products? And what's the plan to redistribute his responsibilities as he 
transitions out of PayPal? 
John Rainey: Sure. Fortunately for us, Bill had a very deep and talented bench. And many 
of you have had exposure to some of his key lieutenants. But his 
responsibilities were divided among three or four people. We've separated 
merchant and consumer. That was combined before. Merchant is now led by

Arnold Goldberg, whom many of you met at dinners we've had. Consumer is 
led by John Kunze, which is a known name for many of you. And there's a 
talented team around them as well. 
And so I want to be very, very clear on this. We don't expect to miss a beat in 
product development, and what we're doing with consumer experiences, 
because of Bill's departure. Bill was an asset to the organization, and his 
fingerprints are all over PayPal, and Braintree. 
But this was something that had been contemplated for some period of time. 
Dan and Bill decided that this was the right time for Bill to move on to the 
next chapter in his career. And this did not catch us off guard in any way. 
This is a planned transition. And we have the right team to execute on it. 
David Togut: Understood. As a segue into some of the financial metrics. operating leverage
certainly has been a big focus of yours and, definitely, a focus of ours on 
PayPal.
In Q2/19, PYPL expanded operating margin by 190 basis points. Normalizing 
for the credit receivables sale to Synchrony, held for sale accounting impacts 
and acquisitions, operating margin expanded 280 basis points. Is this level of 
margin expansion in Q2 sustainable for the rest of this year and into 2020? 
John Rainey: So let me address that at a high level and get a little more specific with some 
of the numbers. 
The operating margin expansion that we see in our business is absolutely 
sustainable. When you think about the list of things that keeps a senior 
executive up at night at PayPal, operating margin expansion is not one. We 
have clear line of sight how to continue to do that. That said, I think it would 
be premature to assume that we can have the type of operating margin 
expansion that we experienced this quarter, every quarter going forward. And 
let me tell you why. 
I put expenses into three buckets. We have transaction expense, which had a 
four-basis-point improvement, year over year; transaction loss, which had a 
EVERCORE ISI SPONSORED MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL WITH PAYPAL HOLDING INC. (PYPL) 
Moderator: John Rainey
07-25-19/1:00 p.m. ET
Confirmation # 2562228
Page 10
similar improvement year over year; and then all the other non-volume 
expenses.
The progress we have made on the non-volume expenses, we absolutely 
expect to continue. And from one period to the next, look, we may invest 
more in a certain period, to build up for seasonal peaks because of certain 
unique opportunities. 
So we're not going to be a prisoner to having that same type of expansion each 
quarter when we know that maybe we can invest more, and that will be better 
for us longer term. But the business on an average annual basis, absolutely 
should show good strong leverage. 
The other two areas, transaction expense and transaction loss, are part of the 
reason for outsized operating margin expansion this quarter. And let me take 
transaction expense first. The transaction expense we've seen quarter after 
quarter, the effect of changes in mix in our business to consumer behavior, 
and that's kept our transaction expense around that 95 to 98, 99 basis points. 
We had a little better performance this quarter. But that improvement, relative 
to the range that I just described, was specifically due to the fact that we 
realized some of the volume incentives from the networks this quarter. 
Last year, we recognized that in the third quarter. So that's going to create, as 
we move into the third quarter, as we think of financial results there, a little bit 
of pressure, in terms of the year-over-year comps, the fact that we had that in 
the third quarter last year, recognizing the second quarter this year.
On transaction loss, that's one that I'm actually more excited about. Because 
losses sometimes a result of kind of what happens to us, in terms of incoming 
fraud pressure, our ability to manage that. 
The improvement this quarter though was not because of what happened to us, 
it's because of what we did. Very clearly, we've had some improved risk 
management capabilities through enhanced machine learning models. And 
that is primarily the single, biggest driver of that four or five-basis-point 
improvement. Now with all of these risk models and machine learning, if

they take time to calibrate and to get to a point where you can trust on that 
performance quarter after quarter. 
So, I think, again, it's probably premature to assume that we can have this 
level of transaction losses, each quarter going forward, this is going to –
progress will be in fits and starts. We'll tweak this too much in one direction. 
And we might take a step backwards and then there's two steps forward. But, 
I think, longer term, this bodes very well for what our expectations are in 
transaction loss. I think it's going to come through fits and starts over the next 
few quarters. 
David Togut: Understood, very clear. As a related question, regarding the second half of 
this year, your guidance seems to imply about 3 percent organic expense 
growth. First of all, is that correct? And if so, how much is due to cost 
takeout, related to the Synchrony and eBay transitions versus other factors? 
John Rainey: So there is very little, if anything, that's due to eBay, just to address that. We 
still support their business today, from a customer service perspective. They 
still have a very small amount of volume that they've moved to their managed 
payments. So eBay is not necessarily a factor in that number. 
We will benefit beginning – actually the end of June – first full month is July 
from the Synchrony transition, as we no longer have the employees that are 
servicing that portfolio. And that's – that is built into our guidance. 
David Togut: Understood. On the take rate decline, which seemed to be a little bit larger 
than average at 13 basis points in 2Q/19, can you elaborate on how much of 
the take rate decline was, let's say, structural mix shift, i.e. P2P and eBay, 
versus how much might be transitory, for example, somewhat slower growth
from cross border? And then how should we think about take rate going 
forward? 
John Rainey: Sure. So take rate is always one of those things that there are a lot of inputs 
into, and it can distort what's happening to the underlying core trends in the 
business.

Page 12
Similar to previous quarters, the biggest driver of the take rate decline is the 
expansion and growth of P2P, both for PayPal and Venmo. So the 13-basispoint decline, seven basis points of that was related to free P2P. 
Now, we also benefited in the quarter by five basis points related to hedging. 
And that's a decline from the previous quarter of a couple basis points. So if 
you look at what's caused it to decline sequentially, we have a smaller hedge 
benefit in that number this period than we did in previous periods. 
You strip all that out and it's pretty much the same story that we've seen in our 
business. There is some pressure from eBay, there is some pressure from mix
to our business, but not necessarily in a bad way. So I'll give you an example. 
Hyperwallet is one of the acquisitions that we've had over the last year. 
Hyperwallet has a take rate of less than 1 percent. However, an extremely low 
transaction expense as well. So it's a good transaction margin, good unit 
economics there. But if you solely focus on our unit revenue or take rate, just 
given the mix of our business, you see pressure on it like that. 
And so, I use that as a – as an example. Hyperwallet was about a basis point, 
maybe two basis points of impact there, depending upon if you're looking at 
transaction take rate or total take rate, but it does show sort of the effect of 
changes in mix in our business. 
David Togut: I see. And before we leave …
John Rainey: And maybe, David, just …
David Togut: Yes.
John Rainey: … to answer that a little bit differently, I always think a good analog for this 
is, how are we doing on the same-store sales basis? And on a same-store sales 
basis, we're still holding up very strong, as we have in previous quarters. 
David Togut: Very good to hear. Before we leave second quarter financial metrics, just a 
quick return to transaction cost trends that we've seen recently, and maybe

some thoughts about what the appropriate level for transaction losses are 
going forward. 
John Rainey: I think for, right now, I would model it, as you've seen in quarters prior to the 
second quarter. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. Again, I'm 
excited about the new opportunities and capabilities that we have. 
But that high teens, 18 basis points-ish range is, I think, a good way to think 
about it, until we demonstrate that we can repeatedly perform at the level of 
14 basis points that we did or 15 basis points in the quarter. 
We've had experience here with calibrating risk models and the progress here 
occurs in fits and spurts. And so, one quarter does not make a trend, despite 
our excitement about the improvements here. But once we demonstrate that 
we can do that repeatedly for a few quarters in a row, then I think it will be 
time to rethink what that number is on an annual run rate basis.
David Togut: Got it. You touched on customer metrics a little bit earlier. They were very 
strong in the quarter, especially the acceleration in net new active count 
growth to 17% plus compared with 15% in Q1/19. Could you elaborate on 
what some of the biggest drivers were, let's say, behind the Q2 acceleration in 
net new actives growth? 
John Rainey: Yes, I'll start, and then I'll ask Erica to jump in with a little bit of input here. 
The trend, though, has been pretty similar to what we've seen in the past, 
where the single largest contributor to net new active growth has just been 
PayPal core. And specifically, P2P is still a very good acquisition channel 
there. You know, one of the improvements that we've seen, though, also is a 
reduction in churn, which Erica will speak to. 
The second biggest channel would be Venmo. Venmo continues to perform 
very well. We did not give a new customer number in the quarter. But we 
talked about the overall TPV growth that's 70 percent. So we are very pleased 
with what we're seeing there. And again, high levels of engagement.

Beyond that, there's nothing in particular to call out, other than the fact that
India continues to have a larger contribution to this than it has in past years. 
And that's simply because of the growth in that market, organically. 
And, look, to be clear, India is a huge addressable market. But it's also pretty 
fragmented, and a lot of competition there. I think that if you look at why 
digital payments have probably struggled in India – and I've actually – would 
go further than that, just the fact – cash is the predominant form of transacting 
there, even for e-commerce sales. A large percentage of those are cash on 
delivery. 
If you look at the reasons behind that – actually, this is where PayPal's value 
proposition really, really addresses some of the pain points for Indian 
consumers - we're excited about that long term. 
I think the CLV or customer lifetime value that's ascribed to those net new 
actives is lower in India than it is for the rest of our business, because of a 
higher likelihood to churn given their higher competition, all of the factors 
that I mentioned. But we're excited about that long term. We believe that in a 
market that's got over half a billion digital users, that it's definitely a market 
that we need to have a strong position in. 
Erica, do you want to add anything else on the net new actives? 
Erica Gessert: Sure. I think Dan actually mentioned on the call some of the improvements 
that we've been having on the churn front. I would just say there's – as much 
as the acquisition pipeline is extremely strong for us, and actually has a lot 
more new opportunities that we're continuing to look at with partnerships 
globally, in Brazil, and Mexico and other places that we're kind of looking at 
now that we're also really starting to plumb the depths of the – of the 
opportunity with our engagement pipeline.
With any business that acquires as many – as many customers as we do every 
single quarter, you have a certain cohort of customers that is in event – or we 
call them "one and done." They come on and they transact once, and then

they churn off. Some of these reactivate after 13 or 14 months. But any 
business has this layer. 
We've been quite successful in the last year or two in starting to really start to 
engage those customers more actively. And it's actually that cohort – that 
newly activated cohort that's causing us to have a much better year-over-year
churn percentage than we have seen in the past. 
It's really great with Allison Johnson coming on six months ago, and as our 
CMO and really focusing in on how we drive engagement, how we message 
to our customers every single day that the places where they can get value out 
of PayPal, and I think it's really starting to bear fruit. 
John Rainey: Thanks, Erica. 
David Togut: Thanks for that. That's a good segue to pay with Venmo monetization. At the 
end of the first quarter of this year, you had a $300 million annualized revenue 
run rate on pay with Venmo. Can you give us some insight into what that rate 
might be as of the end of the second quarter? 
John Rainey: So we're not disclosing what that rate is right now. It's progressing ahead of 
our expectations. In fact, I would call out Venmo when we look across our 
suite of product initiatives, Venmo is one that stands out as outperforming our 
initial expectations, and that continued into the second quarter. We're
extremely pleased about that. 
I've been asked other questions, David, like, "What is the cadence of reporting 
information on the Venmo?" We provided a lot more in the previous quarters 
because of the rollout of pay with Venmo and the monetization efforts that 
were beginning. 
I think it's probably fair to assume and we'll refine our thinking on this as we 
go forward. But probably every three to four quarters, we'll be updating with 
Venmo numbers, be it customers or annualized revenue, or if there is material 
information to share in the interim that we think is relevant to consumers and 
to investors rather, and can help inform their thesis on this.

David Togut: Appreciate that. As a related question, what percentage of Venmo users in Q2 
engaged in a monetizable transaction? 
John Rainey: Yes. We didn't give that number on the call. But I can kind of give you sort 
of a rough approximation. We did say that 15 million of our customers have 
engaged in a monetizable transaction in the quarter. And while we didn't give 
a new number of customers, we said last quarter was 40 million, so assume 
some marginal growth and you get to around 35 percent or so. 
David Togut: Got it. Thanks for that. It's very helpful. What's the timeline to profitability 
for Pay with Venmo? And if you could elaborate on your thought process 
around how you think about investing for growth in that – in that business 
versus showing margin? 
John Rainey: Sure. So the timeline to profitability – and I want to be a little nuanced with 
my wording here, for just Venmo, in general, not necessarily pay with Venmo. 
But if you take the entire suite of products that we have there is still very 
similar to what it was. 
And we haven't been specific on that. But the way that I would characterize it 
is there are a few stages of getting there in a hyper growth product like that. 
So we started with extreme growth with Venmo and it was kind of like every 
incremental transaction that you have, your losses deepen. And then you get 
to a point where we are now, where we've stopped the rate of losses and we're 
moving towards breakeven. 
And then, thirdly, we get to breakeven. Then last to where it's a big profit 
contributor for us. We have very clear line of sight on how to get to each of 
those. But we're not to breakeven yet, and this is something that I said 
previously, it's not going to happen in the next quarter or two. And that was –
someone inferred that is, "Well, then it's going to happen in three quarters." 
That's not what I meant. I mean, this is something that is further down the 
road. But we have very clear line of sight and convictions that can happen. 
In terms of the investment, David, we feel like we are investing appropriately 
into Venmo. We need to get that experience right. And like I know we've

said that and sometimes investors will be like, "Well, what does that mean? 
What do you mean have the experience right?" 
Well, when you go to check out at a merchant with Venmo, we want to make 
sure that is flawless. If the button is supposed to morph depending upon your 
likelihood to use PayPal versus Venmo as a customer, that needs to happen all 
the time. And that's not the way it is right now. 
You know, this is a pretty significant undertaking on our part, and one that, 
we think, is too precious to not get right. We want to nail this. And we have 
full confidence that when we do that, the P&L will take care of itself. 
David Togut: Understood. PYPL’s top 20 marketplaces TPV growth, ex-eBay was very 
strong, 30 percent-ish in the second quarter. Can you talk about your plan 
with restricted marketplaces that become unrestricted at the end of the 
operating agreement with eBay? And how might you message that as we 
approach July 2020? 
John Rainey: So we're in discussions all the time with all the industry players and people 
that we can partner with that are – we're restricted from today. It's not as if on 
the very next day after eBay, we're going to come out with a swath of 
announcements, like, "Here's all these new partnerships."
All of these agreements take time. And they're specific to what the needs are 
of those marketplaces. But there are ample opportunities and a lot of interest 
being expressed on the parts of those other large marketplaces. 
You know, some more than others, obviously. But the way I would describe 
it is, if you go back to January of '18 when eBay made the announcement of 
moving to managed payments with a different payment provider, there was 
some concern, – certainly warranted, about, "Would we be able to backfill that 
volume from eBay?" At PayPal, right now we know that will happen. We 
want to do many times, in excess of that. And the types of opportunities that 
we're in discussions with and exploring are sizable enough that when we get 
past the operating agreement, I think, this will be a very tired discussion, 
because people will see that if we execute on these opportunities – it could 
even dwarf eBay.

David Togut: Understood. Shifting to capital allocation, can you update us on your 
thoughts, with respect to buyback versus acquisition, especially looking at 
where your stock is trading in the market today versus valuation of 
acquisitions that you might make at current prices? 
John Rainey: Sure. So the guidance that we gave around capital allocation over the long 
term hasn't changed. And that's, specifically, on average, returning 40 percent 
to 50 percent of free cash flow to investors each year, and using about $1 
billion to $3 billion of capital for acquisitions. 
Now that's, on average, over that period. And we are being opportunistic. 
When our stock prices very attractive, and maybe there are not other 
opportunities that are as attractive, you've seen us go out and buy back more 
stock. 
As a side point, in the quarter, we didn't buy back any stock. But that was 
more result of being subject to blackouts because of certain things that we had 
going on. I don't want anyone to read through that as something else. But 
there are also very attractive acquisition opportunities out there as well. 
We've happened to spend a little bit more this year on some more strategic 
investments. 
And let me address that because these were, I would say, more anomalous to 
what we've done, historically, and what we probably will do going forward. 
These are not just investments for investments sake, these were tied to or 
intend to be tied to commercial partnerships with each of these companies –
MELI and Uber, because of the unique opportunity that they are.
And I think they're both very intuitive. I probably don't need to get into great 
detail. But just with MELI alone, you can understand given that we're not as 
strong in Latin America that this holds a lot of promise for us. 
So I put those into a slightly different bucket. It's not just portfolio 
diversification for us. I know investors can do that on their own. They don't 
need PayPal to diversify their portfolio. So that is, to be very clear, not the 
purpose.

I think, going forward, the acquisitions that we make would be more similar to 
what we've done in the past, where these companies are complementary to our 
platform, or allow us to expand in certain regions of the world where we are 
not as strong today. 
David Togut: For example, iZettle? 
John Rainey: I'm sorry?
David Togut: For example, more iZettle-type acquisition, giving you …
John Rainey: Yes, exactly.
David Togut: …omnichannel capability and building out European presence? 
John Rainey: Like that. Yes.
David Togut: Got it. OK. And on that topic, how are iZettle and Hyperwallet are 
performing versus your expectations? And what are the key milestones we
can track on these acquisitions? 
John Rainey: Yes. So they're both performing very well. Simility is also performing well.
Hyperwallet gives us a capability that was mainly sort of a weakness in our 
platform with payouts. And we made that part of the PayPal commerce 
platform that we've launched out to have a holistic suite of services for our 
merchants. And so very, very important to what we're offering to merchants 
today, and it's performing very well. 
iZettle is also performing very well – good, strong growth. Where we 
struggled there is that we've been delayed in implementing that. But that 
hasn't caused iZettle to miss a beat. They have continued to move forward 
with growth and expansion and they're doing very well.
In terms of measuring us, one of the things that you should see going forward 
is our ability to cross sell into iZettle and PayPal. There's a very 
complementary customer base there. And then regions of the world that, 
candidly, I think, have more growth opportunities than maybe of the U.S.,

which tends to be a little more saturated. So, first phase will be executing on 
that cross sell. And you'll hear us talk more about that as we progress next 
year.
David Togut: Understood. Just being respectful of your time, John, I'd like to, if we could, 
perhaps, just close with two questions. 
The first is just one on regulation with PSD2 starting in September. We're 
going to see consumer ACH payments for e-commerce transactions, as well as 
open banking. You know, how do you see the – or assess the opportunity and 
risks to PayPal, especially given your strong European payments franchise? 
John Rainey: So with PSD2 and, specifically, strong customer authentication, SCA, these 
are things that, I believe, were announced back around 2013, 2014. We've 
anticipated this, we are well prepared for this transition. I've heard some 
indication that maybe in certain exceptions the date could get pushed past 
September. We're not relying on that. We'll be ready for that. 
I do understand that with some merchants in some experiences, there have 
been some challenges. But actually I think that's where PayPal can help those 
merchants to deal with those challenges. So we are well prepared for this 
transition. 
David Togut: Understood. Just for a closing question, how will you work with Facebook on 
its Libra project? How do you envision Libra progressing and in what time 
frame? And why won't Libra disrupt PayPal’s business model? 
John Rainey: Sure. Well, very, very early on to have a lot to say on that. I'll point out that 
we have a non-binding letter of intent, along with over 25 other companies for 
Libra. Libra doesn't exist today. So it's very premature to talk about what 
could be here. 
I will say that our interest is aligned with the fact that this is democratizing 
financial services for an underserved population that is very significant around 
the globe. And so, we're very aligned with Facebook on that.

But there are real concerns that we've all heard expressed, particularly around 
the compliance and regulatory impact of this. Those are areas though, that I 
would argue, we are best-in-class. We work in a strong and collaborative 
partnership with global regulators and policymakers. It's absolutely 
foundational to what we do and, I think, very additive, in what we bring to the 
table with Facebook.
We always try to ensure confidence and credibility with regulators and 
communicate in an open, transparent, proactive way. So our position is that 
we think that we can – we can help along this. We don't think it will disrupt 
us. We can actually participate in some of these areas where we have clear 
strengths and areas that don't need to be replicated by others that are 
participating. It's very much part of the partnership strategy that we have.

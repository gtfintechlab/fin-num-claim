Question and Answer
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Thanks, Spencer. Thank you all for having me. Great to be with you, and thank you all for all the great
work over the years. It's been great for us to be on this journey with you as shareholders. So with that,
let's just jump right in. Obviously, you were comping a really big Q1 last year with 50 million net adds.
The net adds this quarter came in below your expectations and below the Street's expectations. Any
additional color you can provide on what caused this?
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Nidhi, it's Spence. I guess I'll take this one first. Hopefully, you can see us. It looks like it's a little frozen,
maybe it's just frozen on our end. But look, so in terms of Q1 performance, it really boils down to COVID,
frankly. As you know, the extraordinary events of COVID have had a big impact on the world, continue
to have a big impact on the world. And for us, at a minimum, creates just some short-term kind of
choppiness in some of the business trends that we see in our business.
So in particular, we had this huge pull forward in 2020 in terms of our subscriber additions, nearly 40
million paid net adds in 2020. And we also had a near global shutdown in production, which we've been
ramping safely and at scale through much of last year and into this year but it did push some key title
launches into the back -- kind of the back end of this year.
So the combination of those 2 things does create some noise. It's super hard to obviously kind of forecast
quarterly subscribers in a typical quarter for us and particularly hard in this environment. In fact, on Page
2 of our earnings letter, we show our actuals relative to forecast, which in our guide is our internal forecast
for subscribers. And because it's our forecast, we're going to miss every quarter. It's just a matter of
whether they're bigger or smaller misses.
And you can see, over the past 5 years, our biggest kind of misses to forecast, either up or down, the --
most of those big misses and the biggest are in the past 5 quarters relative to the past 5 years, and that
was these 5 quarters of COVID. So it's just a difficult time to forecast the business.
But the key is the business remains healthy. Our engagement, our viewing per household was up yearover-year in Q1. Our churn was down year-over-year, and the business is still growing. So even at 4
million paid net adds, if you kind of take COVID out and look over the past 2 years, we've grown from
2 years ago at about 150 million members to almost 210 million now. So that's nearly 40% growth and
about just under 20% over an average over each of those 2 years, which is in line with the past couple of
years.
So the business remains healthy, and that's because the long-term drivers, this big transition from linear
to streaming entertainment, and that remains as healthy as ever. But you do see a little kind of noise in
the near term, but a lot of long-term parity.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
That's helpful.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Nidhi, we had those 10 years where we're growing smooth as silk and then just a little wobbly right
now. And of course, we're wondering, "Well, wait a second, are we sure it's not competition?" Because
obviously, there's a lot of new competition. And we really looked through all the data, looking at different
regions where new competitors are launched, are not launched. And we just can't see any difference in
NETFLIX, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 20, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6
our relative growth in those regions, which is what gives us confidence that it's intensely competitive, but
it always has been.
I mean, we've been competing with Amazon Prime for 13 years, with Hulu for 14 years. It's always been
very competitive with linear TV, too. So there's no real change that we can detect in the competitive
environment. It's always been high and remains high.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Well, it's encouraging to hear that your churn was actually down year-over-year, and you did announce
some price increases in Q4 and Q1 in a few markets. So maybe just talk about how well the subscriber
base has sort of absorbed these price increases in the current environment.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Greg, do you want to go first?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. So we're seeing results that are very similar to what we've seen over the last 2 years, which is that
if we wisely invest in great stories and we increase the variety and the diversity and the quality of our
program, which Ted's team is assiduously truck do in every country around the world.
We also invest in better product experiences that make it more delightful and easy to connect with those
stores. We're just delivering more value to our members. And if we do that well, then we can occasionally
go back and ask them to pay a little bit more to keep that positive cycle going.
And so having said that, I just want to reiterate, we think we're still an amazing entertainment value. We
want to remain an incredible value compared to our competitors and the competitive offerings that are out
there broadly. So even as we continue to improve the service, we got that in mind and we want to make
sure that we're accessible to more and more people on the planet through that process.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Great. And Nidhi, the only thing I'd just add to what Greg just said, I agree with all that, is just very
specifically in terms of what we see in the numbers on the churn side. Our churn is actually below preprice change levels already in the U.S. and in most of the markets and where we have adjusted prices and
just some of the newer ones haven't come all the way back down, but they're rapidly getting there.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
That's great. Can you talk a little bit about what you're expecting in terms of subscriber growth as the
world reopens. If there's anything you're seeing in your more open versus less open markets that would
sort of give you a window into this. But how are you thinking about that? And what's sort of baked at your
guidance?
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Well, tragically, Nidhi, many countries have opened and closed over the year, and we've got many
countries right now that are in real crisis. Fortunately, the U.S. is not one of them right now. So we've
got a lot of evidence on that point. And there was the initial surge of COVID, which was quite large in
subscriber growth and viewing.
But since then, every opening and closing, including the U.S. over Christmas really didn't generate any
noticeable material effect. So I don't think there's any material effect we're going to notice about future
NETFLIX, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 20, 2021

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
openings and closings, again, because we've been through in many countries pretty intense surges,
unfortunately.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
And the only thing I'd add, I guess, to Reed's point specific to your question on the Q2 guide, Nidhi, is
related to that, it's very similar to what we saw in Q1 is what's reflected in Q2 in terms of still working
through that pull forward, still working through some of the pushed slate of some of those big titles into
the latter half of the year.
And also, it's a bit of a seasonally soft period for us. So those are all playing into it. But the good news, as
we said, the core underlying metrics are very healthy and there's this clear catalyst to a reacceleration of
growth and towards that back end of the year as those big titles start to launch and strength of slates and
we come out of that pull forward. So feeling good about the long-term trends.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Do you feel like Q1 and Q2 sort of encapsulate the pull forward that you're expecting? I know it's really
hard to forecast when you add 26 million subscribers over the course of 2 quarters last year. But just how
are you thinking about how the second half might shape up with the additional content as well as maybe
some of the pull forward behind us?
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
You guys want me to take it? Go for it Ted.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I'd just say one of the things to keep in mind is that we normally -- what we have to do kind of day in
and day out, week in and week out, year in and year out is deliver programming that our members love
and value. And the shape of that gets determined sometimes 2, 3 years in advance. So you go into these
production cycles, you go into the planning cycles and you've got a pretty smooth release of high-profile
projects and smaller kind of passion projects and all those things.
And what happened, I guess, in the first part of this year is a lot of the projects we had hoped to come out
earlier did get pushed because of the post production delays and the COVID delays in production. And we
think we'll get back to much steadier state in the back half of the year and certainly in Q4, where we've
got the returning seasons of some of our most popular shows like The Witcher and You and Cobra Kai as
well as some big tempo movies that came to market a little slower than we'd hoped, like Red Notes with
The Rock and Ryan Reynolds and Gaga, and Escape From Spiderhead with Chris Hemsworth, big event
content.
Now all that being said, in every quarter of the year, we released more content than we did in the previous
quarter -- in the previous years quarter-by-quarter and in every region is just that I think the shape of
the mix of the content is becoming a little more uncertain. And then the long-term impacts of the COVID
shutdown are also becoming a little more uncertain in that time frame in the first half of this year.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. Well, I'd love to shift to the big picture now that I've beaten you up about the quarter enough. So
you're at over 200 million subscribers around the world. You're 5 years into your original content strategy.
You seem to be coexisting really well with possibly the largest direct competitor you might ever see.
And your self-funding, thank you for that. We did notice. Maybe just talk about, with that backdrop, key
priorities, what's your view in 2021 and really just the next 2 to 3 years as you see them, maybe we can
start with you, Reed.

Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Probably your reference was to Disney, but our largest competitor for TV viewing time is linear TV.
Our second largest is YouTube, which is considerably larger than Netflix in viewing time. And Disney is
considerably smaller, but we're sort of in the middle of the pack. But in terms of what we focus on, it's the
same things that we've always focused on, which is our member satisfaction drives retention and word of
mouth and drives our growth.
So it's -- where can we find the story that you talk about even more that you connect with? Where can we
improve our choosing where the best things are recommended for you? And then ultimately, the content
of can we have stories that are just incredibly compelling? And we're just, quarter-by-quarter, learning
more lessons on each one of those, which is what improves the member satisfaction, which is what really
drives the growth.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
And I'd say one of the things to keep in mind is, over the years, media companies have been really great
at exporting Hollywood content around the world. And I think I'm proud of how we've done that as well.
So it was like Bridgerton with over 100 million starters and movies reaching these enormous audiences all
over the world. But the one thing that we really have done -- really have sharpened our skills on the last
couple of years has been creating content from anywhere in the world and playing it all over the world.
And the great thing about that is those stories that are coming from all over the world, like we saw with
Lupin this year, this quarter, it was our biggest new series on Netflix in the world was Lupin from France.
And the show was not like a watered-down French show. It was a very French show. And what's really
been great about it is as you tell stories from around the world, those -- the more authentically local
they are, the more likely they are to play around the world because people recognize the authenticity of
storytelling.
And that's something that we've been really focused on as well as continuing to offer a very big variety
of content from Hollywood to the world as well. But we've got new seasons of really popular shows from
around the world like Elite in Spain, La Casa de Papel coming up, The Naked Director from Japan, which
has been an enormous hit for us, Gift from Turkey. So our ability to do this around the world at scale and
be able to bring those stories to a big global audience is something that we're really incredibly proud of,
and we'll keep working on over the next couple of years.
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
And I'll pick it up from there. I'm also super excited about that aspect of our business, to find stories from
around the world and connect them with audiences around the world. And a companion piece of that is
making sure that we increasingly are understanding what our members needs and sort of the members
we haven't signed up, consumers' needs generally, in more and more countries. And they all have sort of
unique constraints that they're working through. They have unique expectations from the service. And our
job is to learn more and more and more about what those are and make sure that we are being able to
offer the service in a way that feels natural that feels delightful to them.
Whether that's having the right payment method so that they -- consumers don't have to think about
what hoops they have to jump through to actually sign up and pay for the service, to how we present
the content to them regardless of what country it comes from or what language it's in but present it in
a way that allows them just to get into the story of it and realize the plenty and the amazing diversity of
storytelling that exists across the planet.

Yes. I think it's -- I think everyone's pretty much hit it, Nidhi. I will try to add. I mean I get super excited
about just this giant transition to streaming entertainment. And streaming is -- entertainment, it's the now
and the future. And we talked a little bit in the letter about our business and how it's transitioned over the
last 10-plus years from DVD by mail to streaming from U.S.-only to global and from licensed content to
original production, but what's helped is just our velocity of decision-making. And our focus has served
us well, and there's just -- we're sitting here, we're still less than 10% TV view share even in our biggest
markets.
So there's just this big long runway of growth if we stay focused and keep getting better. And so I just --
I love the opportunity to keep kind of continually getting better, improving our creative excellence, our
operational excellence and just maintaining that speed and velocity even as we get larger as a company.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
And on the IR side, Nidhi, I'd say my main job is to continue to make sure you're happy as well as our
other shareholders, but I think what that means is just making sure that you all understand what we're
doing and why we're doing it from a strategic standpoint.
And my broader finance role is supporting Spence on the finance side just to make sure that we're
allocating capital as wisely as possible and then continue to support Ted and Greg and the other business
units from a finance support standpoint.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. So Ted, I'd love to dig a little bit deeper with you. Film has been a recent success for Netflix, 36
Oscar nominations. Congratulations, that's an incredible feat. So my question is, over the long term, do
you think Netflix can be the primary or dominant way that people consume films? And if so, what does it
take to achieve that?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I don't know about dominant, but I would say it's going to be a continually material way people view films.
This is where the audience is kind of going. And what we find is that we're not really kind of changing the
way we make films for the way people watch film. So they're watching the kind of films they would have
gone out to the theater to see but in many cases, in the convenience of their timetable and in the comfort
of their home, where they can really enjoy a great new film.
And it could be a film of enormous scope certainly competitive to the kind of things you see in the theater.
You mentioned the Oscar success, and that's certainly one flavor of filmmaking that we're super proud of.
Most of -- we had 17 different films with an Oscar nomination this year, which is super incredibly exciting.
But also the fact that we can do these very large-scale action movies that audiences love around the world
at the same level that are being produced for the theater.
So I do think that that's going to continue to be more and more meaningful to viewers as to what
percentage of the films that they see in or out of their home.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
So over the years, you've been really successful at getting a high share of kind of most watched TV
shows, whether I look at IMDb top shows or remote search shows on Google. Do you have to do anything
fundamentally different in film to achieve that same level of kind of high share of zones?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
NETFLIX, INC. FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 20, 2021
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
Yes. It's not dissimilar and that people just have very diverse taste. So you really kind of want to try to
hone in on -- we've always kind of set out to do your favorite film, your favorite show, whoever you are,
wherever you are and whatever mood you're in. So that's why we kind of go at it from so many different
angles. And it's a very unusual thing where you have man sitting next to the Tiger King on the show for
most media companies, but we have very specialized teams that focus on being best-in-class of each of
those things that they do. And that's how I think why we've had those results you're talking about.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And, Nidhi, I think we would say, too, we would need to spend more. So we spend a lot more right now
in series than film. But that will grow as the total budget grows. And then it's also the experience curve.
We've been doing series longer, and we're more dialed in about what goes really big and what hits, and
we're getting their own film. And also on animation, also on kids. Each of these have their own experience
curve that we're progressing down.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Can you share any more details about the Sony deal? What -- I guess more specifically, what is the
rationale for the deal? And what does it get you that your original strategy doesn't achieve for you?
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Yes. Well, what's really exciting about that deal is that we're going to be producing global original films
from Sony's IP library in their development slate for Netflix. That's really an incredible opportunity, access
to IP that we wouldn't otherwise have. And it's part -- it's a big global programming strategy over the next
5 years.
The domestic Pay 1 deal that is also part of that, I think, complements and adds to -- but only for our
domestic subscribers over -- for 5 years. And we do think that that's a great thing, and it complements
our growing output of original film as well. And we've had their output prior in through other deals over
the last several years. And it's been great. They are great films, and people have diverse taste, like I said,
and I think this adds to that, doesn't compete with it.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. Greg, switching gears to pricing. Your price range around the world has really widened over the
years. But the reality is in terms of willingness to pay, there's probably households in the U.S. that are
willing to pay you $50 a month and then in households in India that can't pay you more than $5 a month.
So assuming over the long term that you can sort of match everyone's willingness to pay around the
world, what do you think your revenue distribution will look like across these different price points?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Well, as you point out, our spread has been growing wider and I think that that's part of that story. We're
really trying to find a set of plan types with the right kind of features. And we know folks are -- some
folks have gigantic TVs at home, and some folks are watching on their mobile phones. Some folks are
approaching the service as an individual. Some folks are approaching it as a family. So there's just so
many different needs out there.
And so we're really going to try and match those feature sets at the right price points to that really
wide group of folks. And we know that that inevitably means that we're going to really sort of see an
expansion of that. And an important part of that is making sure that we are continually looking at how do
we broaden accessibility. So how do we bring in price points that are low enough for more and more of the
world's population to be able to access the service to enjoy the kind of amazing stories that that we are
creating.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
You've seen us do that with rolling out the mobile plan, for example, in several countries in Asia. That sort
of we find a good balance of features and price points. We're going to just do more and more of that. But
I think the broad trajectory is the one that you've seen, which is a widening of the breadth of our offerings
and price points associated with them.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Related to that, your investment -- content investment in Asia has ramped up pretty significantly. I think
you announced this quarter $500 million in Korea, 40 new films and series in India. Obviously, Japanese
anime continues to ramp. I'm curious what's sort of giving you the confidence to invest this aggressively in
Asia, particularly in a market like India, which is still below share of global GDP and willingness to pay for
premium content theme is pretty...
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Well, remember, I think it's the -- the product market fit is what we're always looking for. Now we're
programming the service in a way that consumers value it and love it. And it's a bit of trial and error at
the beginning of each of the territories as we've rolled out. I mean we started launching in international
territories with no original programming in local language with local producers. And now we're producing
in most corners of the world.
And I do think our confidence in investment in Korea and India and Japan has been the success of the
investments to date and that it gets us closer and closer to that product market fit that we have in our
more mature markets. So I do think, like -- and what we have seen in our Korean originals and our
Japanese anime is that they play really well around the region as well as in-country and occasionally could
be very, very global in their interest and desire. And the fact that we can bring a global audience to those
creators in each of the territories has been really attractive.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And, Nidhi, we've had enough success in Japan and South Korea for you guys to think about it like
Germany or France. Like, it's a big developed rich market. We've got that wired. India, we're still figuring
things out. And so that investment takes some guts and belief forward-looking. But the other investments
you should think of, just like rich European countries, content exports really well, and we're just getting a
little better every month on it.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And I'd just add to that, you can kind of see that in the numbers, too, Nidhi, even what we released
on the regional numbers. The APAC region was about 1/3 of our member growth this quarter and also still
kind of healthy revenue growth, including average revenue per member.
And that's, in part, because as the -- as we're also -- as we improve the service, as engagement is up, and
churn is down, we can occasionally take price increases, as Greg mentioned. And that happened recently
in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. And I think our members are clearly appreciating the value of what
we're delivering them. So the business is scaling, and scaling well.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Yes. That's helpful. So Reed, is that gut or belief when it comes to kind of these lower ARPU or just the
newer market? Is that -- that eventually, you'll be able to play the kind of low ARPU high-volume strategy?
Or is it over the long term, incomes will rise in these markets, ARPUs will rise and the math will sort of
work?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
I think on that, we're still learning. We've done some pricing experiments in India that Greg can talk
about. And I would say we're still mostly focused on getting a content fit and getting broader content. So
that's why I'd say that one is a more speculative investment than, say, Korea or Japan, which, again, 5
years ago was very speculative when we did those, okay? But we've got off -- we're over the hump on
that. We've got a great match.
And we're still working on India, and it's super exciting. And again, right now, this month, things are
terrible in the COVID spike. But outside of that, we've been really producing a lot of great new content
that's currently shut down.
Greg, do you want to talk about, like, Jio or any of that?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. And maybe a couple of things there. Nidhi, we recognize that -- we don't know a lot yet compared
to how much we're going to learn over the next many, many years. And so our job is to really try and be
innovative and push an experiment. And so whether that is pushing on the actual model in terms of, like,
multi-month or sachet and sort of explore the ranges of that kind of offering.
But then also something that we've seen that is quite successful for us in pretty much all the markets
we serve around the world is leveraging go-to-market partners who have existing relationships with
consumers as a way to expose them to the Netflix service and then have them make it easy to pay.
And of course, the ultimate and easy to pay is it just included the sort of bundled offerings that we've
been doing more and more of, and Jio is a great example of a partner we've been working with there to
really bring the service to a new demographic at a very, very low price associated with low-cost mobile
plans that they're offering as well as home-based IPTV plans. And those have been successful for us as
well.
So it's constantly just trying to push on all those different engines and really figure out what is that right
price point, the right offering and the right way that works for the local members and consumers.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I would just add that India is a tremendous opportunity. And I think Netflix offers a tremendous
opportunity for the creative community to connect with enormous audiences. And it's just, like all great
opportunities, it's a long journey, and it's a challenge. And we think it's worth it. And that's why we're
investing early and trying to stay ahead of it. And I think we'll be able to see those kind of results that
we've seen in other places in the world as we continue to learn more and more and more.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. Well, I'm a big consumer of your Indian content, so keep if coming. Greg, you've started to run
some tests in certain markets, I think maybe just the U.S., on limiting account sharing. Can you talk about
the size of the opportunity here, and why now is kind of the right time to start tightening the screws on
that?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
Yes. First of all, we recognize that our members are in different positions, again, and they have different
needs from us as an entertainment service. And we're really seeking that sort of flexible approach to make
sure that we are providing the plans with the right features and the right price points to meet those broad
set of needs.

So we're going to keep doing that. We're going to keep working on that, working on accessibility across all
of the countries that we serve. But we also want to ensure that while we're doing that, that we're good at
making sure that the people who are using a Netflix account, who are accessing it are the ones that are
authorized to do so.
And that's what this sort of line of testing is about. It's not necessarily a new thing. We've been doing this
for a while. You may see it pop up here and there in different ways, but it's sort of the same framework
that we use. And I think you're familiar with and so much of how we think about continuously improving
the service, which is we iteratively work. We use the tests and the test results to inform and guide how we
proceed and just sort of continually try and make that better and better.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And, Nidhi, we will test many things, but we would never roll something out that feels like turning the
screws, as you said. It's got to feel like it makes sense to consumers that they understand. And Greg has
been doing a lot of great research on kind of how to try variants that harmonize with the way consumers
think about it.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Are there any particular markets where the subscriber or the user to subscriber ratio is particularly high?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
I think different -- every market, every country is different, and so we see different ranges of behavior.
And I think just how people orient themselves to the service is different from country to country. So I
want to -- it's more than just sort of how they think about how maybe they're working the system or so,
probably just how they think about sharing the service with an extended family or people that they love
is a natural part of how they connect with the stories that we're telling. So It's all different around the
planet, and it's different within countries, too, as you might well expect.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
If this were a gap that you could close over the very long term, do you think that there's a bigger revenue
opportunity in getting some people to pay more through limiting account sharing or getting everyone to
pay more your kind of -- like, which is the bigger revenue opportunity over the next, I don't know, 10
years or however long it takes to start closing the gap?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
What I would say is I think the optimal revenue opportunity, optimal business opportunity is trying to
figure out a way to best serve our members and trying to figure out the models, the plan types, the
right price points, the right features that really work for them in a natural way. And that really is what's
informing sort of our investigational exploration.
I would say we don't really know is most of the -- is often the case when we're sort of going down a path
of innovation what the right place to land is our priority. That's why we do this experiments and then we
do the iterative approach. So it's mostly letting that process unfold and letting our members speak to us
about what's really the ideal model for them.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. That makes sense. Spence, pushing gears to you. Now that your balance sheet doesn't keep me up
at night anymore. I can ask a much more fun question, which is, what will you do with all the excess cash?

You've been asked to do a $5 billion buyback, which is great to see. Maybe just talk about the parameters
and the sort of payments of that -- this particular buyback and just how you think about philosophy over
the next couple of years.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Sure, Nidhi. So as we've said in the letter and the last couple of letters now, we think we've turned
the corner. We know we've turned the corner on that cash flow story. So we expect to be about cash flow
breakeven this year and then sustainably free cash flow positive and growing thereafter.
And so -- and we don't intend to build up a bunch of excess cash on the balance sheet. So we will
maintain a debt level, a gross debt level in the $10 billion to $15 billion range. We've paid down about
$500 million in principal in Q1. So we -- our gross debt did come down from the prior quarter. And we
think that share buybacks are a way to return value to shareholders in a way that is responsible steward
of capital, but also maintains a level of balance sheet flexibility for us to continue to be strategic.
Because first and foremost, our #1 priority is to invest strategically into the growth of the business,
but then, of course, return excess cash to our shareholders. So we're still maintaining a goal of about
2 months of revenue is our kind of cash on the balance sheet. And you'll see us ease into that share
buyback program. So it will start this quarter. As I said, I think you'll see us ease into it. And we're
authorized up to $5 billion of share repurchase, and we'll kind of get the program going this year.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. Reed, you've remained incredibly focused over the years. I remember you telling me recently just
the importance of keeping the main thing the main thing, which has obviously led to a lot of success
for Netflix. But when I look forward to the next 10 years, which I realize is a very long time, but if you
continue to be successful adding, call it, 30 million subscribers a year, you'll be at well over 500 million
subscribers in 10 years, which feels like a high level of penetration. So I guess with that backdrop, how
important is it to sort of have a second app versus continuing to let the business mature and focusing on
capital return.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Well, YouTube and Facebook and those properties are multibillion, and the Internet is only growing, so
were we so fortunate to get to those numbers that you referred to, we're going to be super hungry to
double from there going forward, too. So outside of China, I think pay television peaked about 800 million
households. So lots of room -- and that was several years ago that it peaked, lots of room to grow.
So think about it as we do want to expand. So, like, we used to do that thing shipping DVDs and luckily,
we didn't get stuck with that. We didn't define that as the main thing. We defined entertainment as the
main thing. And so then we expanded into -- Ted -- I should say Ted expanded us into original content.
And first, it was original series and then films and then animation and kids and unscripted. And so bit by
bit, we're adding category. So we've got a lot of work to do in terms of different types of entertainment
that we'll continue to do that, a lot of work in terms of global production. So I don't think there will be a
second act in the sense that you mean like an AWS and Amazon shopping.
I bet we end up with one, hopefully, gigantic, hopefully, very defensible profit pool and then continue to
improve the service for our members by doing that by expanding in category. So I wouldn't look for any
big, large secondary pool of profits. There'll be a bunch of supporting pools like consumer products that
can be both profitable and can support the title brands. So that's an obvious one.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
And, Nidhi, we have time for 2 last questions.

Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. So I mean just to follow up on that, people often view gaming as kind of a natural extension or
adjacency for you. That's obviously still within the entertainment category, as you mentioned. In what
ways is that true or untrue? And is there a way to do gaming in sort of the Netflix title? And Spence built
the way in here as we came from that world.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Exactly. In ways, we're kind of in gaming now because we have Bandersnatch and we have some very
basic interactive things. But Spence, and then Greg, maybe talk a little there.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
Well, I'll probably let Greg mostly go. I would just say it kind of ties to what you -- what Reed said. I
mean we've kind of dabbled in it already through some of our interactive programming as well as on the
licensing and merchandising side in consumer products. And we're a business that continues to learn.
And so far, our learning has been -- it's been good learnings. We're happy with how it's played out. And
hopefully, we continue to kind of learn from here. But I don't know, Greg, if you want to add to that?
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
I'll just take one more sort of point at it, which is that, Nidhi, we're in the business of creating these
amazing deep universes and compelling characters and people come to love those universes and they
want to immerse themselves more deeply and get to know the characters better and their back stories
and all that stuff. And so really we're trying to figure out what are all these different ways that we
can increase those points of connection, we can deepen that fandom. And certainly, games is a really
interesting component of that.
So whether it's gamifying some of the linear storytelling we're doing like interactive, Bandersnatch, and
the kids interactive programs, that's been super interesting. We're going to continue working in that
space for sure. We've actually launched games themselves. It's part of our licensing and merchandising
effort, and we're happy with what we've seen so far. And there's no doubt that games are going to be
an important form of entertainment and an important sort of modality to deepen that fan experience. So
we're going to keep going, and we'll continue to learn and figure it out as we go.
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
Great. Well, if we have time for one more. My last question is just, over the last 5 earnings calls, how
many times would you say Ted has used the word zeitgeist?
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Do I use zeitgeist a lot?
Nidhi Gupta
Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC
I only noticed it because I was listening to the previous earnings calls...
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
It's a good word. Nidhi, you've got to admit, it's a good word.

I actually have a real last question which is, of your Oscar-nominated films this year, which did you most
enjoy watching? And I can go first, mine was White Tiger.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
I'm going to diplomatically pass the question to Reed.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
Chicago 7 for me.
Gregory K. Peters
COO & Chief Product Officer
White Tiger for me.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Chicago 7 for me.
Spencer Adam Neumann
Chief Financial Officer
White Tiger for me, too.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
And just so I don't completely -- so I don't completely wimp out, you should take the time and watch a
really beautiful animated short that's Oscar-nominated called, If Anything Happens I Love You. That is
really, I think, a remarkable bit of storytelling in a way that people can really expand the universe of what
they think storytelling could be.
Wilmot Reed Hastings
Co-Founder, Chairman, President & Co-CEO
And Ted, maybe you could wrap us up.
Theodore A. Sarandos
Co-CEO, Chief Content Officer & Director
Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Nidhi, for joining us on for the call and walking us through this. I
know that our -- what we're busy doing. And I know that some folks are on edge today watching the news
and certain pockets of the world like our friends and colleagues in Brazil and India are having a particularly
tough time, know that our hearts and thoughts are with you as well. But thank you. We'll see you next
quarter.

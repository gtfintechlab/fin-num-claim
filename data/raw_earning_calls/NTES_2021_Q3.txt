To add to the enthusiasm, we are also currently working around the clock to expand the game offering to console and mobile platforms.

Commensurate with our extensive growth across our businesses, our capacity to give back has grown as well, enabling us to amplify our ability to help our communities. our resolve toward social responsibility has also been heightened by the immediate need of those who have fallen victim to metro disasters and public health prices.

This concludes William's comments. I will now provide a brief review of our third quarter 2021 financial results.

The year-over-year increase was primarily due to our newly launched games such as Naraka: Bladepoint and Harry Potter: Magic Awakened as well as from existing games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online and Westward Journey Online II.

Net revenues from our mobile games accounted for approximately 69% of the total net revenues from online games services in the third quarter. Youdao's net revenues reached RMB 1.4 billion, up 55% year over year, driven by fast growth of both Youdao's Q3 services as well as increased sales of intelligent learning devices. Of the Q3 total revenues about 25% of that relates to academic subject courses in China's compulsory education system. Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB 4.9 billion for the third quarter of 2021, up 26% year over year mainly due to increased contribution from NetEase cloud music.

Gross profit margin for Youdao was 56.6% compared with 45.9% in the same period of last year. Significant growth was primarily attributable to the improved learning services gross margin due to improved economies of scale and continuous optimization of our faculty compensation structure. Substantial sales growth of the smart learning hardware such as our Youdao Dictionary Pen 3.0 also contributed to these games as this line carries a higher gross margin than other product lines. Gross profit margin for innovative businesses and others was 15.6% compared with 16.8% last year.

The decrease was mainly due to decreased gross profit margin from the games streaming business in CC live streaming.

Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 14.1% compared with 14.7% in the prior quarter.

The third quarter is our seasonally high quarter for R&D as our new campus hires graduate and commenced their career with us. We remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is core to our sustainable future growth.

[Operator instructions] We will now take our question from Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Alex Poon -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

[Foreign language] My question is, first of all, congratulations on very strong results and game pipeline. My question is regarding Harry Potter overseas release schedule. Do we have more specific time line for different regions for release next year. How is the progress of content and localization and community localization, etc.? How do we have a revenue expectation for overseas? How is it compared with China revenue?

Charles Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

Well, thank you, Alex. Let me answer your question directly in English. We have a strong pipeline and Harry Potter is one of them. And right now, we subject to obviously the progress of localization.

We intend to launch harry Potter to some overseas market as early as first half of next year. And given the huge fan base of the Harry Potter IP worldwide and particularly encouraged by the very strong performance of Harry Potter in China, we are hopeful that this game would become a worldwide transition. The publishing right is a commercial arrangement between NetEase Time Warner. For some of the markets, NetEase will be in charge of publishing whereby majority of the overseas market publishing will belong to Time Warner.

We will now take our next question from Alicia Yap from Citi. Please go ahead.

Alicia Yap -- Citi -- Analyst

[Foreign language] My question is related to NetEase cloud music. So how do you see the overall competitive landscape and also the time spend dilution from the shop video platform? Do you worry if the leading show video platform like Doing that could enter more aggressively in the online us content that could actually put some some threat to cloud music over time and also affect the user time spend on cloud music? Thank you.

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign language]

Margaret Shi -- Investor Relations Director

Alicia. So yes, we do observe that at least in short term, short format video or other general video format has taken and some of the user time spent. That not only in music, but also in games in other forms of entertainment. But what's the major difference between music and the video is that music creates a resonance between users.

It creates that immersive experience for users. So video, if you after with on video, you probably don't want to watch it again. But for music, you tend to want to listen to it over and over again if it's a cute of music that you love. For your second question on potential new competitors, new entrants to the market.

Our view is that this is a very open market we will very much welcome others to join and help those independent musicians in China to realize there. Thank you.

We will now take our next question from Natalie Wu from Haitong International. Please go ahead.

Natalie Wu -- Haitong International -- Analyst

Thank you. [Foreign language] So my question is regarding Naraka: Bladepoint. Just want to get an update of the copy based discount revenue contribution versus in game purchase revenue contribution at a point of 6 million copies worldwide? And also for each part, how should we understand the deferral treatment in terms of the revenue recognition? Also, if management can share with us some thoughts on the longevity of this game. That will be great.

Thank you.

Charles Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

OK. actually, in the interest of time, I'll answer that question directly in english. So firstly, on your question on revenue recognition. So both for the comp sales as well as the intact, we adopt the revenue deferral treatment over an expected lifespan.

So this is consistent with our revenue recognition treatment of other PC and mobile games. Obviously, with the games being launched a few months back now the more the gross billings will come more and more from the in-app purchases, which we are very confident that Naraka: Bladepoint just like many of our other NetEase flagship titles will have a very time-proven longevity. We think a combination of stellar Global sales record for copies as well as our longevity through operations through content update. This will create a unique model for the global PC games in terms of proving the longevity and sustainability of the gross billion over the longer term.

Hopefully, that answers your question. 

Natalie Wu -- Haitong International -- Analyst

Yes, very clear. Thank you, Charles.

We will now take our next question from Kenneth Fong from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Kenneth Fong -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

[Foreign language] Thank you management for taking my question. I have a question on NetEase cloud music. Note that we have obtained the copyright authorization from Employer entertainment recently and also the big 3. So how should we think about the pace of signing up new copyrights and impact and benefit on our content cost and the margin going forward?

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign language]

Margaret Shi -- Investor Relations Director

Over the Last few years, the messages in China has not been perfect, which is why the industry players in music industry has been paying a much more expensive price to the label companies than anywhere else in the world, as everybody has seen on July 24, the authorities have gave guidelines to certain companies, asked them to give up exclusive rights. So I think overall, we would like to see is that we'd like to see to be able to pay a fair price to the labor companies across the world. And we are confident under the right direction. from authorities, the Chinese China music industry will continue to converge into -- in the same -- in the right direction.

And secondly, we think that every music company in China should really be focusing on helping independent musicians to create good music, to create to relay positive messages. As a socially responsible company, NetEase cloud music having making those preparation and that is our agenda and that is our goal. Thank you.

Kenneth Fong -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

We will now take our next question from Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst

[Foreign language] My questions and congratulations on a very strong set of results. My question is about our M&A strategies as well as the use of cash. in addition, can management share about the course in terms of the trend in operating expenses?

Charles Yang -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Thomas. I'll answer your question directly in English. So firstly, for our M&A strategy, NetEase has always been a very -- we are always very focused in our core pillars of businesses: Games, online music, online education, private label brand, Yanxuan. So our business development will be concentrated in our major verticals.

And we obviously prefer and for the past two decades or so, we've been growing organically. But we also remain highly active to explore opportunistic opportunities to deploy M&A to further supplement our growth. So that's always been our consistent approach toward M&A. In terms of the cash proceeds used, again, we invest most of the cash into ourselves into our talent acquisition and retention into our content creation and it takes patience and it takes commitment.

For instance, a major title of next blockbuster game can easily take a few years with big budgets to develop. I think this is also one of our competitive edge that as a major game a powerhouse that we can afford and we can be determined to focus on what we are really good at and what we really want to create. opex trend is, I think NetEase has been listed for over 21 years and we've always had a very consistent approach into expense management. We focus greatly ROI return given our strong cash balance sheet, we are not shy to spend money.

However, we never burn cash for the sake of spending money whenever we spend money in terms of selling marketing into R&D, it is ultimately ROI driven that we want to make sure that the money we spend today may not necessarily give us the topline return within the same quarter, but we will be handsomely rewarded. As such, we expect that we maintain a prudent yet healthy level of selling marketing on the R&D front. We are committed to spend more. That is also encouraged by the authorities.

And I think that is also what a long-term sustainable technology company should do. Thomas, that's the answer to your question.

Thomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thank you and congratulations on a strong quarter again.

Will now take our next question from Eddie Leung from Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Eddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

[Foreign language] I should do the translation myself. I have a follow-up question on your pipeline for the overseas game market. We understand that a good game should be public across different regions, but there are also cultural and regulatory differences. So just wondering besides working with overseas studios, if your Chinese studios will also be involved in game projects defined specifically for the overseas markets?

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign language]

Margaret Shi -- Investor Relations Director

This answer comes from Jon. So our China-based team, their main focus is on the Chinese themed games that they know well for the Chinese-speaking countries, But secondly, we also -- we have been putting a lot of energy and resources in games that targeted for the global launch. So for those games, we think about gameplay, the world view and all the details in a global manner. And for those types of games is typically joint developed by our China-based team and some of our overseas games, for example, Montreal.

And certainly, we also the -- certainly, we also have games that have been developed solely by the overseas team. who will be working on games that buy them and have targeted in the markets that they know the most well in. So altogether, we hope to introduce to the global audience, more and more exciting games to play. Thank you.

We will now take our next question from Jialong Shi from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.

Jialong Shi -- Nomura Securities -- Analyst

[Foreign language] So my question is about Metaverse, which is a very hot new area this day. A lot of companies are planning to invest heavily in this this field. Can management share with us your vision on Medalist and what are the potential growth opportunities it may bring to the online gaming industry? And what are your strategies to tap this opportunity?

William Ding -- Chief Executive Officer

[Foreign language]

Margaret Shi -- Investor Relations Director

Metaverse is indeed the new buzz word everywhere today. But -- but on the other hand, I think nobody has actually had first-time experience in what it is. But at NetEase, we are technologically ready. We know how to accumulate the relevant know-how, the relevant skill sets when that day comes.

So I think when that they eventually comes, we'll probably be one of the fastest runner in the metaverse space.

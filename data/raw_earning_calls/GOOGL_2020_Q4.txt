Alphabet Q4 2020 Earnings Call
February 2, 2021
Candice (Operator): Welcome everyone and thank you for standing by for the Alphabet fourth
quarter 2020 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a
question during this session, you will need to press star, one on your touch tone telephone. If
you require any further assistance, please press star, zero. I would now like to hand the
conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and
welcome to Alphabet’s fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar
Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the
statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance,
including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered
forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors
discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Additional information will also be
set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2020. During this
call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of
non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is
distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at
abc.xyz/investor. And now I’ll turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon everyone.
2020 was a year unlike any other. We are proud that people continue to choose Google’s
products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times. Being helpful to
people in moments big and small is the foundation of everything we do. The past year also
accelerated the shift to cloud, and adoption of online services. This has profound implications
for all companies and consumers, and we’re pleased that so many trust us to help them make
this transition. In particular, Google’s products and support have been a lifeline for millions of
small and medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic.
Today I’ll review some of the important work we’ve done this quarter across Google and
Alphabet, with a particular focus on our growing Cloud business, which we are breaking out as a
separate segment for the first time. Then I’ll welcome to the call Google’s Chief Business
Officer, Philipp Schindler, who many of you know from investor conferences and events. Philipp
will speak about partnerships, business and advertising trends in the Google Services segment.
We’ve heard you’d appreciate more texture and detail here. Then Ruth will go through the
quarter in more detail.
First, some highlights at Google. Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features
and products to help people and businesses. Now we are helping with the complex challenge of
getting vaccines to billions of people around the world. Vaccination locations have started to roll
1
out in Google Search and Maps. Google Cloud’s Intelligent Vaccine Impact Platform is helping
authorities improve vaccine distribution and forecasting. We’re providing substantial new ad
grants to the CDC, the World Health Organization and others to promote vaccine education.
We’re also making direct grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in
vaccination access, plus opening up Google’s facilities as vaccination clinics as needed.
Elsewhere. In Maps, we added a new community feed in the Explore tab. And now you can
track takeout and delivery orders when you book or order from Google Maps. At YouTube,
we’re building products to help creators benefit from two important trends: live video and
short-form video. More than half a million channels live streamed on YouTube for the first time in
2020, from artists performing in their living rooms to churches moving their services online. And
videos in our new Shorts player are receiving 3.5 billion daily views. We’re looking forward to
expanding Shorts to more countries this year.
Philipp will dive into the work to support online commerce and our partners, but I want to call out
our News Showcase product. It’s a $1 billion dollar investment in partnerships with news
publishers, and I’m really excited about our progress here. We’ve now signed agreements with
nearly 450 publications - the majority of which are local and regional - across a dozen countries
including France, Germany, UK, and Brazil. And last month we announced a new global deal
with Reuters, as well as an agreement with one of the major French publishing associations, to
open access to News Showcase. We want to do more partnerships, in more countries, and will
have more to announce in the weeks to come.
Among other highlights, we also launched our reimagined Google Pay app, making it easier to
organize finances and save money. It’s now used by over 150 million people in 30 countries. In
hardware, we recently closed our acquisition of Fitbit which will improve our product pipeline,
and help make health and wellness accessible to more people. To all the Fitbit employees -
welcome to Google! We have a great portfolio of products and I look forward to sharing more
about our product plans.
Now, a closer look at Google Cloud. I am very pleased with the progress here, and as Ruth will
mention, we will continue making disciplined investments to scale the business and improve
profitability. Google Cloud delivered revenue growth of 47% year-over-year – with GCP growth
remaining meaningfully above the growth rate for Cloud overall. In addition, our backlog grew to
nearly $30 billion – up from $19 billion in Q3 – nearly all attributable to Cloud. We continue to
invest strongly in the business given the momentum we are seeing. These investments in our
go-to-market organization have helped us win larger deals, including several billion dollar deals
in 2020. Deals over $250 million more than tripled in the same period.
We are also seeing strong growth through our broad network of partners, with our channel
partner ecosystem growing more than five times and indirect channel revenue more than
doubling in the past two years. Our industry leading customer satisfaction, as identified in a
recent report from IDC, is helping us drive significant expansion and net revenue retention with
existing customers. Our products are mature and highly differentiated in many segments.
In Infrastructure Cloud, our leadership in multi-cloud and cybersecurity helped us win large data
center and IT transformation deals with customers like Highmark Health and Vodafone, as well
as Cloud Native leaders including Wayfair and Etsy. Our leading Data and Analytics Cloud
2
provides new customers such as Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine in healthcare,
and Mercado Libre in retail, with the ability to analyze any data in real time across any cloud.
Our industry solutions, based on our AI/ML expertise, have helped us win customers like Optus
in Communications, and OTTO Group in retail. I am also particularly excited to see us winning
large transformations by bringing the entire breadth of Google’s technology to customers.
Yesterday we announced our multi-year partnership with Ford, which is using Google Cloud,
Android, and other Google apps and services to transform their business.
Google Workspace, the industry’s only Cloud native communication and collaboration solution,
is helping companies meet their evolving hybrid workplace needs. Workspace is driving
innovation at many of the fastest growing companies. Additionally, this quarter we expanded our
partnership with SAP. They will extend their usage of Google Cloud for their cloud solutions,
including SAP Business Technology Platform, to provide the best experience for our joint
customers.
Across the Alphabet portfolio, our investments in AI continue to drive progress. For example,
DeepMind's AI-powered protein folding breakthrough will enable researchers to tackle new and
difficult problems, from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability. Google’s partnership
with Mayo Clinic is developing AI systems that can help plan radiotherapy treatment. Waymo is
now providing hundreds of fully autonomous rides per week, and recently partnered with
Daimler Trucks to develop fully autonomous trucks.
To wrap up, last year I talked about our four big themes of helpfulness, trust, execution, and
sustainable value. These will continue to guide our strategic focus across the company in 2021
and beyond, as we continue to advance our core information mission in products like Search,
Maps and YouTube, keep people’s information safe and secure, drive substantial
advancements in AI over the next three years, and ensure we’re the most effective place to
work beyond COVID, all supported by sustainable long-term businesses.
I want to thank our teams across Google and Alphabet for all of their work this quarter and
throughout all of 2020. 2021 gives us another chance to be helpful to people, businesses, and
communities. While there is hard work ahead, I am profoundly optimistic about what we’ll
accomplish together. With that, I’ll turn it over to Philipp.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar and good afternoon, everyone.
It’s great to be joining you today. We are pleased with Google Services revenues of $52.9
billion in the fourth quarter, which continued the significant rebound from the negative impact of
COVID earlier in the year. Two trends drove the strong results across Search, YouTube and
Network advertising. Consumers continued to move more of their activity online and advertisers
responded to this shift in consumer behavior by reactivating spend that they had paused earlier
in the crisis. In the fourth quarter, retail was the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of
our Ads business. Tech, media and entertainment, and CPG were also strong contributors.
The trajectory of search advertising over the past year demonstrates its responsiveness to
consumer interests and needs, and how marketers can quickly adjust their spending as
circumstances change to focus on generating ROI for their businesses. In YouTube, direct
response had substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire year, including the fourth
3
quarter. After a substantial pullback at the outset of the pandemic, brand spending began to
recover in the third quarter. Marketers realized that even if there was a pullback in consumer
demand in the short-term, they needed to keep their brands in front of people to stay
top-of-mind when spending picked back up. In the fourth quarter, we saw significant
acceleration of brand spending on YouTube. Network revenues in the fourth quarter benefited
from the same uplift in spend by advertisers, particularly in AdMob and Ad Manager. Google
Other Revenues were driven by growth in YouTube’s non-advertising revenues, primarily from
subscriptions, as well as by Google Play revenue growth.
I now want to step back from the results of the quarter and quickly reflect on the generational
shift to digital we’ve seen over the past year and what that means for our business. First,
dramatic changes to consumer behavior have fundamentally changed the way companies are
doing business across many industries and geographies. Lufthansa, or in German, Lufthansa,
is a great example. Like many airlines, they needed more insight on where to fly, at what
capacity and how often as travel started to open up last year. Over the summer, we built a
product called Flight Demand Explorer which gave real-time answers to these questions,
helping them find demand and ramp up. Within two months, they tripled destination routes and
got more than 80 planes back in the air - with many flights fully sold out within days.
We’re putting real-time insights into the hands of businesses in other verticals. In fact, we just
launched a new Insights Page to give our advertisers the latest on ever-changing search trends
relevant to their business, right inside of Google Ads. Petco is another great example - as
people adopted an unprecedented number of pets during shelter-in-place, it led to a spike in
demand for pet supplies, and Petco saw their curbside pickup services go through the roof. So
they accelerated delivery and pickup options using Search, Shopping and Local inventory ads
and were able to drive a 100% increase in their ecommerce business.
And, this is important. Multi-touch points – like curbside pickup and pickup in store – are in high
demand and here to stay. We've seen huge year-on-year jumps in searches for "available near
me" and “curbside pickup.” Retailers offering multi-touch are benefiting from this trend and this
offering sits squarely in our core capabilities with Maps and Search. Let me tell you about
L’Oreal. They did a great job adapting to changes in shopping behavior by making a sharp pivot
to ecommerce and to TrueView. By making existing video creatives more timely and actionable,
their Kiehl's US brand drove record visits to their site from YouTube - 4x more per dollar.
They’re also partnering with us to bring AR experiences for their cosmetics across Google
surfaces including YouTube and Search. I could go on and on. Companies are rapidly adapting.
Next, I’d like to talk about how we are evolving our commerce strategy. We’ve taken significant
steps to accelerate an open ecosystem for online retail that benefits businesses of all sizes,
from large online household names to your neighborhood store just around the corner. We’ve
long said that we want to make Google the best place for users to start their shopping journeys,
regardless of where those journeys end. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth rate in
retail searches was more than 3 times the rate we had seen in the same period last year, driven
in part by COVID.
We also want to make Google the best place for merchants to connect with users, regardless of
whether the transaction happens on our platform or theirs. Over the last 12 months, we grew
our merchant community over 80%, with significant growth in small and medium-sized
4
businesses. All of these merchants and their inventory will show up across Google, including
Search, Image Search and YouTube.
I want to close by talking about something that has been a principle of Google’s since our
founding. We’ve always believed that the future of Google and the future of our partners are
fundamentally linked. In fact, we built our business on revenue share models that support a
broad range of partners, including large and small online publishers; individual YouTube
creators broadcasting from their homes and global music labels; as well as Google Play
developers of all sizes. We only succeed when our customers and partners succeed.
One number I think is worthwhile highlighting in this context. Over the past three years, we paid
out nearly $140 billion to our partners – from Google Play developers and publisher partners
using our advertising services, to YouTube creators, artists and media organizations around the
world. Our performance is only possible because of our customers and partners. I want to thank
them for their partnership, collaboration and feedback. I also want to thank our product,
partnership, sales and many support teams for their tremendous work, innovating to help our
users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these difficult times. I’ll now hand
off the call to Ruth.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our
exceptional fourth quarter performance, after an unprecedented year. For 2020, Total Alphabet
Revenues were $183 billion, up 13% year-on-year, or up 14% in constant currency. With our
new segment disclosures this quarter, I’ll start with quarterly results at the Alphabet level,
followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. My focus will be on year-on-year
comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise.
For the fourth quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $56.9 billion, up 23%, which reflect
broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube within Google Services,
as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our Total Cost of Revenues was $26.1 billion, up
24%, primarily driven by Other Cost of Revenues which was $15.6 billion, and up 25%. The
biggest factors here were, first - content acquisition costs - primarily driven by costs for
YouTube’s advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and
second - costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation.
Operating expenses were $15.2 billion, down 4%. The year-on-year decline reflects the lapping
of valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets in the fourth quarter of 2019,
primarily in R&D, as well as the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID.
Each of the three components of opex also reflects our decision to slow headcount growth
beginning late in the first quarter. Headcount was up 3,180 from the third quarter. Again, the
majority of new hires were engineers and product managers, with continued aggressive
investment in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating Income was $15.7 billion, up 69% and our operating margin in the quarter was 28%.
Other Income & Expense was $3.0 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value
of investments in equity securities. Net Income was $15.2 billion. Operating Cash Flow was
$22.7 billion, with Free Cash Flow of $17.2 billion in the quarter and $43 billion for the full year
2020. We ended the fourth quarter with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me
now turn to our segment financial results.
5
Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services Revenues were $52.9 billion,
up 22%. Each component of our advertising revenues reflects the return of advertiser spend in
response to the continued movement of consumer activity online that Philipp spoke about,
including Google search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 17%.
YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion, up 46%, driven by a rebound not only in brand
advertising, but also ongoing strength in direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.4
billion, up 23%.
Other Revenues were $6.7 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube
non-advertising and Play revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the fourth quarter continued to
benefit from elevated levels of engagement, reflecting increases in active buyers and spend per
buyer due to COVID; however, we did experience a deceleration in growth from the levels we
saw in the third quarter. Google Services operating income was $19.1 billion, up 41%, and the
operating margin was 36%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were
$3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up 47%. GCP’s revenue growth rate was again meaningfully
above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in
both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.2 billion,
essentially flat versus last year.
As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2020, revenues were $657 million, primarily generated by
Fiber and Verily, and reflect that most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue. The operating loss
was $4.5 billion for the full year 2020 versus an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2019.
Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google
Services, we’re encouraged by the increase in consumer online activity and the return of
advertiser spend, as reflected in our Q4 results. Looking forward to 2021, year-over-year
quarterly comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year – with
easier comps in the first half, especially in Q2, and then lapping stronger performance in the
second half. With respect to Other Revenues, with the closing of the Fitbit acquisition earlier this
[sic] [last] month, we will be reporting its revenues within Google Other.
In terms of investment levels within Google Services, late in the first quarter of 2020, as a result
of COVID, we made what we described as ‘tactical’ adjustments to slow the pace of spend in
certain categories. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, we maintained
the discipline through the rest of 2020. Looking forward, we do expect the pace of investment to
increase to support the extraordinary opportunities we see given the usefulness of our products
and services in this environment. The investment pace will ramp up over the course of the year.
As for Google Cloud, we’ve obviously been investing aggressively, given the substantial
market opportunity we see. Under Thomas Kurian’s leadership, we’ve further accelerated
investment to strengthen the position of the business. For example, we are on track to meet
our near-term goal of tripling the size of the Cloud direct sales force and have greatly
expanded the partner channel. We’ve also substantially improved our product offering, while
rationalizing our approach to focus on our six key industry verticals. And we’ve invested in
6
expanding our network of locations for compute capacity to support Cloud, ending 2020
serving customers in 24 regions and 73 zones.
We’re encouraged by the momentum in the growth of revenue and customer wins. We more
than doubled revenues over the last two years, from $5.8 billion in 2018 to $13.1 billion in 2020.
Our backlog, which is nearly all attributable to Cloud, nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020. Although
increases in backlog do not directly correlate to revenue trends, the growth in backlog
demonstrates the success Google Cloud is having with large enterprises which are signing
meaningful long-term commitment agreements.
Looking forward, we will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by ongoing investment in
products and the go-to-market organization. Cloud’s operating loss reflects that we have
meaningfully built out our organization ahead of revenues, as we’ve discussed in prior quarters,
with respect to the substantial investments in our go-to-market organization as well as
engineering and technical infrastructure. Operating loss and operating margin will benefit from
increased scale over time. In addition, we are focused on delivering on efficiency efforts across
the board to contribute incrementally to profitability over time. Finally, as you can see from the
historical data provided in the press release, Cloud’s operating loss was higher in the first
quarter relative to other quarters and then the operating loss improves thereafter. We expect
similar seasonality in 2021.
In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation
opportunity. On headcount, we plan to reaccelerate the pace of hiring in Google Services in line
with our opportunities. Our headcount growth will also reflect the addition of Fitbit and our
ongoing transition of certain customer support roles from third party vendors to Google’s
in-house operations centers. We also plan to continue to prioritize investment in both sales and
technical roles for Google Cloud.
Turning to CapEx at the consolidated level, the year-on-year results this quarter again reflect
the slower pace throughout 2020 of investment in office facilities. Within technical infrastructure,
servers continued to be the largest driver of investment in the fourth quarter, followed by data
centers. Looking ahead, we expect a return to a more normalized pace of ground up
construction and fitout of office facilities which translates into a sizable increase in CapEx in
2021. Servers will continue to be the largest driver of spend on technical infrastructure.
Finally, a housekeeping point. As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the
estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect
these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for
assets as of year-end 2020. We look forward to the year ahead. Hope everyone stays safe.
Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star,
then one on your touch tone telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound
key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your
question has been stated. And our question first comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line
is now open.
Eric Sheridan (UBS): Thank you so much for taking the question. And I hope everyone is safe
7
and well on the team there, as well. Maybe I'll try first on Cloud. I don't know if it's better to
Sundar or to Ruth. But can you just conceptually help us understand how to think about the
opportunity you’re skating after versus Cloud and how it factors back into what you want to
invest against the opportunity or possibly, maybe even accelerate the opportunity by looking at
inorganic paths to growing scale vis-à-vis competition in the space. And then maybe for Philipp,
if I can. YouTube continues to evolve as a platform; there's now subscription offerings, you
highlighted the strength you're seeing in DR. Can you talk a little bit about the path for
monetization in the coming years and how we should think about the opportunity against the
large-scaled audience and engagement you see at YouTube broadly? Thank you so much.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On Cloud, obviously we see how early customers
are in this shift. We see the large TAM ahead and definitely the market dynamics. And our
momentum in the context of the market is what is the framework with which we are thinking
about – the scale of investments and the pace of investments. Obviously, it's an area in which,
the longer you are in – the cohorts add up and so contributes more and the economies of scale
starts working as well. But we are definitely investing ahead to make – making sure we are able
to serve the customers globally across all the offerings they're interested in. And that's how we
are thinking about it. Ruth, not sure you want to add more?
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: I think that's the main point, just given the sheer
scale of the opportunity and our position investing to really position ourselves well across
industries and geographies. And the key elements of it I tried to call out in opening comments,
investing in product, go-to-market, data centers. And you can see it in the results. I think you
are going to continue to see us building there, and that's what we're talking about building
ahead. We are keenly focused on delivering for both customers and shareholders. And that, of
course, includes an intense focus on the path to profitability.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes, and on your question on YouTube, on the
overall development and the subscription side. Our direct response business on YouTube was
practically nonexistent three years ago, and now it's one of our largest and fastest-growing ad
offerings on YouTube. And with TrueView for Action, we're actually making it easier for
advertisers to unlock opportunities to reach audiences with video campaigns. And just to give
you a few numbers, 60% of TrueView for Action customers are new to YouTube. And we more
than doubled the number of active advertisers using TrueView for Action in the first six months
of 2020.
And we're really tapping into the tremendous innate commercial behavior on the platform. 70%
of YouTube viewers are saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. I
talked about L’Oreal earlier – MasterClass is another great example. Online learning has
become a huge opportunity, and they use TrueView for Action to connect the right people to the
right content. And so, really big – like 140% increase in clicks to their sites, 70% increase in
signups to courses, and so on. YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand
advertisers as well. Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic –
rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. And it really helps advertisers reach younger audiences they
can't reach anywhere. We now reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks
combined, watch time is increasing, advertiser effectiveness is getting better and better and so
this is very nice development.
8
On the subscription strategy, maybe just briefly, Music is an incredibly popular vertical on
YouTube and, obviously, a key part of the overall experience. We found that users wanted a
premium YouTube experience and, basically the ability to download songs and videos.
YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams, of course, for music labels and
publishers as well. In 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. We have over
30 million Music and Premium paid subscribers. We are now operating over 95 countries. So
members get a lot of extra benefits.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP
Morgan. Your line is now open.
Doug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Ruth and Sundar, I just
wanted to follow up on Eric's question a bit. Anything else you can add just in terms of the
significant inflection that you saw on Google Cloud backlog there? And, I guess, in particular,
curious in what you're seeing in terms of benefit and success as you're leveraging Alphabet
more broadly, like in the Ford deal? And then how do you think about Google Cloud margins
structurally kind of long-term relative to peers? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe I'll start with the – customers are looking
for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they're definitely interested
in a broader solution set across the breadth of what Google and Alphabet can bring. We see
this in healthcare, our efforts in Google Health – work that's happening in Verily all end up
helping. Ford is great example of – as they are thinking longer term, not just for Cloud but
Android auto-powering their vehicles. And so these are big transformations cutting across the
company. And one of the areas where we are really executing is leveraging our global business
operations that Philipp runs in partnering closely with Thomas's teams. And that definitely
brings in a lot of synergies here.
On your second question, on the broader stuff, the one thing I would say is – and I mentioned in
part earlier, we get into these long-term deals, and so over time, as you add more cohorts, that
contributes to the margin structure. It is – the scale of the product offerings, the number of
areas and the number of regions in the world, there's a much more significant investment. And
so there's definitely a fixed cost structure associated with it. And we are also investing ahead.
But as we scale up the business, we expect the trends to be favorable.
Doug Anmuth (JP Morgan): Thank you.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Your line is now open.
Brent Thill (Jefferies): Good afternoon. Yes, you mentioned you accelerated – saw
accelerating brand spend in the quarter, and many investors are asking the sustainability in
what you're seeing in that as you head into the beginning of this year. If you could just talk
directionally in terms of how your clients are acting as they head out of the holiday season, that
would be helpful. Thank you.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Sure. I'll take that. As we've each noted, the financial
results really did reflect this increase in advertiser activity. And that was in part unlocking
9
budgets that they had paused earlier in the year, as well as really reflecting the increase in
consumer online activity. The largest contributor, as Philipp mentioned, was retail, the largest
contributor to year-on-year growth of the Ads business, though I would say tech, media, and
entertainment, as well as CPG, were also meaningful contributors.
And for Search, we saw ongoing improvement in advertiser spend broadly. For YouTube, direct
response, as Philipp talked about, really did maintain a very high level of growth and the
acceleration in overall YouTube revenue growth reflects a pickup in brand advertising across all
verticals on top of the ongoing strength that we saw in DR. And then in Network, also, same
point – it's this pickup in advertiser spend – as Philipp noted, it was led by growth in AdMob and
Ad Manager.
So we are really pleased with Q4. It was a great end to a challenging year. And when we think
about 2021, I made the point in opening comments, we obviously have easier year-on-year
comparisons in the first half as we anniversary the effects of the pandemic. So not much more
to add. It was a strong quarter, and we feel really good about the level of activity.
Brent Thill (Jefferies): Thanks, Ruth.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman
Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heath Terry (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate the level of detail on
the drivers behind the acceleration in Search and YouTube. I was wondering if you could go a
bit further and disaggregate or give even just qualitatively the drivers behind that acceleration
between pre-pandemic advertisers returning to prior spending levels versus new advertisers or
new advertiser spend being allocated to the platform?
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google: Well, I think the main point is sort of this mega
comment that we saw a slowdown. And as Philipp said, and we talked about on prior calls, one
of the first things that happens is a step back, and then you see as users re-engage and activity
picks up and the effectiveness of advertising, the ROI available, you see advertising come back
in. I remember talking about this throughout last year, that we had seen this, actually, going
back to the prior financial crisis. And what you've seen is just a broad-based re-engagement,
which we're really pleased about across industries. And it's also, as Philipp noted in his
comments, there's been a tremendous opportunity really to step in here and help small,
medium-businesses as they were evolving and adapting to this new digital world, and it's been
quite key there as well.
Heath Terry (Goldman Sachs): Great. Thank you very much.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan
Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Philipp.
Philipp, the first one, I appreciate all the color on retail and commerce, the merchant community
growing so strong in the last year. I'd be curious to hear about your discussions now with
merchants and sort of what the largest friction points that they're looking for you to solve and

sort of continue to help them as the world reopens – kind of the merchant discussions. And then
secondly, a question on one of the earlier products, on Discover Feed. Love to hear about sort
of early learnings on Discover Feed and how you think about hurdles you need to overcome to
monetize that.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thank you very much for the question. Look, at
the highest level, we want to build a healthier ecommerce ecosystem. When people come to
Google to shop, we want them to help find the best products or the best prices from really the
widest range of merchants, and we want our results to be as comprehensive and relevant as
possible. And we took some significant steps last year, as you know, on Google Shopping. And
in many ways, we really see them as a return to first principles here – free listings, zero
commissions, really good feedback helps lower barriers for online retail. So we've become a
great place for stores to connect with potential customers, whether it's by driving traffic to the
websites, for free listings or ads, or just by making it easier for purchases to happen directly on
Google. And by the way, let me be clear, also Shopping Ads will continue to be a powerful way
for retailers to promote their products, obviously.
So, overall, we're providing an open ecosystem that works for every kind of business, from
national chains and online marketplaces to just your small local stores. And we're giving
retailers more choice, which is very well-received, by opening our platform to third-party
providers – we talked about this starting with PayPal and Shopify. And we brought YouTube
into the fold, and we've begun experimenting with a feature that lets you learn a lot more about
products in videos on a limited set of channels and so on and so on. So I would say, overall, it's
very, very well-received.
On the Discover side, Discover has grown – so Discover is Discover and, obviously, Discovery
Ads. So Discover has grown dramatically since we launched it, I think, just three years ago.
People are loving how we're surfacing relevant information, gorgeous visuals, all in what we call
queryless feed experience. And, naturally, some of these experiences are commercial. And we
made Discovery Ads generally available about six months ago – I think it was May 2020. And
it's already reaching up to 3 billion people across Discover, YouTube, Gmail, and that's
worldwide. And advertisers love how we're able to drive performance objectives by really
matching their premium creatives with Google intent on our – what we call queryless surfaces.
Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great, thanks.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from
Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian (Baird): Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Maybe for Sundar or
Philipp, a follow-up on YouTube. Just given the strength of those services, ads and
subscriptions, during the pandemic, I wonder if part of what we're seeing is more of an
acceleration from TV ad budgets from linear spending to more of YouTube spending. I mean,
given also the momentum we've seen in over-the-top over the last nine months or so. And then
given some of the changing industry dynamics around privacy, including what you've already
announced around browser cookies, wondering what plans might be as well for Android and
how I should think about the potential impact on ad revenues broadly as a result of privacy
changes? Thank you.

Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yeah, I can take that. We've seen brands steadily
shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become
more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning
to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV.
Connected TVs are our fastest growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people
that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps
advertisers reach younger audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We talked about it –
YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined.
And so there is an opportunity – big opportunity – for YouTube to help brands and agencies
really more easily connect with this audience, and we're very invested in this space. And just to
give you a few examples, in the second half of last year, we launched a YouTube masthead on
TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in, basically, a single
moment. Many are taking advantage of it – Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for
YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad
performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time, and so on. And we also made it
possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and
YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens. And one, will be called one singular lineup.
Quickly, on the third-party cookie strategy, in general, we know that expectations are really
changing for how data is used online. And people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking
our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very,
very seriously. In 2019, we announced the Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards
initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of
privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web. And we're making great progress.
We shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback. We shared
recently as well our – what we call, FLOC – our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we
think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe
Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration
with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we
call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web.
Colin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks, Philipp.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from
MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks. Philipp, I was following up on Colin's
question just perfectly. I wanted to understand frameworks because if you think about the
bigger opportunity longer term and prioritize – priorities in streaming video, right? So are you
happy with the progress of YouTube TV so far? Will you expand into other countries? And could
you contrast that with the opportunity you see in [indiscernible] TVs and devices as you have
done for Google TV or Chromecast? And then is there a perceived added value from
advertisers for this type of inventory? Does it attract a new type of advertiser to offer YouTube
TV inventory or Connected TV inventory from traditional YouTube advertising?

Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Maybe I'll comment on – one of the things which
has worked well for Google over the years is we really try to reach users where they are. And
that's how Google has worked always. We've invested across platforms, across devices, across
countries. And I think the same applies for the YouTube experience. We want to bring it to the
screen that's most convenient for users. And, hence, our investment in Google TV,
Chromecast, YouTube TV as a whole itself.
And I think – we are taking a long-term view here, obviously focused on the user experience
and really getting it all to work well. We know while smartphones are at the center, for YouTube,
TV is an important form factor. And over time, people will use it across multiple screens. And so
that's the experience we are focused on. And anytime we create that experience, we know over
time there is value to be captured commercially as well that makes sense for advertisers. But
we take a long-term view.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: And I talked about the Connected TV part already.
Maybe briefly just on YouTube TV. YouTube TV continues to gain momentum. Our advertising
efforts on YouTube TV itself are still very, very early. But we think there is an opportunity to
apply some of our targeting and measurement capabilities to really provide a better user and
advertiser experience over time. And, yes, we heard from customers. They have a very strong
interest in advertising and streaming environments. I mentioned how we combine it in the single
lineups. So that's an interesting path going forward.
Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thank you.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit
Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju (Credit Suisse): Okay. Thank you so much. So, Sundar, I think let's – I think you
recently talked about a 10-to-20-year journey for AI and quantum computing to unlock new use
cases. I think you've brought up in the past some of the ways AI is helping you with the
products that you have in market right now. But as we take a more longer-term look into the
future, what do you think some of the new applications could be? And I think, Philipp, it might
have been a few years ago when you were speaking at an investor conference and you called
out the desire to onboard and help SMBs, particularly as they really had no way to advertise
before. And Google and online in general presented a golden opportunity to really help them
grow their business. So where do you think you are in terms of putting together an easy-to-use
set of tools to help those who otherwise don't really have agency representation, so that they
can reach all the different customers that they should be reaching across all the diverse
services that you're offering? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Stephen. And I'll answer the AI part first.
We've always wanted to be foundational in how we approach technological advances. That's
the core competency we invest in across the company. We're one of the largest R&D investors
in the world and, obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we – over the past
few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text,
images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is – we definitely – I think we are at an inflection point.
And we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in a more
generalized way. And when we do that, it will apply horizontally across our products.

You saw a version of that when we shipped BERT in Search, and it was one of our biggest
quality improvements. But you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android,
as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view
and definitely want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp?
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes. So first, let me recognize – I mean, it has
obviously been a very, very challenging environment for SMBs: many weren't online, many lost
line of sight to demand overnight due to COVID. So around this time last year, as soon as we
saw the scale of the impact, we really accelerated products that give our customers, and
especially our SMB customers, signals to help them actually navigate and pivot.
And as I noted earlier, as more consumers moved online and advertisers obviously responded
by reactivating spend, we also saw our advertiser base grow, particularly the number of smaller
advertisers or SMBs. We're helping them see shifts in supply and demand, not just across
sectors but actually within sectors. For example, travel continues to get hit hard, pretty hard.
And after the initial lockdown last year, searches for vacation homes and B&B rentals saw huge
spikes. And that continues to fluctuate.
On the other hand, look at retail – demand isn't disappearing, it's shifting in many cases. We're
seeing increases in searches for things like gym equipment, crafts, patio heaters, and so on,
anything related to outdoor activity and so on. We're obviously thinking about how to help SMBs
on products like Maps. Like, over the last five years, we've made more than a thousand
improvements to business profiles, making it a lot easier for merchants to connect with
customers. And especially now in the crisis, in 2020, we added new features to, for example,
provide COVID updates, service changes, and new attributes like takeout, delivery, curbside
pickup, now all easily available for consumers on Maps to connect them to their favorite SMBs.
So really incredible investment, frankly, from our side, and I think it's very well received.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would
like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.
Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look
forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 call. Thank you and have a good
evening.
Candice (Operator): Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for
participating. And you may now disconnect.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I am joined this afternoon by our
CFO, David Goulden.
Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth
quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will
provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks.
For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share
our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond.
Without a doubt, 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen and our
results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019; however, travelers still booked 355 million room
nights through our platform during 2020, and we remained profitable by generating approximately $880 million in
adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our
team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners
while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently.
When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us
navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of
the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the
next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it
returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans.
In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps, including
quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and
safety of our employees which was, and continues to be, a top priority; working closely with travelers and supply
partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations; and bolstering liquidity and
preserving cash by halting stock buybacks, cutting non-essential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital
through a debt offering. And we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the
business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands
across the company.
As a result of these actions, our 2020 year-end head count decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily
in volume-related positions. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million
in personnel expenses with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. Although our work is never done in
terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies, we believe the head count reductions needed to optimize the
business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. Finally, we believe we have
positioned the business well for when travel demand returns.
We continued to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020, and this progress has continued
as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels and are being agile in
adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment, and we will leverage our learnings from the past year to
continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team
has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right
to encourage people to travel once again and use our services.

As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the
recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new,
potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants, and on the timing of effective and broad-based
vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. We are
tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the UK and Germany,
relative to what we are seeing globally, although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were
at the same point in time in 2019.
While seeing green shoots of the summer booking season as positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will
continue and whether we'll see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions and, of
course, whether these advanced bookings will turn into stayed room nights or will be canceled. What will be most
helpful will be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution while providing
direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry.
Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed and recovery will not be possible until government
restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified so that travelers who can show they are safe travelers are
allowed to travel freely. As you know, our international business has been a great advantage for us historically,
and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery.
We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this firsthand in 2020, when we witnessed a
strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows in April through the peak summer travel season driven in
part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more
domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restricted travel environment and still found
a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a
high level of pent-up demand for travel, but when this demand will be fully unlocked is, of course, difficult to
predict and will depend on vaccination rates and other factors.
While the timing of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on the things we can
control, primarily, better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic
priorities, including expanding the payment platform at booking.com, building out our Connected Trip capabilities
and growing our market share in the United States.
Our integrated payment platform at booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our
supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. It is strategically
important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at booking.com but
we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational
for enabling our Connected Trip strategy.
We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of booking.com's gross
bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This is up from approximately 15% in 2019, and was less than 4%
back in 2017, so this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements
in our booking.com US payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical
market. We expect to see a higher percentage of booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment
platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021.
Our Connected Trip vision is a multiproduct offering including accommodations, flights, ground transportation and
attractions and dining, connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized
intelligence to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing

their trip. We're building towards this vision because we believe that Connected Trip will drive increased loyalty
and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business through additional customer
acquisition and merchandising opportunities.
Developing a robust flight product at booking.com remains an important strategic component of the Connected
Trip as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity
to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will
represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA
dollars.
As mentioned in the past, growing our share of the US travel market remains a key strategic priority for our
company as the US is one of the largest travel markets in the world, and we have historically under-indexed there.
We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the US market and are focused on making sure
we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and
merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our booking.com through marketing and
expanding our alternative accommodations supply.
While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a
significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involve product improvements, supply
acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on booking.com.
Continuing to invest and execute against these three strategic priorities as well as capturing demand as travel
recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieving
higher-growth rates, increasing market share and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than
we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and nonaccommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates, but we expect it to
continue to lead the travel industry in this metric.
Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal from the Digital Markets Act and Digital
Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations aimed at keeping the
markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support; however, at the present time, it is not known for
certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other
market participants. We are engaged with stakeholders to work towards regulations that tackle the legitimate
problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital economy, of which we believe we are not one. We'll update you in
the area during future calls.
In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts
remain high and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow; however, I am more confident than ever
in our long-term future. And we will, at some point, see a strong recovery in travel demand.
I firmly believe that our company is very well-positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the
meantime, we will focus on what we can control. Namely, investing in our business and executing against our
strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footing which will enable us to build a larger and fastergrowing business over the long run.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.

David Ian Goulden
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some
color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our
longer-term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth
rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable periods in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information
regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now, on to
the results for the fourth quarter.
On our November earnings call we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early
November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third
quarter to about 58% in October and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the seven days leading up to
our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts and many European countries and governments
beginning to respond with impositions of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the
impact of cancellations.
The worsening trends we saw in early November improved a little, resulting in our reported room nights declining
60% for the fourth quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth
rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rates declined quite considerably.
Looking across the other regions, North America was similar to Q3 and Asia and the rest-of-world both improved
compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with a significantly lower year-on-year decline in
room nights than the other regions. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continued to gain share in the
fourth quarter and represented over two-thirds of our total room nights in Q4 and about two-thirds of 2020.
We also continued to see greater than 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel.
Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019,
which was just below 50%. Our cancelation rates continued to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also
increased versus Q3.
We continue to monitor other changes in booking.com's customer booking behavior. The mix of customers
booking alternative accommodations in Q4 was slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly
versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the
underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative
accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continued to increase year-over-year within Europe in
Q4. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represents about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year
2020.
The booking window contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter at about the same rate that we saw in the third
quarter, as customers continued to focus mainly on their short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in
Q4, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations
decreasing about 15% year-over-year on constant currency basis.
Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected,
revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited
from check-ins in Q4 from bookings we received in the relatively strong third quarter.

Our full year revenue was also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings, driven by differences in the
timing between fees and revenue, which is recognized at check-in, primarily related to 2019 bookings that
checked in in Q1 2020.
As a result of these [indiscernible] (00:18:53) factors, our full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was
19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross
bookings in 2020 had been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year.
The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is almost entirely explained by this timing difference.
The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we
significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses
decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we've almost entirely completed our restructuring
actions, reduced personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The savings
recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110
million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the
restructuring and other exit costs line for Q4 and the full year respectively.
Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a
significant reduction in demand in paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend
in response to the diminished travel demand environments. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-overyear primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payments transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in
customer service to outsourced call centers.
Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously.
G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary spend in such areas as
T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology
expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to
cybersecurity and privacy software.
Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L and I'll that note
these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results.
We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was
meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impacts of non-tax-deductible expenses on
a lower base of earnings as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax
rate was driven by a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected pre-tax results in the
fourth quarter.
On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million
in the quarter as the benefit from the unrealized $553 million pre-tax gain on our equity investments primarily
related to our investment in Meituan was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest
expense and $61 million of FX remeasurement losses on our euro bond. We excluded the unrealized gains and
the remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results.
The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan
unrealized gain and a change in our full year tax provision following better-than-expected results in the fourth
quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to the

reasons mentioned for our non-GAAP tax rate with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge driving an
additional significant impact.
Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion
from our September ending balance of $14.9 billion due to an operating cash outflow largely offset by the
unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter
driven primarily by changes in working capital which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the
quarter as well as the net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects
that were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3.
We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position in the high level of uncertainty created by the
COVID pandemic and consistent with our comments last quarter, we halted repurchases of our stock and will not
initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery.
Now, on to our reports for the first quarter, and I should remind you we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless
otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery
for travel, which means we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time.
January room night declines were slightly worse than Q4 driven by an increased spread of COVID-19, including
the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions; however, somewhere near the middle of January, we
saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most parts of the world, and we
see this improvement continuing into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive
domestic room night growth.
While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continue to improve, Q1 room night
declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently,
room night declines of less than a day were about 50%.
In Q1, the overall booking window has contracted versus 2019 although to a lesser extent than we saw in the
fourth quarter. In Western Europe, in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019, and we
have seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings, including those for summer
travel, has increased.
As Glenn noted, in Western Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany, we have recently seen stronger summer
booking trends relative to what we're seeing globally and in these countries, gross bookings for the summer
period are within 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western
Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel
restrictions and we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancelable.
We're also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress with vaccinations including Israel,
UAE and the UK. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are
lifted, people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel where vaccination rates are the highest in
the world and after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7, we quickly saw domestic
bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019.
Turning to the income statement. As I said we expect Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points
better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to

continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings
assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter.
We expect marketing expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other
expenses in Q1 will be similar to what we were in Q4 on a dollar basis with some variability based upon where Q1
volumes land. We expect personnel expenses in Q1 will be slightly higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis
primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increases in benefit costs partially offset by a higher
amount of savings in Q1 related to restructuring actions we've taken. We expect that almost the full run rate from
our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1.
We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as they were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect that IT
expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security,
data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring
charges related to our actions at booking.com will be about $40 million and we expect to record more than half of
these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million relates to personnel-related actions and
the other half relates to real estate.
Given what we just explained, and reminding you Q1 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to
report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4.
For the full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our top-line
operating margins for the year. We expect the environment for travel will improve during 2021 but the shape and
timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were preCOVID, putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than
our room nights.
As I noted earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing
factors which benefited our 2020 revenue by more than $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we
experience an acceleration in bookings which will lead to our gross bookings recovering faster than revenue. Said
another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021, there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in in
2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in in 2021. This timing factor could have a
meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, but exactly how meaningful this
impact will be depends on how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021.
Due to these differences in the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing
expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. The most significant
expense item is sales and other, our payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We
expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than 2019 but the reduction will be smaller than the reduction in
revenue.
A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses for 2021 and how they'll most likely compare
with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses,
with some variability from GST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year.
Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better,
there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit
was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was an annualization
of people expense we added during 2019, and the rest was from people expense added to the business in the

first quarter of 2020. Our restructuring actions will reduce head count expenses by approximately $370 million. So
the impact of these two together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019.
As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end head count to be a little higher than at the end
of 2020, with a mix shift towards product and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel
expenses in 2021. And finally, SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to a few factors including the
modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020.
Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational
system enhancements to support our Connected Trip strategy. As we think beyond 2021, we're looking forward to
being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we had prior to COVID. We're
also focused on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe it will be years and not
quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that
time, I'd like to draw your attention to two factors.
The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other
Connected Trip verticals will add revenue and EBITDA but at much lower margin rates than traditional
accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other, plus some additional
personnel and other expenses. Flights and other Connected Trip verticals will add to bookings and revenue, but
at lower take rates than accommodations and will also require added personnel and other expenses as the
business scales.
The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume-related functions
including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in
2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business. As we've mentioned before, we'll look to do this in costefficient ways but the work will come back. We think it's important to include these considerations when thinking
about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA
margin rates albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019.
In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities.
We're now more confident than ever that through these actions we will emerge from this crisis in a stronger
position.
We'll now take your questions. And, Grace, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions.

Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Thanks for the questions. I guess a couple. First just following up on those last comments you made, David, on
the margins. I guess obviously, a lot of the reductions you've seen, as you said, have been kind of variable related
to business. Is there anything that you're kind of just learning to do better or more efficiently that might result in
kind of better cost line items as a percent of revenue coming out of this on the other side? And then I guess the
second one, curious if you guys expect any impact to your performance, marketing spend efficacy from kind of
upcoming changes in Apple's iOS 14 that may impact retargeting, anything you guys expect there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, why don't I take the first one, and then, Glenn, we'll see if you want to take a start on the second one. So
on the efficiency side, we're always looking for ways to become more efficient within the business. As I
mentioned, we have reduced these variable costs to the tune of about $370 million. As they come back, we will
look at more efficient ways of getting that work done.
The work will come back. It won't come back this year. We've basically right-sized ourselves through what we
think will be through 2021, but as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring, those costs will
come back. So we will look at more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location,
technology, whether we do it on the inside or whether we deploy more partner resources et cetera.
And we also, Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiency in our fixed-cost part of the business. That's
not been a major focus the last 12 months, the major focus being surviving COVID. I think we've done a good job
of that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across
our [indiscernible] (00:35:49) portfolios, across things like procurements, where we can continue to drive
efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment that's something else we
could also take a look at driving as well. And Glenn?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
And, Lloyd, your question's a good one, because we continue to see changes not only by companies like Apple
making changes that you just mentioned, but Google doing differences and governments certainly talking about
laws and regulations about cookies and all sorts of things that impact different ways that people do marketing, in
particular performance marketing and different things. And that can impact companies, certainly in the short term,
and we're all just looking, trying to evaluate what do we think this will mean for any one of these things and kind of
– but the thing I'd really focus on is that change can also be good.
We believe that we have some of the best marketing people in the world in terms of digital marketing, so when
changes happen, we can make adjustments. We can make changes. We can do things faster and better. And we
have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than

we were in the past. So right now there's nothing I can say in terms of impact or not, except as so far as to say
we've been adapting and changing as this world of digital marketing has been changing for 20 years, and we've
kept on top of it. And so I'm so confident that we'll be able to make any adjustments we need to make for the
future.

line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Justin Post
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Great. Thank you. A couple questions. First, Airbnb's success has been hard to miss, but just wondering how you
think about your market share within Europe and your position with larger hosts maybe than smaller individual
hosts and what the that means in a recovery. And then secondly, Glenn, would love to hear about your thoughts
on suppliers. Obviously a lot of pain in the travel industry. How can you help suppliers in the recovery? And do
you think you'll be getting more promotional activity from suppliers, maybe better take rates, anything we could
think about on that front? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Sure. So with regards to the home or alternative accommodations we like to call it in Europe, I don't think we've
talked much about regional exact share. And I'm not going to here. But I certainly, we talked a little bit how Europe
is our stronghold in that area, we're better there in the home area than other areas. But throughout the world, I
think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the
single property because we know that's an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now.
And with the pandemic there certainly was a bit of a shift for some people that they wanted to be isolated away
from other people, so certainly there was more demand than in the past for the single home area. That showed up
much more in the US for us, say, than the Europe, because Europe, we do have a – greater amount of our home
supply is the single property than say in the US. But it's an area we're going to continue to focus on and I do
believe right now in the environment there is, that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in
the future we'll see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be where there's a
different split between homes and hotels.
In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we're doing everything we
can to help our partners. And that's coming up with new ways to come up with promotions that they want to do,
telling them when we think there are spots in demand that they can come up with different types of closed user
group prices that can help get them more demand, coming out with ways they can put together things in content
in terms of safety and health so that a traveler who looks on our site and sees their hotel and sees that is a safe
place to go, doing all different things with them to try and prove their business. It's very difficult right now as you
know though because, let's face it, unless there's demand that you can have the greatest content in the world, but
if people don't feel it's time to travel, they're not going to travel. But we're going to continue to do that.

I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly as a distributor, when there is less demand, we are more valuable
as a partner to them. In at a time where there's very, very high occupancy rates, any hotel would say well, I don't
need the distributor nearly as much. But when they don't have as much occupancy rate, then they start looking for
demand and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are the place
for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand and we're continuing to work with them to make
sure they do their best together.

Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is
open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Kopelman
Analyst, Cowen and Company Q
Great. Thanks a lot. I just had some follow-ups on your comments about gaining market share in the US. Can you
talk more about your focus there? Do you consider it an increasing priority for the company compared to the past
year or two? And on the marketing side of that, that you mentioned, do you anticipate being focused more on
brand or performance marketing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Well, let me start with the first one, Kevin. We absolutely have begun to focus more on the US. It's always been a
priority, so don't get me wrong in that area. But certainly we've made a couple of changes that are focusing more
specifically in the US. Now, as we scaled the company over many, many years, we had a very global presence
and we tried not to make changes solely for any particular market, really believing that scaling the business,
keeping everything the same, was the best way to achieve a very, very large global share of the business. That
being said, we've come to a state where we recognize that we continue to be under-indexed in the US and maybe
we need to make some changes there, which we are doing. And I think that we will make some progress in that.
In terms of whether we're going to do it in brand or in terms of performance marketing, I'm not going to give away
the playbook here. I will say though we absolutely are doing the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in
terms of obviously we do want to increase awareness, we obviously want to increase the total amount of supply,
increase our alternative accommodation, doing all the things that are necessary to make sure we are getting the
share of the business that we believe we should be getting.

Got it. That's great. And then just a quick clarification on the statistics you gave about the past week being down

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric J. Sheridan
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Thank you so much. Maybe two if I can. Following up on the comments you've made around brand and maybe
some of the changes we'll see in digital advertising, whether it be first-party data or third-party data, how important
do you see the concept of sort of aligning your brand with consumer, maybe even building greater depth in loyalty
and rewards programs going forward, especially if you're aiming again sort of a wider revenue pool and a wider
product set? Love to get your thoughts there, Glenn.
And where the world has begun to open up a little bit, where you have some exposure, can you give us a little bit
of sense of how you've sort of – the pace of leaning back in to marketing channels and that deleverage that
maybe you guys are calling out as things get better, just so we could better understand a little bit of the timing
mismatch there. Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So, Eric, loyalty is a important thing because it really talks about something that we talk about a lot is bringing
people home direct to us. And we've talked about this numerous times, how we believe getting people to come
back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. And certainly one of the ways we do that is by

providing our loyalty version, which is our Genius program booking.com, which really does, we believe, give some
real value to consumers.
And that's something that we're going to continue on because in the end, it could cost an awful lot of money, as
we know, to get a new customer. It's cheaper to keep them. So we're going to keep on doing all the things we can
to keep people coming back direct. And you're right about first part – could be third party, it'd be all these different
ways that we worry about how we're going to get people to come in the future, certainly important to get new
customers but also real important to keep them coming back.
In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned about how uncertain the world is right now, and
one of the things you're trying always to do is make sure you're spending money, that that's going to create
revenue. One of the issues, you pay the money upfront, person books but because so much of the business
nowadays being done on things that are cancelable, you don't know when change happens; all of a sudden
money you spent doesn't up increasing the revenue you thought it was and your ROI ends up very different.
So we have to look at this very carefully and we are approaching it in a cautious light. But on the other hand, we
don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. We certainly look at all the data very, very closely, and that's
about the best I can say is that's how we're handling it right now. We can't say anything more now because we
don't know what the future's going to be quite yet.
[indiscernible] (00:46:12)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
And then, Glenn, just to build on that. Eric, just to give you a little bit more color to the answer. The deleverage
you mentioned in 2021 on – towards marketing is not us calling ROIs per se, it's to do with the timing that I talked
about whether that we expect to basically spend money in 2021 for lower revenue or revenue in 2022. And that
phenomenon is what will drive the deleverage in 2021 we talked about for performance marketing, just to clarify.

of them for the first time perhaps in several months or a year, just curious what you think they'll see that's most
significant in terms of how the product has changed or the experience has changed? Is it Connected Trip or
something else? And then secondly, just wanted to get your view on some of the subscription-based programs
that we're seeing across the space for travelers? Thanks.

Sure. So one of the things that somebody may not have seen before and we talked about last quarter is
booking.com selling flights, for example. That's a great thing that in the past we didn't do; now they come back,
and they're oh, look they sell flights, which is a great thing.
Another thing that we continue to build-out in our attractions area, not a lot of people are actually buying
attractions right now. But we haven't stopped getting more and more places and more and more content so that
when people do come back, they'll have attractions they can buy from us. And what they obviously will see would
be the labor combining this, putting things together, I mean, the way we're trying to create value for our
consumers. So I think that's part of it.
And we're really still in the very, very early parts of this journey, but it's something that is pretty exciting to
beginning to see it build out and seeing those people are buying flights and such.
With regards to the subscriptions model that people are beginning to explore and such, I don't really have a lot of
comment on that. It's something that different people are doing and such. We'll see how it plays out. I don't know,
David, do you have anything you want to say on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Nope. Nope. No further comments, we'll see how they play out. I think our model, the way we have it, is the model
we think is certainly very attractive and has been successful for us. And as you say, we'll watch what happens in
these other spaces.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Naved Khan
Analyst, Truist Securities Q
Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a question on air bookings. So your air tickets sold number was
positive, and that in this kind of environment I think is pretty impressive. Maybe are there any insights you can
share with – in terms of the early results you might be seeing on integrating air tickets on your booking.com site in
Europe? And then the other question I have is just on the attractions and experiences. With the increased
connection that you are driving, is it mostly through partnerships or are you signing up your own direct
relationships? How should we think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So in terms of air bookings and the question got a little muddled at the end so if I don't cover it completely, David,
maybe you heard it better and can fill out there. But, yes, we were pleased to see that positive number there. One
of the things to point out is as I just talked about a little bit though in the past, we didn't have air tickets coming
from booking.com and from also by the way, our Agoda brand also sells air tickets too. Priceline of course has
been selling air tickets since the start of the companies more than two decades ago, so it's easier when you add
two more of our brands selling air tickets that hadn't done it in the past to have a positive number. And it I want to

point out, this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't
take too much in it, except that we are on our journey.
In regards to attractions for booking.com, so it's yes. These are coming from third-party suppliers. We are
partnering with them. They give us the inventory to sell and we sell it. And we have a commercial relationship and
we're pleased, that's the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or you can decide which ones you want
to do first but it's a lot – you can't be everything. So it's a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to
partner with other people for things – for people who have already set up the things you need to get. So I'm pretty
pleased about that. Again, I'll be even more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying
attractions more.
David, I don't know if I missed anything on the air ticket, air stuff.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Ju
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Q
Okay. Thank you. So, Glenn, 20% of bookings running through your own payment rails suggest that it's now 70%
of your merchant bookings, so it seems like you're pretty close to full adoption there. So is this primarily for
alternative accommodations or flights? Or are you seeing that higher platform usage because of other use cases,
whether it's non-credit card users or otherwise?
And I guess over the coming months as you start more formally entering a recovery phase it's probably going to
feel like you're working at a hypergrowth startup, so with that in mind, I mean you spent the last year restructuring
and reducing head count. So wanted to get your latest thinking on whether you feel like your property restores at
this time or do you feel like you can spin up hiring and bump resources very quickly? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So let me start with the second one and I'll turn it over to David in terms of payments, in case he wants to add any
more color to that. In terms of people, and we've talked about this. We've been through the restructuring, I think
we both said in our prepared remarks how we are satisfied with where we are right now, but we also made the
very important point how much of the restructuring dealt with jobs that related to volume. And that as volume
comes back, we need to bring people in to help cover it, but hopefully in a much more efficient way over time, so
that thing.
In terms of being a hyper startup, yeah, look, we're always working incredibly hard in trying to get as much
progress as we can on our strategic vision, because we know that the travelers are going to come back and we

want to get ahead of them as fast as we can so we can give them the greatest value and the greatest different
types of way to travel as soon as we can.
I don't see any major change in 2021, but we'll see how fast business comes back and we'll see what happens in
2022 and we'll see the rate of progress in all our strategic different things we're working on. And I'll let David talk
about the payments platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah, on payments, let me clarify because I wasn't quite sure what you said, but let me try and clarify where we
are on payments and the evolution of payments at booking.com. So as we said in the prepared remarks, the
percentage of our gross bookings processed on the payments platform at booking.com was 22% last year. That's
up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That still means that the vast majority of bookings are not being processed
via our payment transaction. They are still in the agency model, so we expect that payments adoption to increase
above the 22% for this year and beyond.
Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons because we think we can deliver benefits to our
customers and our partners across all the different channels – hotels, alternative accommodations, flights,
attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandising which we'll use on a selected basis in
certain markets. And it's also fundamental to enabling the Connected Trip, where we want to have everything be
able to be paid in one place.
I'll give you an update on where we are from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of
payments. I'm pleased to say that our payments at booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We've
said in prior years we are still making that investment in the platform and we're focused upon still scaling it out but
expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here, obviously with
some potential minor differences year-in, year-out. But we are now out of the breakeven situation on that payment
platform, which is an update from where we were before.

Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two on alternative accommodations. So I believe you mentioned on the
segment had a healthy profit margin throughout 2019, so as we look forward to 2021 and beyond, how should we
think about how quickly you can close the gap between the alternative accommodation margins compared to
hotels? And secondly, you guys mentioned that you're trying to fix the single home supply in the US. How would
you describe the strategy there, is it mostly investing behind your own sales force or is it through acquisitions?
Thanks.

So they actually go a little together, those two questions, because one of the things, I believe, why we did have
that healthy profit, as you pointed out, was perhaps because we didn't have as much of a mix of the single home
property, because the single home property does cost more for the company because you do end up with more
contacts. It's just by nature. It's not as professionally run and you do end up with more costs. So we do though
know that this is a product that people want, and we need to have it and we need to have more of it and that's
absolutely correct.
The great thing about this though is there is a trend towards more professionalization of that single home
property, where the person in the past may have gone on to a platform and just signed up on their own and tried
to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people who want to rent
out their single properties going to different people who will do it for them, looking at all of the elements of it.
And those people who are running these kind of, we won't call them channel managers but they are like a channel
manager since they are able to bring these different single property owners and put them on to this site, that then
is able to direct that to or provide that supply to us or to somebody else, the great thing about it is these people
are much more professional, and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things
you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of
the single home properties faster than we had to in the past.
In regards to M&A, as you know, we don't comment on future M&A activity.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason B. Bazinet
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah. I just had two questions. If I posit that COVID is going to cause alternative to be larger than otherwise
would be and cause business travel to be structurally lower than otherwise would be, what is the implication for
your business as you move to Connected Trip and payments in a more forceful way? Can you just – do you mind
just expanding on that a bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
So we'll go with the hypothetical [indiscernible] (00:58:14) happening here. So people who perhaps in the past
never would have thought of using alternative accommodations, perhaps last summer they did use it or they
looked at it or something. And now, it is in the consideration set. So going forward what has happened is now
there's a much larger amount of supply for any traveler to go look at. And what that means is any individual
supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now, as a distributor, I talked about a little bit earlier
why that is beneficial to the distributor now, [indiscernible] (00:58:50) our business, which is so great because we
have both a great amount of the home product, that alternative accommodations, and we're one of the largest
people that have the hotels.
So we have this great thing where the consumer, when they come, they can come to one place, us. And they are
able to compare and contrast all the different types, all the different prices, understand all the different comments

and reviews being left by people who have previously stayed there. That gives us a great, great benefit. So I am
pleased with the way this is happening.
And I – will it go back? What will happen? How much will the mix be of home in the future versus hotel? I don't
know, I don't think anybody can really guess. I think over many years we've seen the trend going more and more
people interested in alternative accommodations, so the pandemic step-functioned it up higher. I don't know if
that's now going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward, I don't know. But from my point of view it's
not that relevant in the sense that we provide both, and we're going to keep getting both, so for me I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

And then on the enterprise side, B2B travel?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Well, the B2B travel, I don't think there's a lot to talk about that. David, I didn't hear exactly what the question was,
maybe you did.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Ian Goulden
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
I didn't hear it either, so why don't you clarify the question, Jason?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Yeah. Could you repeat the question, just the B2B question? Just repeat it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason B. Bazinet
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q
Yeah, the question was if COVID causes a structural shift in B2B travel, how does that influence sort of your focus
on payments and focus on the Connected Trip? Is it good? Is it bad? Does it have no bearing on your level of
investment and enthusiasm around those two long-term initiatives?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
When you say B2B travel, are you talking about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason B. Bazinet

Business travel.

Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc. A
Business travel, got it. Okay. Got it. Look, I have been saying for a long time I think it's going to be a while before
corporate travel picks up the same way leisure will pick up. It's going to be – it's going to take longer. And as the
share of total travel, it may never get back, in which case – yes, eventually because businesses will continue to

grow and the industry – obviously people will travel. Eventually business travel will be larger in an absolute
measure than in the past, but it may always be a smaller share. We don't really know yet, but certainly, the trends
that are going, go that way.
What that does to certain high ADR hotels that cater to the business traveler, they are going to have to make
some shifts because they aren't going to get as many of those high ADR customers anymore. And they need to
get more leisure travelers. Well, we have a higher percentage of leisure travelers than business travelers. We are,
again, that point where people can come and get that leisure demand, so again, it's another thing why I feel good
about our long-term future.

Super helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And that is all the time that we have for today. I will turn the call over back to our CEO, Mr.
Glenn Fogel, for any closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn D. Fogel
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.
Thank you. So in closing, I want to note that it's been a little more than a year since the pandemic began, and we
have sadly lost 500,000 mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, grandparents, and so tragically, children in the
United States alone; and globally, more than 2.4 million lives have been lost. Our hearts go out to all who mourn.
I also want to reiterate my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Arne Sorenson, as well as to the
entire Marriott organization. He left a profound mark on the travel industry and will be greatly missed. And it is so
sad, he will not see the recovery of the industry that he dedicated his life to. And the travel industry will recover
and we are working so very hard to bring travel back as fast as we can.
So I want to end by giving one last thank you to our partners, our customers, and most of all, to our dedicated
employees, who throughout the horrible year of 2020, rose to the challenge, met it and got us to where we are
today, well-positioned for a better tomorrow. Thank you. Please be safe. Good night.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for
joining. You may all disconnect.

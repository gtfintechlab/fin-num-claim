Thank you, Tiffany. Love and responsibility brought me back to Starbucks, my love of the company and my deep 
responsibility to our partners and shareholders. In the months I've been back, I've traveled the country and met 
with thousands of Starbucks retail store partners and visited all five of our roasting plants and I've learnt firsthand 
about the unique challenges confronting the company today. I've also experienced the passionate relationship our

partners have with the company and the enduring emotional connection our customers have to the Starbucks 
brand.
COVID presented unprecedented operating challenges to consumer brands. COVID also drove dramatic changes 
in customer behavior that Starbucks stores and systems were not designed or built for. The challenges have been 
amplified by record demand for Starbucks coffee in our US stores that has accelerated with the lifting of COVID 
restrictions. Our Q2 results tell the story.
In Q2, our sales comp in North America grew 12% over last year, 23% compared to Q2 2020. Both drive-thru and 
Mobile Order & Pay activity have surged, together now generating over 70% of our US store volume. Delivery, a 
nearly $500 million business, is up 30% in the first half of the fiscal year. And in our stores, customers are 
increasingly further customizing already complex hand-crafted cold beverages. The combination of shifts in 
customer patterns, accelerating demand and algorithms built for different customer behaviors has placed 
tremendous strain on our US store partners.
Ordinarily, we would have anticipated and invested ahead of the shifts we're seeing, but COVID disruptions 
interfered with our ability to make the required investments in store design, operations, infrastructure and 
technology to do so. As a result, we've been unable to meet the relentless demand we're seeing in our US stores 
as seamlessly as our customers and partners expect and candidly deserve. Simply said, we do not today have 
the adequate capacity to meet the growing demand for Starbucks coffee.
Going forward, we will be making investments in our partners and business to literally catch up on investments we 
have not made and make further investments to position the company ahead of the coming growth curve. We will 
also be accelerating our new store growth with 90% of new stores being high returning drive-thrus. Our newest 
class of drive-thrus will integrate new store designs, technology, including more handheld devices and equipment 
improvements that will increase efficiency, speed of service, and we believe deliver even greater profitability in the 
future.
We will then incorporate the new technologies and equipment into our existing stores and provide our people with 
the tools and resources they need to elevate the Starbucks experience we deliver to our customers and create 
even more demand in the future. And we will be making significant investments to extend our digital capabilities 
and deepen our digital connection to customers and the emotional attachment our customers have to the 
Starbucks brand.
Returns on our digital investments are consistently among the highest returns we generate. Which brings us to 
the decision we will revisit in fiscal 2023 to suspend stock buybacks. Buying back stock yields us on average 
about a 10% return. With Starbucks' treasure trove of global assets, a 10% return is not satisfactory to me. 
Throughout our history, the investments we have made in our people and business have always delivered outside 
returns to our shareholders. We're so eager to show off our pipeline of disruptive innovation that we're moving our 
Investor Day up to September in Seattle from December in New York.
The significant innovation around technology and personalization we will reveal are industry game changers that 
will further increase store productivity and efficiency. What you will see is the coming transformation and 
reimagination of the Starbucks customer and partner experiences. The transformation will accelerate already 
record demand in our stores. But the investments will enable us to handle the increased demand and deliver 
increased profitability, while also delivering an elevated experience to our customers and most importantly 
reducing strain on our partners.

We must reintroduce joy in the customer and emotional connection back into the partner experience. We've 
identified over $200 million of investment that is incremental to the significant investments we've already 
committed to in our US company-operated stores this year. These include further investments in training, wage 
and equipment. And new investments in internal communication with our people, where we will launch a new 
partner app to communicate directly with all store partners.
We will also be reaffirming our commitment to coffee excellence and partner education by reintroducing our Black 
Apron Coffee Master and Origin Trip programs. And in 2023, we will introduce enhanced digital tipping for our 
partners. We believe these investments will improve retention and recruiting and elevate the experience we 
deliver to our partners and our customers. Over the last month, we've realigned Starbucks' US organization to 
focus entirely on transforming and reimagining our core US business.
Belinda Wong will share plans for our accelerated growth in China as soon as COVID-related mobility restrictions 
there are lifted. And make no mistake, our aspirations around China have never been greater, and I remain 
convinced Starbucks business in China will be eventually larger than our business in the US. We have a big 
breakthrough idea around the launch of Starbucks Web 3.0 and a unique platform for NFTs that Brady Brewer 
and Adam Brotman, architect of Mobile Order & Pay and the Starbucks digital app, who is serving as a special 
advisor to us will shortly tell you about. I believe Web 3.0 will create an authentic digital third-place experience 
and drive substantial new revenue streams for Starbucks and be accretive to the brand. Our Web 3.0 strategy is a 
proxy for the greater ambition we have for the company going forward.
Despite the fact that post-COVID our customers are not using our stores the same way and we've been 
operationally challenged as a result, our national retail footprint and best-in-class real estate portfolio is still 
enabling us to meet customers wherever they are and irrespective of their need state. This relentless demand 
we're seeing in our stores today underscores this reality.
Looking ahead, try and imagine thousands of vastly more productive and efficient Starbucks stores reconfigured 
to align with today's customer behavior and built around technology that will deliver increased speed of service, 
improve labor management and reduce unit cost. An elevated partner and customer experience. Now imagine the 
accretive impact to our financials when we reengineer our stores to deliver what we're capable of, in delivering 
and arm our people with the tools and resources they need to once again exceed our customers' expectations.
From my perspective, I understand what's needed, and I'm back to lead this transformation and committed to 
seeing it through. Starbucks sits alone with something few if any of our peers literally have, and that is unmet 
demand. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing, promotions and social media trying to 
create demand. We have demand everywhere we look despite having not lived up to the expectations we set for 
ourselves let alone exceeding the expectations of our customers and our people since the pandemic. The big 
opportunity ahead for us is to meet strong and growing demand in our stores more efficiently and effectively and 
to leverage technology to enhance productivity and reduce burden on our store partners.
Let me highlight just a few sources of the accelerating demand we are seeing in our US stores and business. 
Mobile Order & Pay, an over $4 billion business, is up 400% in five years, is up 20% over last year. Our $500 
million delivery business is up 30% over the last year. The Starbucks card puts our brand in the hands of nearly 
120 million people and is alone larger than the entire gift card category. Starbucks customers are increasingly 
prepaying for their purchases in huge volumes, roughly $11 billion last year, and we are on track to exceed that 
figure this year.

At this moment, well over $1 billion is loaded on Starbucks Cards waiting to be spent in our stores, and active 
Starbucks Rewards membership in the US grew 17% over last year in Q2 to 27 million members. Strong 
underlying demand means the productivity and efficiency investments I've described represent literally lowhanging fruit available to us right now. In every sense, Starbucks remains a growth company today and will 
remain a growth company into the future. Two related dynamics underscore the power of the equity of the 
Starbucks brand and support our growth aspirations: consistent pricing power and strong demand for Starbucks 
products in CPG channels.
Over the last year, we raised prices several times to address increasing inflationary pressures. Yet we 
experienced negligible customer attrition once again, demonstrating the elasticity of demand for Starbucks coffee. 
Even so, inflationary pressures have outpaced our price increases resulting in several points of margin 
compression in the short-term and costing us over 200 basis points in the first half of the fiscal year.
In Q2, we were able to absorb the incremental cost while still delivering on our EPS expectations. In our channels 
business, Starbucks today has the number one share in US at-home coffee, and the number one share in global 
Ready-to-Drink coffee. Customer loyalty inside and outside our stores has never been greater. You have to ask 
yourself how many retail companies have a consumer brand that is best of class and literally the number one 
position in grocery and in multiple channels of distribution. You'd be hard pressed to find any. I could not be more 
optimistic or confident in the successful transformation and reimagination of our store, partner and customer 
experiences.
Let me turn to China. I cannot think of any other western consumer brand let alone a food and beverage retailer 
that has performed as well as us in China over the last 20 years. I say that with great pride having been to China 
so often, building confidence, trust and respectful relationships with government officials and working closely with 
our Chinese team. However, the situation in China is unprecedented. Shanghai, a city four times the size of New 
York City, is completely locked down. Other major cities including Beijing are experiencing new COVID outbreaks 
and implementing new mobility restrictions pursuant to China's strict zero COVID policy. Conditions in China are 
such that we have virtually no ability to predict our performance in China in the back half of the year. Given the 
materiality and the high level of ongoing uncertainty around China, accelerating inflation and the significant 
investments we're planning, the only responsible course of action for us to take is to suspend guidance for Q3 and 
Q4.
As we move through Q3 and approach September's Investor Day, we will have much greater visibility on Q4, 
holiday and fiscal 2023 and be in a position to share details around our comprehensive post-COVID China plan 
with you.
I'm very pleased with the growth we're seeing from our international business. Excluding China, our international 
segment grew comps in the double digits in the quarter, stronger than anticipated. Demonstrating the strength of 
our diversified portfolio and the opportunity ahead. Even including the impact of China, our international segment 
still grew 4% in the quarter over last year to a record $1.7 billion. Our international store base grew 9% over last 
year to over 17,700 stores. 50% of that growth was in licensed markets. We expect 75% of the net new stores 
we'll open in fiscal 2022 to be outside the US, further underscoring the enormous global growth and the 
opportunity ahead.
Now let me turn to a subject in the news. Across America, there is a movement in the media and across multiple 
industries including the service sector whereby fellow citizens have begun turning to labor unions as a means of 
gaining voice, representation and improved working conditions. This movement is not related to any specific

company. We are highly empathic to the root causes of the frustration and anxieties that Gen Z Americans are 
facing, having come of age during turbulent moments in our history.
The 2008 global financial crisis, the Great Recession, and now the global coronavirus pandemic. These young 
people have completely valid concerns given today's uncertainty and economic instability. They look around and 
they see the burgeoning labor movement as a possible remedy to what they are feeling. I understand the climate 
and I'm deeply sensitive to the needs of all of our Green Apron partners. Yet we have a very different and vastly 
more positive vision for our company based on listening, connecting and collaborating directly with our people.
Throughout our history at Starbucks, we have led our industry and in many cases corporate America in 
introducing breakthrough benefits for our people. Aon Hewitt, the gold standard in benefits, rates Starbucks in the 
100th percentile in the retail sector, the 100th percentile including for part-time workers who want stability and 
flexibility to achieve their future aspirations. That means no retail company in America ranks above Starbucks for 
the benefits we provide our people. We are proud of our history and leadership in wages and benefits, and we are 
committed to doing even more to meet the evolving needs of our Starbucks partners in the future. Ensuring 
success through wages and benefits with our partners is among our core values and has been for 50 years. And 
our values are not and never have been the result of demands or interference from any outside entity. It's who we 
are, it's who we have been and who we always will be.
Compare any union contract in our sector to the constantly expanding list of wages and benefits we have 
provided our people for decades, and the union contract will not even come close to what Starbucks offers. We 
remain committed to doing the right thing for each and every Starbucks partner, and that includes respect for 
differing opinions, inclusion, and embracing diversity and individuality.
Today, we take further steps to modernize our pay and benefits vision for our partners with further investments in 
wage, barista skills training, coffee excellence and financial wellness and literacy. And in September, we will 
share additional initiatives we are planning for Starbucks partners in areas that include help with student loan 
refinancing, additional skills recognition programs, enhanced in-app tipping and new profit-sharing initiatives.
Partners at Starbucks US company-operated stores where we have the right to unilaterally make these changes 
will receive these wages and benefit enhancements. This covers more than 240,000 Starbucks partners at 
roughly 8,800 Starbucks stores across the country. We do not have the same freedom to make these 
improvements at locations that have a union or where union organizing is underway. Partners at those stores will 
receive the wages increases that we announced in October 2021, but federal law prohibits us from promising new 
wages and benefits at stores involved in union organizing and by law we cannot implement unilateral changes at 
stores that have a union. Where Starbucks is required to engage in collective bargaining, we will negotiate in 
good faith. Starbucks will not favor or discriminate against any partner based on union issues. And we will respect 
the right of Starbucks partners to make their own decisions when exercising these rights.
A question I get asked frequently is how long are you going to stay? So let me try and preempt it here. I've just 
framed the enthusiasm and the optimism I have for our transformation plan going forward. We have line of sight 
on what the transformation looks like and how meaningfully our plan will benefit the company and our people as 
together we cocreate and reimagine the future chapters of Starbucks' storied history. The plan I share is being 
designed mindfully and strategically and will be executed successfully. This I can assure you. The Board and I 
have agreed I will stay to help transition our next leader. We are driving towards naming the new leader in the fall.
After joining the company, he or she will undergo full immersion and have the opportunity to collaborate with me 
for a defined, but not indefinite period. The plan is for me to completely hand over the CEO reins sometime in the

first calendar quarter of 2023 and to thereafter remain on the Starbucks' Board. Over the last 50 years we have 
built Starbucks into one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world, and we have delivered best-inclass returns to our shareholders since being a public company in 1992. The investments in our people and our 
company we discuss today will absolutely assure that despite our success in the past, our best days are ahead. 
We're looking forward to demonstrating what's ahead and the enthusiasm we have for sharing that with you on

Belinda Wong
Chairman, Starbucks (China) Co., Ltd.
Thank you, Howard. While we are into the third year of navigating through COVID in China, in Q2 we encountered 
the most severe resurgence of the virus to-date. 72% of the 225 cities we're in experienced Omicron outbreaks, 
including Shanghai and Shenzhen. With this more infectious variant, mobility restrictions and lockdowns are 
imposed faster and relaxed more cautiously. Starbucks' focus since the start of the pandemic has been to protect 
the health and well-being of our partners and customers, provide support and show up positively in our 
communities. Our efforts have deepened our connection to customers and made our partners proud.
Over the last two years, we have built up muscle and agility to navigate through COVID challenges. With every 
resurgence, we add new chapters to our China COVID playbook, strengthening our capabilities and resilience. As 
we moved into Q3, and continuing today, roughly a third of our stores remain temporarily closed or are offering 
delivery or MOP only, and most of our remaining stores are operating under strict safety protocols that interfere 
with our traffic and operations.
As a result, net revenue in China declined 14% and sales comp declined 20% in Q2 versus last year, after 
adjusting for the VAT subsidy all from reduced traffic. We expect an even greater impact on our Q3 results due to 
the timing of the Shanghai lockdown and the further resurgence of the virus in other cities, including Beijing. We 
expect mobility restrictions to continue under the country's zero COVID policy for the foreseeable future. In Q2, 
we continued to invest to increase our digital connection to customers.
As a result, digital mix now represents a record 43% of sales. Our launch of Starbucks Delivers on Meituan in 
January has driven incrementality and made Starbucks the coffee category leader on third-party delivery 
platforms. We remain laser-focused on our growth as we manage through short-term challenges. At our China 
Investor Day in 2018, we shared our aspiration to operate 6,000 stores in China by 2022. Despite years of COVID 
disruptions, we remain on track to do so adding 97 net new stores in Q2 with our new stores continuing to deliver 
best-in-class returns and profitability.
We also continue to invest in smart technologies to improve our productivity and efficiency, leverage our scale 
and deliver an elevated experience to our partners and customers. We're extremely proud that despite COVID 
challenges we achieved our highest ever customer connection score in March. The enduring loyalty and 
connection our customers have to the Starbucks brand sets us apart from all competitors.
Today, one in two coffee consumers in China chooses Starbucks over any other coffee retail brand, a huge lead 
that we have held for years and continue to build upon. Our dreams and aspirations for Starbucks China have 
never been greater, and I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in China while managing through the 
pandemic. Our accomplishments are due to the extraordinary dedication and efforts of our 70,000 partners. No 
coffee retailer in China is better positioned than Starbucks to navigate the current headwinds or to resume 
accelerated growth once COVID mobility restrictions are lifted.

Brady Brewer
Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp.
Thank you, Belinda. Starbucks is one of the most sought-after brands in the world, and by engaging deeply with 
our customers over 50 years, we've amassed a treasure trove of assets both physical and digital. Just one 
example being the nearly 27 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the US. We're activating these unique 
brand assets as a catalyst to accelerate the future of Starbucks as a global brand and as a business.
Now, from our beginning, we've nurtured human connection and served a fundamental belief that coffee brings us 
together. We brought this to life in what we've called the Third Place, a place between home and work where you 
could connect and feel a sense of belonging over coffee. Now we are extending the Third Place concept at 
Starbucks into a new kind of community. Emerging technologies associated with Web 3.0 and specifically NFTs 
now enable this aspiration and allow us to extend who Starbucks has always been at our core. We are creating 
the digital Third Place.
To achieve this, we'll broaden our framework of what it means for people to be a member of the Starbucks 
community. Adding new concepts such as ownership and community-based membership models that we see 
developing in the Web 3.0 space. We will lead by aligning our initiatives with our sustainability commitments 
making deliver a choice to build the community on environmentally sustainable Web 3.0 platforms. Imagine 
acquiring a new digital collectible from Starbucks where that product also serves as your access pass to a global 
Starbucks community, one with engaging content, experiences and collaboration all centered around coffee. This 
community will further strengthen the Starbucks brand, engage our partners, and we expect it to be accretive to 
our business.
Starbucks has a history of taking leading-edge technology and innovation and making it accessible and 
approachable to the mainstream. You've seen it with our digital experiences, whether it was introducing ability to 
pay with your phone, Mobile Order, or even access Wi-Fi long ago. Starbucks can serve as a bridge to the future 
for our nearly 100 million customer occasions per week around the world. We'll take our first step toward a digital 
Third Place and our broad vision for Web 3.0 with an anticipated launch in this year. This is just the beginning of 
an exciting future.
Now I'll turn it over to Rachel.

Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp.
Thank you, Brady, and good afternoon, everyone. As Howard mentioned, Starbucks' performance in Q2 
demonstrated strong customer demand across our portfolio despite continuing COVID headwinds. We delivered 
global revenue of $7.6 billion in Q2, up 15% from the prior year, a second quarter record. Our results were 
primarily driven by 18% revenue growth in the US and stellar performance across our diverse global portfolio. We 
are particularly pleased with these strong results in light of the dynamic environment. Q2 consolidated operating 
margin contracted 300 basis points from the prior year to 13% primarily due to inflation, which increased over the 
course of the quarter, significant investments in store partner wages and benefits, and reduced traffic in China. 
The margin contraction was partially offset by pricing in North America. Q2 EPS was $0.59 declining 3% from the 
prior year consistent with our expectations.

I will now provide some segment highlights for Q2. North America delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q2, up 17% 
from the prior year and also a Q2 record primarily driven by a 12% increase in comparable store sales comprised 
of a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transactions. Strong performance of new stores over the 
past 12 months and the accelerated recovery of our licensed stores also contributed to this compelling level of 
revenue growth. US comparable store sales were 12% despite significant store hour modifications in the early 
part of the quarter.
The sustained momentum across our cold platform and food attach coupled with the return of winter favorites and 
newer offerings such as the Pistachio Latte all contributed to these strong results. Our average ticket continued to 
grow, reaching an all-time high driven by strategic beverage pricing and another record-breaking quarter of food 
attach with food sales increasing 25% from the prior year. We continue to engage with customers where and how 
they prefer as our drive-thru windows, Mobile Order, and delivery channels collectively accounted for 75% of US 
company-operated sales in Q2. These convenient order channels and compelling product offerings cannot be 
easily replicated at home.
Our customers continue to make Starbucks a part of their daily routine, fueling growth across all dayparts, in 
drive-thrus and cafes with specific strength in suburban and rural areas. Underpinning the enduring demand is our 
continued focus on digital customer engagement with Starbucks Rewards members delivering 54% of the 
revenue in our US company-operated stores, the highest level of engagement on record, up 2 percentage points 
from the prior year. North America's operating margin was 17.2% in Q2, contracting 260 basis points from the 
prior year due to inflation, investments in labor including enhanced store partner wages and new partner training, 
as well as the lapping of prior-year government subsidies. These margin headwinds were partially offset by 
pricing and sales leverage.
Throughout the quarter, we executed our plan to offset near-term margin pressures by accelerating price 
increases, reducing spend in discretionary cost areas, and activating throughput initiatives across our operations. 
These actions helped the company deliver Q2 profitability as planned despite higher than expected COVID 
isolation pay and ongoing inflationary headwinds which increased considerably over the course of the quarter. 
Moving on to international.
The segment delivered its highest second quarter revenue ever reaching $1.7 billion, up 4% over the prior year 
despite the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The growth was primarily driven by a 9% increase in net 
new stores over the past 12 months and strong sales growth from our international licensees including the 
conversion of our Korea market to a fully licensed business. Growth was partially offset by an 8% decline in 
comparable store sales including a 3% decline attributable to the lapping prior-year VAT benefit as well as a 3% 
unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
Excluding the VAT impact, international comparable store sales declined 5% and excluding China, international 
comparable store sales increased meaningfully. Shifting to China, as you're aware and as Belinda discussed, 
China continues to battle COVID resurgences and navigate through prolonged lockdowns. Although China's 
comparable store sales improved sequentially in January, traffic lessened considerably in February and March as 
Omicron cases surged and lockdowns were implemented leading to a comparable store sales decline of nearly 
50% in the last week of March as we exited the quarter.
As a result, second quarter comparable store sales declined 23% in the market or 20% excluding an impact of 
lapping the prior-year VAT relief. At the end of Q2, roughly one-third of our stores in China remained temporarily 
closed or offered Mobile Ordering channels only. A sizable number of these stores were high volume stores 
located in Tier 1 cities including Shanghai with the balance of active stores operating under elevated COVID

safety protocols. Despite the considerable near-term headwinds, we remain focused on executing against our 
growth strategy in China.
As Belinda shared, given our portfolio's healthy fundamentals, expanding digital footprint, and record customer 
connection, coupled with vast opportunity ahead, we remain very optimistic for our future growth in China. Outside 
of China, the recovery of our international markets gained momentum across our global portfolio in Q2 with many 
of our licensed markets achieving record revenue levels in the quarter with revenue growth for the segment 
outside of China reaching 23%, once again demonstrating the underlying health of our business as mobility 
restrictions subside.
Operating margin for the international segment was 13.1% in Q2, down 600 basis points from the prior year 
mainly driven by strategic and partner investments lapping higher prior-year COVID relief including government 
subsidies as well as higher product and distribution costs from sales mix shift partially offset by sales leverage 
across the P&L. Strong performance of our international market outside of China helped offset the significant 
sales deleverage in China.
As the adverse impact from China lockdowns intensified in the last few weeks of Q2 and amplified further as we 
entered Q3, we expect China's results to continue to be a headwind throughout the current quarter.
Moving on to channel development, the segment's revenue grew 25% to $463 million in Q2 primarily driven by 
growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as the strength in our international Ready-to-Drink business. The 
segment continued to amplify the Starbucks brand led by the growth of our US at-home coffee under the Global 
Coffee Alliance which continued to see strong performance driven by the Starbucks fine espresso platform fueled 
by the Vertuo line. We had exciting innovation launches in our Ready-to-Drink business including Starbucks 
BAYA Energy in the US and new chilled offerings in our international markets. The segment's operating margin 
was 42.7% in Q2, down 400 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to business mix shift driven by growth 
in the Global Coffee Alliance.
Moving on to our guidance for the balance of our fiscal 2022 year. Given the uncertainty around further mobility 
restrictions and lockdowns in China resulting from the government's strict zero COVID policies as well as 
increasingly inflationary headwinds, it's become increasingly difficult for us to predict the back half of the year with 
reasonable accuracy. Thus, as Howard mentioned, we believe the only responsible thing to do is suspend 
guidance for balance of this fiscal year. However, to provide additional insights we believe our results for the 
balance of the year will be significantly pressured with heavier pressure in Q3.
From a capital allocation perspective, although we suspended share repurchases for the balance of the fiscal 
year, we returned more than $5 billion between share repurchases and our quarterly dividend during the first half 
of our fiscal year. We expect share repurchases made earlier in the year to contribute at least 1% to our FY 2022 
EPS growth. We will provide a comprehensive update on our business outlook and our capital allocation 
commitments for FY 2023 and beyond at our Investor Day in September.
However, as Howard mentioned, we are confident the investments we are making in our partners, our stores and 
our brand will deliver significant returns in excess of historical levels resulting in accelerated long-term growth. To 
summarize, the two key takeaways from my prepared remarks today, our Q2 performance underscores the strong 
customer demand across our business and around the world. We remain committed to the growth opportunity 
ahead in all channels and markets, creating and delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders, our partners, 
our customers and our shareholders long into the future.

Once again, the real credit for our success belongs to our Green Apron partners around the world, who continue 
to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience every day. That experience drove our 
growth and will continue to be the heart of our business as we reimagine the future of Starbucks together.
With that, Howard, Belinda, Brady and I are happy to take your questions joined by John Culver, Michael Conway 
and Adam Brotman. Thank you. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sara H. Senatore
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Thank you very much. And welcome back, Howard. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the 
investments you're making. And I guess twofold. One is as you point out, Starbucks has been ahead of the curve 
on certainly on wages. So, is this about putting more hours in? I know you talked about training. I'm just trying to 
get a little bit more color on what that means. And in particular, if I look at your transactions in the US or North 
America, they're still down versus what we saw in prior to the pandemic. So just trying to get a sense of is it that 
these are more complex orders or how should we think about any color ahead of what you'll talk to us more about 
on September?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. Well, thank you, Sara. As I mentioned in my remarks, over the last few weeks, I pretty much have 
crisscrossed the country in meeting with Starbucks partners and really listening very carefully to their concerns, 
their suggestions, and what we really are calling a co-creation for the future of the company. I think, it's important 
to understand that the business as I mentioned has changed dramatically in terms of Mobile Order & Pay, cold 
beverages is now almost 80% of the business, and the equipment in our stores and the layout of the stores have 
not been designed for the way customers are using our stores today. And that has put enormous pressure on our 
people.
So, the first thing we must do is give them new tools, and there will be upgrades in equipment that will be 
sequentially brought into the stores to try and relieve them of the pressure. That's one investment on the 
equipment side. There will be a fair amount of investment in technology to do everything we can to upgrade the 
algorithms of labor scheduling. And there will be upgrades in the digital app itself to be able to provide customers 
with a more accurate method of when their beverage is going to be ready. And then there's the wage piece.
And I think as I said, we've always been ahead of the curve, but I think we haven't done enough. And I think we 
have to recognize that there is a lot of pressure on our people. We want to do everything we can, and so we're 
going to raise wages again. And I think, if you think about Starbucks, Starbucks has been probably 
quintessentially the most experiential brand over the last 20, 30 years. And that experience comes to life as –
because of the relationship that our people have with our customers. If we want to exceed the expectations of our 
customers, we have to exceed the expectations of our people.
And so, during COVID and post-COVID, our attrition rate like almost every other retailer has gone up significantly. 
If you look at where we can really be much more efficient is if we can provide our people with better training,

better wages, better equipment behind the counters, and give them the tools and the resources and the selfconfidence and the self-esteem to do their job. We will lower attrition and our retention rate will be much greater. 
That alone is a significant level of ways in which we can take money out of the P&L and money out of the store 
economics.
So, I mean, I think let me put it in my own language. I mean, you have to ask yourself, is Starbucks half empty or 
half full? Listen, Starbucks is completely half full. Look at the assets we have. Look at how many customers are 
reaching out to Starbucks every day. The demand is accelerating. And that's despite the fact that we're not doing 
our best. As I said in my remarks, just wait until we upgrade the system, upgrade wages, give our people the tools 
and confidence, and once again you're going to see us recording the kind of store level economics we have in the 
past. The other thing I'd say is that the inflationary issues which are significant and growing, that's an anomaly in 
America. We all know the inflation is a problem. But it's going to come down.
And the other issue is China. We are so well positioned in China for the future. And the China restrictions are 
going to abate. And there's no consumer brand that I can identify that is better positioned than we are to take 
advantage. And as I said in my remarks, the China business is going to be bigger than the US. So, is the glass 
half full? You bet it is.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy Barish
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q
Hey, Howard and team. Welcome back, Howard. Just a quick question on the areas of inflation that you're seeing 
now. I understand the future needs for equipment and training and wages. But where specifically are you seeing 
the inflation accelerating at this point if you could?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. Hey, Andy. Thanks for the question. It's Rachel. Our answer to that is as we talked about in Q2, we saw 
inflationary pressures elevate in Q2 versus Q1. And that was related to a number of factors, some of them 
COVID-related. But as we've seen going from Q2 and for the balance of the year, we're seeing increasing 
inflationary pressures across our supply chain both in labor as well as freight and then across our commodities. 
And I would say it's pretty equal half between commodities, half between our supply chain, with freight being the 
bigger factor of the issues in the supply chain. So that's what we're seeing continue to elevate.

Great. Thank you so much. Howard, appreciate the remarks. Very thorough and passionate. Obviously not to

talk a little about the pedigree and characteristics that you and the Board are looking for in your successor?

I want to be very careful because I want to be sensitive to the people we're talking to and be respectful of all the 
candidates. Obviously, we want someone who has domain cultural experience in terms of the sensitivity of the 
values and culture of Starbucks Coffee Company. That person really needs to understand what it means to put on 
a green apron and work behind the Starbucks counter and be able to enhance and preserve the culture and 
values that we hold so dear at Starbucks. That person needs to have global experience. We're a global company.
And obviously, we're looking for a servant leader and someone who is going to be here for the long-term. There is 
no shortage of people who would like this job, and I think the Board and I have been very encouraged by the fact 
that we've been able to talk to wonderful candidates, who really bring a lot to the table. But we're being very 
judicious and very careful, but we're going to find the right person. And I've committed to the Board that I will do 
everything I can to ensure a soft landing and good immersion, and then I'll stay on the Board to help the company 
and help the new CEO.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey A. Bernstein
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Great. Thank you very much, and welcome back, Howard. Just one clarification and then a question. The 
clarification I know you mentioned $200 million of incremental investment on the conference call. Yet I see the 
press release is talking about upwards of $1 billion for the fiscal year. So, I just wanted to reconcile whether the 
$1 billion is all inclusive of prior investments, as well as the $200 million. By the way, my question Howard was 
just as we look to fiscal 2023, it does seem like you're in somewhat of an unusual position kind of echoing the last 
question, returning as CEO, but expecting to hire a new CEO in the fall. I'm just wondering how do you walk that 
fine line stabilizing the business today, but being sensitive to not offering too much of a new strategy or making 
major structural changes, which I would think would be something the new CEO would be keen to establish. 
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. I'll let – I'll give Rachel the question on the investment first.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. Hey, Jeffrey. So, from an investment perspective, the more than $200 million that Howard shared in his 
prepared remarks, that's in relation to – we've already made investments this year and that's incremental to the 
investments we've already committed to this year. So, if you recall, we've already committed to investments on 
wage, some aspects of training, as well as labor. In addition to that, we're having another round of investments on 
top of that that will be related to further wage investments, but also modernizing our training and our collaboration 
as well as celebrating coffee and coffee excellence as well as some equipment and other innovation in our stores 
to help with overall store productivity and improving our store operations. So, the collective nature of that gets to 
about $1 billion in this year alone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
In terms of your question, I think it's a question that I've spoken to the Board about a fair amount to ensure the 
fact that the strategy that we are now engaged in and the investments that we are focused on are the right ones

regardless of who the next CEO is going to be. And I think, the lens in which we're making all these investments is 
100% through the lens of what can we do to exceed the expectations of both our customers and our people.
And if you look at the demand of Starbucks, the strategy is we are all focused on one thing right now, and that is 
to reimagine and rebuild and restore belief and trust with our people and do everything we can to rebuild the core 
US business post-COVID. So, I think any CEO that's going to come in is going to understand that the core 
business of Starbucks is under significant pressure primarily because of the demand we have. In addition to that, I 
think, the next CEO is going to be a creative person, who is going to understand that the equity of the Starbucks 
brand has real legitimacy and relevance outside of our stores. And in the world we're living in today, our customer 
base is getting younger, they're digital natives and they expect Starbucks to be as relevant outside of our stores 
as we are inside.
And what you heard Brady talk about and Adam's arrival here in terms of Web 3.0 and the NFT platform, the new 
CEO obviously needs to have an understanding and a grasp and a conviction on the fact that we can play in 
multiple theaters that could be accretive on their own merit and complementary to our retail business and if done 
really, really well and we think we can, can be a bounce back to creating incremental traffic and revenue not only 
in its core business in terms of retail, but a new business that's going to create incremental revenue unto itself.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Ivankoe
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi. Thank you. How are you, Howard? Obviously, the suspension of the share buyback is very symbolic, and it's 
something that you mentioned today and obviously got a lot of attention, when it was announced initially. And I 
am curious on CapEx that was previously guided at around $2 billion, you have $4 billion of cash. I mean, you 
have talked about some increased step-ups investments, but it's hard to see those investments even in fiscal 
2023 materially drawing down your cash. So, I just wanted to get a little bit more sense in terms of your highest 
returning cash that you can spend in your business as opposed to being given by shareholders. But was that 
really something that you wanted to do symbolically in terms of a message to the employees and the 
shareholders, or did you feel like that was something that you had to do financially because some of the capital 
needs and perhaps OpEx needs of the business going forward actually would draw into some of that cash that 
you have currently? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Well, John, first off, you and I are probably the oldest people on this call. For those of you who are not familiar 
with John's career, he's been with us I think since the IPO in 1992. So, John, I think you've seen this movie 
before. Listen, the decision to suspend the buyback was not symbolic. We're not making symbolic decisions. 
We're making strategic decisions that we think are in the best interest of our shareholders. And the investments
that we're currently making are going to drive a better return than the current way in which we look at buybacks, 
which is 10%, 11%.
And, for example, if we increase retention at 10%, 20%, the investments we're making are going to be 
significantly greater than that. You're right about the balance sheet, but I wanted to be very conservative, and I 
certainly wanted to send a signal to the market that we're playing the long game. We're not in it for the short run. 
We've always been – always embraced building a great enduring company. That's what we are today. Starbucks'

best days are ahead of us. We've never been more enthused, more proud, more optimistic, and this is the right 
decision to make. Rachel, do you want to add to it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. And if I can just add to that, the decision around suspending our buybacks was related to FY 2022. So, 
we'll come back at Investor Day in September and provide a more comprehensive capital allocation strategy for 
2023 and beyond. So, I think, it's important to consider that when you think about the decision we made. I also 
would say just to punctuate Howard's point is that we have the opportunity as we've looked at the back half of this 
year. Remember, that we've already repurchased $4 billion this year. And so, we've been able to between 
buybacks and dividends return about $5 billion to shareholders. So, we've leveraged that as a way to create 
value.
But as we look at the back half of this year and we look at the priority of our investments, what Howard talked 
about in his prepared remarks, investments in technology, investments in digital, investments in our stores, they 
all have an outsized return relative to what we can do with buybacks. Perfect example of that is you know very 
well our new stores and the return we see on our new stores. More recently we've seen our new stores in the US 
have an ROI of about 55%. So, we have a significant opportunity ahead of us as we think about really not only 
strengthening the business but creating more value over the long-term. And I think, you'll see a lot more about 
that at Investor Day in September.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Rachel, before we get another question, if you don't mind, Michael would you just take a few minutes because 
there's been a lot of chatter about China's impact on international and just give – I know you just got back from 
Japan and Korea. Just talk a little bit about your trip and international in general.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael A. Conway
Group President, International and Channel Development, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. Thanks, Howard. We're seeing very strong recovery across many of our international markets outside of 
China. As restrictions are starting to lift around the world, I was just in Japan and Korea, which is our number 
three and number four markets globally. And I can tell you customers are back out. They're starting to return to 
their routines and they're starting to return to our stores. In many of our key markets, Japan, Korea, the UK, 
Mexico, our average store sales are actually higher than our pre-COVID averages.
As you heard, our international market had strong rate of 23% when you exclude China. And we have strength 
across all the regions. Just so, for example, in Latin America where we just now – just achieved 1,500 stores, we 
had strong momentum and a system comp of more than 40% in Q2. In EMEA, our UK comps grew at 67% 
representing the highest comping company operated market in Q2. As traffic continues to come into central 
London, the metro areas, and we are increasing drive-thrus in that market in a significant rate.
In Asia-Pacific, year-over-year our revenue grew more than 50% with Korea leading the way. And then in Japan, 
our third largest market globally, we had double digit comps as customer engagements is increasing. And this is 
despite the fact that there was Omicron and lockdowns early in January and into February. And these markets are 
starting to ease restrictions. Korea just on Monday removed the mask mandates. And so customers are coming 
back to our stores. So, I'm excited about the growth potential in front of us as the recovery continues.

Our license partners are seeing the strength of our brand, they're committed to investing in our brands, as 
evidenced by the store growth that we're seeing. And then we have tremendous runway for growth when you 
think about the opportunity with the digital flywheel and we're working hard to expand that and to build loyalty and 
frequency with our global customers. So, we expect the international momentum to continue as more and more 
markets start to relax restrictions and customers will come back to Starbucks.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Garber
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Howard, if I could ask a question just on sort of the multichannel means in 
which consumers sort of interact with your brand now. You highlighted it in the call, but there's several different 
sort of service channels now that we think about when it comes to consumers coming into this rather themselves 
and then you've got the high penetration, so you said about 80% of sales which is Delivery, drive-thru, or from 
Mobile Order & Pay. Can you help frame maybe how you're thinking about the Starbucks of the future and how 
maybe the actual in-store operations will shift from how they are today to serve that multichannel need? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Thank you. I'll give that to Brady. Go ahead, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Brewer
Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp. A
Hello, Jared. Yeah. We're really looking at this and asking ourselves three questions. One is on the foundation of 
the Starbucks experience, which is us knowing our customers by name, knowing their favorite drink, we're asking 
ourselves how can we do that in the digital space, knowing every single customer, personalizing the experience, 
and then making that experience absolutely effortless for the customer. Increasingly that's what customers are 
seeking. An effortless, personalized, human connection at Starbucks. And so, we're seeing that play out in the 
drive-thru. We're seeing that in our delivery growth, as Howard mentioned, growing 30% year-over-year.
And with MOP now 25% of our business, obviously we're seeing that there. So, it's about how does Starbucks 
unlock that magic connection which only Starbucks can between connection and convenience. And because 
we've been successful with that so far, that's why we're seeing customers adopt those channels so quickly and so 
holistically. But I'd say we're just getting started.

a high level is still a reinvestment year in the business? And you made a comment about seeing returns in excess

of historical levels over time. I wasn't sure if that was a comment that you believed that ultimately margins could 
achieve or exceed your historical goals of 18% to 19% or what does that comment broadly mean about excess 
returns versus historical levels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. I can speak to the more than $200 million that Howard shared in his prepared remarks is relative to FY 
2022. In terms of what we're expecting for FY 2023 and FY2024, we have near-term pressure in our business. 
And that's between the pressure we're seeing with inflation as well as what we're seeing in China and then the 
investments we're choosing to make. But while we're seeing near-term pressure, we have line of sight to a very 
solid path of accelerated growth in the future, and we're excited to share that with you at Investor Day. So, at 
Investor Day, we'll provide more about our business, as well as our broader more comprehensive capital 
allocation strategy for 2023 and beyond.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
I think just to pick up on that, we have been a growth company. We believe that Starbucks will maintain our 
position as a growth company and given the demand we have and the capacity restraints, it really says we should 
be opening more stores. So, I think, you're going to see our Investor Day, which we're very enthused to move up 
from December to September. We want to accelerate growth.

Lauren Silberman
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Q
Hi. Thanks for the question. So, Starbucks is well regarded as one of the best companies with leading comp and 
benefits. Very front-footed in terms of investment. Howard, as you've spoken to partners across the US, is 
sentiment towards the brand differ across markets or based on the tenor of the employees? Can you just talk 
about the differing factors there or partners relatively consistent in what they're looking for?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Because we are in a situation where anything we say or might say can be misinterpreted by outside attorneys that 
are trying to find ways in which Starbucks is at fault, I want to be very careful here. My prepared remarks need to 
be what we're going to say regarding the union issues. My comments and the emotional relationship that I had in 
these meetings with partners across the country were really quite extraordinary. The love that people have for the 
company, the challenges that they've had personally and professionally as a result of COVID, the responsibility 
that they feel Starbucks has, which we agree with to do everything we can to make their life better. But I don't 
want to go any further than that because I think the investments we're going to make for our people is a method to 
do everything we can to exceed their expectations, and we'll speak more about that in September.
And I just want to say we're moving up the Investor Day from December to September because we are quite 
enthused and excited to kind of move it up and share with you our plans for the future, accelerated growth, new 
store ideas, the technology, all the things we're going to share with you, including the relationship that we'll have 
with our people. And I think just thinking out loud, I think we should have some of our people who are tenured 
managers of Starbucks and tenured Green Apron partners there to talk to you about their experience with the 
company, which I think you'll find quite interesting.

Analyst, BTIG LLC Q
Great. Thank you for taking the question. Howard, you mentioned additional wage increases and investments. But 
you also mentioned some enhanced tipping options that are coming. Can you talk about that decision and maybe 
the timing and what you expect the consumer response to that to be?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. I'll have Brady help me out. The digital tipping opportunity is perhaps the number one single issue to provide 
more cash in the hands of our people. Right now, the only way our people can get a tip is on the Starbucks card. 
And so, they're missing out on a significant amount of money because customers want to give them a cashless 
tip, but don't have the ability to do it because they're not paying on the Starbucks card. That has been one of the 
most requested opportunities from our partners in the meetings I've had around the country. And this is something 
we're going to accelerate as much as we can.
Brady, do you want to take the other piece?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Brewer
Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. So, yeah, I mean, I think on the tipping side of things, we're adding functionality throughout the year. We've 
got a lot of people working on this. As Howard said, it's one of the top requests. Currently a customer can tip 
using the MOP experience, but we don't have the ability in many other parts of our store experience when a 
person is paying with a credit card, a store value card, or the app in our cafe and in the drive-thru. So that's what 
we anticipate working very quickly against to bring that functionality to our partners.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
And if I could just add on the wage, the majority of the wage investments that Howard talked about just specific to 
wage were part of what we already committed to earlier this year. But in addition to that, as we made the move on 
wage for the majority of our hourly partners, our baristas, we've also committed to addressing compression and 
tenure in this most recent move as well. So that will mean that every one of our partners will also have an 
increase this summer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
And then to just repeat that. Every Starbucks person who is a non-manager at Starbucks will be getting an 
increase in pay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
That's right.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David E. Tarantino
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Q
Hi. Good afternoon. And welcome back, Howard. Howard, I guess my first question or first part of the question is 
a clarification. You mentioned over $200 million of investments have been identified. And that seems a little small 
in relation to kind of your ambitious vision about transforming the company. So can you clarify whether that's just 
a starting point and you have more in mind or whether that's the total of what you're thinking?
And then secondly, I guess if there's any directional commentary you can offer about what the longer-term margin 
outlook might look like including these investments, relative to the prior targets the company had before your 
return. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp. A
Sure. I think given the investment question, I'll give it to Rachel. In terms of the margin question, I think that's 
Rachel as well. But clearly the inflationary number which is quite stiff is going to abate. And when it does, we'll be 
in a great position because we will have done things to handle the demand, which we're having trouble doing 
now. But Rachel, go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rachel Ruggeri
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. Let me just speak to the more than $200 million that Howard addressed in his prepared remarks is on top 
of the commitments we'd already made earlier this year largely related to wage. So the combination of that is 
about $1 billion in this year alone. And so certainly we'll have further investments that we'll make over time that 
we'll share with you at Investor Day. But I think it's important to remember that's a little more than $200 million on 
top of the commitments we've already made. So it's a pretty big broad investment when you look at it from that 
perspective. And relative to margins, I think as Howard spoke about, we expect that some portion of inflation will 
essentially abate.
In addition to that, I think what's really important and the pressure we're seeing in the back half of the year is that's 
largely pressure from what we're seeing in China and the amplification in Q3. And just to give you a perspective, 
what we're projecting for the balance of the year is that typically – what we typically see from China in terms of 
market contribution on OI will be half of what we typically expect. As the market returns and mobility increases, 
we know that the growth rhythm there is strong. We believe in the opportunity ahead, and that will also give us 
further opportunity as we think about that into the future.
But I think when you think about those two aspects and the investments we're making today, that we'll return 
investments in retention, investments in recruiting, investments in our ability to make our store operations 
improved, that's going to lead to greater partner engagement, and partner engagement leads to better customer 
experience overall. We know that equation. It's worked for us for 50 years. It's going to be the key to what we 
deliver over the next 50 years and it's critical to our growth. So I think the combination of all of that gives us line of 
sight to the fact that we firmly believe we'll be able to have a path to accelerated growth in the future which we'll 
share with you at Investor Day.

Sharon Zackfia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hi. Good afternoon. I guess a question on the unmet demand that you're seeing in North America or specifically 
the US. Can you talk about kind of where your measures of productivity or throughput are relative to prepandemic particularly given the barista turnover that you've seen?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Culver
Group President, North America and Chief Operating Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah, Sharon. This is John. I think what we're seeing is that as we get our stores operating at full capacity and as 
we come through COVID early in the quarter, we have now increased hours of operation. And at the same time, 
also increased to full staffing levels in our stores and having all channels open. So we're getting a much better 
read on how our productivity is progressing.
Clearly, we measure on drive-thru out the window time. Clearly in the stores we measure items sold per labor 
hour, and there are other measurements that we track as well. We watch all those things very closely. I think one 
of the things I would just also highlight on the investments we're making for the remainder of this year is a big 
investment on training for our partners.
And one of the things that we heard loud and clear in these listening session and co-creation sessions was they 
wanted more training. And today we offer about 23 hours of training to a new barista entering our stores, and 
we're going to push that to 40 hours beginning the end of June. And that will significantly enhance their skill-sets, 
make them more confident in preparing the beverages and ultimately make them feel successful, reducing overall 
complexity of doing the job and ultimately feeling successful.
So ultimately, we do feel that will help increase productivity, but it's all about enhancing that partner experience, 
giving them the tools that they need to be successful, and making sure that we're investing in them. And then 
you've got the equipment aspects as well. We've got significant investments that we're making around the 
Mastrena machines, around the Merry Chef ovens, around handheld order points for drive-thru, and also the 
investments we're going to make on the cold beverage station to increase the capacity of the cold beverage work 
area for our partners going forward, which will help improve productivity as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Palmer
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q
Thanks. Welcome back, Howard. I think John was actually touching on the question I was going to ask about, 
which is around capacity constraints. I'm wondering if you can maybe touch on what you're seeing in terms of 
service times or anything. Any metrics that would sort of prove to you that there's an opportunity or room for 
improvement?
And I got a sense from your answer just then and before that you think a lot of this is going to be solved more on 
the capital investment side with new machines, for example, and sort of reconfiguring how the cold beverage area 
works. But do you think there's also going to be more expensed type investment, labor, you mentioned the people 
with the handhelds in the drive-thru. Any sort of breakdown of how you see this investment playing out? Thanks.

John Culver
Group President, North America and Chief Operating Officer, Starbucks Corp. A
Yeah. What we'll see is we'll see an investment from an expense standpoint on obviously training which I 
highlighted earlier which we think will have significant positive impact for our partners and making them better 
prepared to do their jobs. Number two, the equipment investments although those will be capitalized, they will 
also have some expense as we go through and do installations. When we do the renovations in the stores, that 
portion would be capitalized. Although there will be some expense allocation to that as well. And then Howard and 
Rachel have touched on some of the digital investments we want to make in the stores not only for customers but 
for partners.
And from a partner standpoint, it's all around automating the ordering system. We have automated ordering rolled 
out completely across the US for our food and merchandise. We're in proof-of-concept testing right now for 
beverage items in the remainder of the items, and we anticipate that that will also be an unlock to help improve 
the partner experience, to reduce complexity, and to allow our partners to focus on our customers.
And then the last thing I would just say as it relates to the productivity measures. We believe very strongly that as 
we've come through COVID, we experienced significant challenges on staffing stores. And as we progressed 
through the quarter in Q2, and as COVID eased, staffing levels normalized, hours of operation began normalizing 
as well, and all channels were open.
Productivity began coming back into the stores, and that was signified by the strong performance from a comp 
perspective that we saw in the quarter to deliver a 12% comp as well as see the increase of attach of food at 
record levels signifies that our partners are doing heroic work to meet the demand of the customers and what 
they're seeing in their stores. And I just want to acknowledge all our partners across the US for their tremendous 
job they're doing to exceed those expectations of our customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Howard Schultz for closing remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Howard D. Schultz
Chief Executive Officer, Interim, Starbucks Corp.
I guess this is my opportunity to close the call. Our intent today was to provide a comprehensive overview of what 
we've done in the last five, six weeks. And also to give you a sense of the passionate enthusiasm and optimism 
we have about the future of the company. Clearly there are things that are not in our control right now. The 
situation in China, the level of inflation are things that we didn't plan on that we're managing through.
But when you take inflation out and you take the problems in China out, both of which we believe are going to 
abate, we're going to be really well positioned to take advantage of the position we occupy in the marketplace. 
And that is from a global perspective. You heard Michael tell you how strong our business is in international 
excluding China.
You heard me talk about the strength of our CPG business, which demonstrates the strength of our brand outside 
of our stores. The other thing which I did not mention is one of the metrics that I've always been concerned about 
was whether or not our customer base was getting younger, that we were staying as relevant as possible with 
young people. That's exactly where we are. Our customer base is getting younger. And that to me says so much 
about the strength of the brand in terms of our 50-year history.

And so as we head into the summer and holiday season and the investor conference, I think we're going to be 
well positioned to really share with you the plans we have for holiday and fiscal 2023 and beyond. For those of 
you who have known me a long time and many of you have followed the company for many years, you were 
around in 2008.
Now, this is not 2008. But when I came back in 2008, one of the main issues was we had to create demand. We 
didn't have demand. And so the demand that we right now is such a blessing and such a gift, and so what we 
have to do is harness the issues that we have to deal with in terms of capacity and exceeding the expectations of 
our people. I've been here long enough to understand what the challenges are and long enough to understand the 
extraordinary opportunity Starbucks has in the marketplace domestically and around the world.
We have challenges but we have the experience and the know-how to address them and most importantly we're 
taking the long – we're playing the long game. We're making the investments ahead of the curve and we are 
going to accelerate growth and for those investors who had faith in us in 2008, I hope that you'll understand the 
glass is clearly half full, and we're going to be back to where we always have been and that is delivering the kind 
of financial results that you've come to expect from us. Thank you very much.

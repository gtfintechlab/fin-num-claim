MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining Atlassian's Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of 
Fiscal 2020. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the 
Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call.
I will now hand the call over to Matt Sonefeldt, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations.

Matthew Sonefeldt
Vice President-Investor Relations, Atlassian Corp. Plc
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Atlassian's third quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. 
Thank you for joining and supporting us. On the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott 
Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Financial Officer, James Beer; and our President, Jay Simons.
Earlier today, we issued a press release and a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for 
our third quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's 
website. On our IR site, we also posted a supplemental presentation and data sheet. During the call, we'll make 
brief opening remarks, and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.
Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements 
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.
Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such 
statements are made. And we disclaim any obligations to update or revised them should they change or cease to 
be updated. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results are 
included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section 
titled Risk Factors in our most recent 20-F and Quarterly Report on Form 6-K.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. These non-IFRS financial measures 
are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance 
with IFRS. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-IFRS financial measures versus their 
nearest IFRS equivalents, and may be different from non-IFRS and non-GAAP measures used by other 
companies. A reconciliation between IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures is available in our earnings release, 
our shareholder letter, and in our updated investor data sheet on our IR website.
During Q&A, please ask your full question upfront so that we can easily move through to the next speaker. Also, 
please be patient if you encounter any disruptions [indiscernible] (00:02:31) given we are individually dialing in 
from our homes across the world.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for opening remarks.

Thanks, everyone, for joining today and for your continued support. We want to start by saying we hope you and 
your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are in unprecedented times. It's more important than ever that we 
embrace our mission to unleash the potential of every team and support our staff, customers and community. As 
you've hopefully read in our shareholder letter, we are confronting this crisis head-on. Rapid economic change 
shakes up industry leader boards, and we will continue to position Atlassian to drive long-term growth in the 
coming quarters and years.
We will leverage our resilient culture and the strength of our business model to take share in the massive markets 
that we serve. Over nearly two decades, we've learned to navigate and adapt to macro change. While we plan to 
play offense in this cycle, we also acknowledge that the macro economy present some serious headwinds. Here 
in Q3, our performance was unscathed. We posted strong results with 33% year-over-year revenue growth, 6,200 
net new customer additions, and solid profitability. At the same time, the reality of serving over 170,000 customers 
means we have exposure to the small business economy in COVID-impacted industries. We provided much more 
detail and many other updates in our shareholder letter that was issued earlier today. We are committed to 
emerging stronger from this storm, and our culture will help us to set our direction.
Before we move to questions, we want to thank our employees for demonstrating incredible resilience and 
adaptability in becoming a fully remote team under pressure. It has been difficult, and your hard work has never 
been more important as we support millions of teams across the world.
With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A.

Yeah, we can hear you fine, man.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jack Andrews
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question, and glad to hear everyone is doing well in this environment. 
Yeah, I want to ask something about the – something in your shareholder letter. You mentioned that I think 23% 
of your attendees from your recent remote summit came from your business teams, which was essentially double 
from 2019. I was wondering if you could just talk about what is really accounting for that increase there, whether 
there's something that's happening organically or whether you've pivoted your marketing message. And then the 
second question would just be any early feedback on the new Cloud Enterprise product. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, I'll take the first one. I think it's just an indication of the continued interest in how broad our products can be 
deployed and the diverse set of audiences they serve. I mean, remote summit lowered the barrier to entry to 
summit. So, could be that there are a lot of interests from a line of business participants on our product and users 
of our product that may not want to travel all the way to San Francisco for an event, but we made it far easier for 
them to join an event meet, birds-of-a-feather, and I think that's something that we'll continue to explore going 
forward. And I think Michael will take the Enterprise Cloud (sic) [Cloud Enterprise] (00:08:06) question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure, [indiscernible] (00:08:10). Look, Cloud Enterprise, to those who don't know, is our latest edition of our cloud 
products that we have launched at a summit a few weeks ago. It's certainly been one our most important and 
challenging initiatives in R&D over the last few years. It does give us a full light on those cloud editions to meet 
any customer size, if you can, free standard, premium, and now Enterprise with, of course, access for identity and 
content management across the set. That Enterprise edition helps us meet the needs of, obviously, the largest 
and most complex enterprises that want unlimited scalability, data residency, their complex security needs that 
come to that, et cetera. Those are obviously extremely hard to build to meet those requirements, and those 
requirements are incredibly important for the largest enterprises in the world if they move to the cloud.
We obviously had a very good reception to that announcement of the early access program at summit. We don't 
expect it to be a material contributor in FY 2020 or even in FY 2021 as we get those larger customers ramped up. 
But obviously, in the long-term, it's an incredibly important initiative. In terms of existing feedback from those large 
enterprises that have joined the early access program, it's been very good. Obviously, we spent a lot of time with 
them before that, making sure that we were building what it was that they wanted, and it's just a validation that 
we're on the right track with that edition.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.

Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. You guided slightly below the Street for next quarter and commented that 
COVID would impact fourth quarter more than current quarter [indiscernible] (00:10:20) quarter. I was wondering 
if you could speak a little bit more specifically about where COVID, in the emerging recession, will specifically 
impact the business. You mentioned SMB, for example, you mentioned COVID impacted industries, so I was 
wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that calculation.
And my follow-up question would be what you think the impact of all this will be on the pace of software 
development projects being rolled out, and if developer are hiring and how that might impact you guys in the next 
12 months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Michael, it's Scott here. I'll talk to the broader theme, and James can talk about the fiscal impact. As you all know, 
we have 171,000 customers around the world, everything from Fortune 10 to most of the Fortune 500 and tens of 
thousands. We talk about the Fortune 500,000 thing market [indiscernible] (00:11:18) we do. And we have no 
specific customer concentration. No one customer makes up more than 1% of our revenue, so there's not sort of 
a specific area there. But, of course, as you expect from such a broad market, that we're exposed in the same 
way that you would be kind of across all the different geographies and industries that we're in.
I do think there is a sort of short-term benefit of people using our products in terms of the work from home aspect. 
They're using collaboration tools more in the short-term. I think, in the long-term, the aspect is that people are 
going to work remotely more than they have [indiscernible] (00:11:58). Today, that's going to require more 
collaboration tools, whether that is collaborating on work product in Confluence, whether that is managing more 
[indiscernible] (00:12:08) versus talking to the person next to them at a desk. So, we see that there's some benefit 
for that over the long-term. In terms of pace of software development and hiring, I think we're six weeks into this, 
will be too hard to talk about that. As a broad industry trend, we haven't seen anything that makes us significantly 
[indiscernible] (00:12:30) we believe internally about that.
James, do you want to talk to any of the specific financial in place there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Thanks, Scott. Yes, as we've said, pleased that really a negligible impact from COVID-related factors in Q3. 
We have seen some impact in April. And the fact that we serve such a highly diverse set of customers really 
across all business sizes, geographies and industries is really one of our major business model advantages. And 
the reality of that is when you're serving that many customers, we are going to have exposure to the small 
business economy and to those particular set that have been particularly impacted by COVID now. Of course, this 
is reflected in the guide, and I would particularly emphasize that that guide underpins some very beneficial 
aspects of our revenue model. Recall that over 90% of our revenue comes from existing customers, and indeed 
over 85% of our revenue is recurring in nature. So, overall, we're pleased with how the business performed in Q3, 
feel like the guide reflects the impact of the coming quarter.

Arjun Bhatia
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in the shareholder letter that cloud migrations were up 
60% this year. How do you think the pace of those migration plays out of the rest of the year given we're in a bit 
more of an uncertain environment and maybe IT departments are a little busier just trying to keep the lights on? 
And sort of related to that, we'd just like to hear some early feedback that you're hearing from the Cloud 
Enterprise program that you launched.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure [indiscernible] (00:14:52) I can certainly crack that. Look, in terms of migrations, let me start there, we 
continue to monitor obviously how that will be affected. I wouldn't say we've seen much of an effect other than the 
normal growth in migration so far. It's probably worth noting, the larger you are as a company, it's obviously a 
large IT transformation project. But once you've moved to the cloud, you have reduced impact in terms of the 
operational load on your own team. Effectively, Atlassian takes care of a lot of things that you would have taken 
care of yourself. So, depending on your increased workload in a COVID environment, it can actually reduce your 
workload quite significantly as an IT department to let us handle a lot of the bits and pieces; and that obviously as 
you get smaller down the chain, that can be more pronounced if you're a 500-user customer or 100-user 
customer. So, we remain vigilant as to how that will affect the growth we've seen in migrations, which has been 
really good so far. It's worth noting that's been increased by the release of the Jira Cloud Migration Assistant, 
which is a tool we [ph] showed (00:16:04) during the last quarter that allows Jira users, predominantly Jira 
Software and Jira Service Desk, to pick up and move their data to the cloud much more easily, and so it helps you 
through a lot of more complex transition work. And that's obviously increased both the pace and the accuracy of 
those migrations, which has been really good.
From the Cloud Enterprise perspective, don't have a lot to add to what I said before. Obviously, the early reaction 
to the [indiscernible] (00:16:36) from customers who joined it has been very good, largely along the lines of, this is 
the edition we're looking for, this checks a lot of the boxes that we made from the highest and most demanding 
customers with good scale, performance and security requirements. We'll move into assessment mode and have 
a look at this, and we're working together with those early access program customers to make sure that Cloud 
Enterprise continue to evolve to meet their needs.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, as you know, we have a very thoughtful and rigorous process to considering pricing moves, and we've been 
doing that for some years now. When you think about what we've done in years past, it's been a balance between 
lowering prices and in some instances raising prices. And to layer on top of that as well, important to think about 
the editions strategy that we've been pursuing in recent times. So, now, with the rollouts fully of the free editions 
of Jira Software, Confluence and Jira Service Desk, that complements the standard editions, the premium 
editions. And as Mike was speaking about earlier, now we're beginning to roll out the enterprise editions as well. 
So, the editions represent another way in which we can be paid for the incremental value that we're offering a 
particular customer, that our customers able to align their needs with the right edition. And so, that will be an 
ongoing part of our strategy in the years ahead.
And then, in terms of specific price, we'll always obviously be thinking through all of the different relevant factors, 
both competitively and relevant to our customers. So, we'll always be looking to find the right balance between 
being compensated for the value that we offer to our customers while being cognizant of doing the right thing for 
our customer set as well. So, we'll keep having that perspective around pricing, and we'll update you in the 
months ahead.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co. Q
Hi. Thanks. That's a new way to pronounce my name. This is Rishi Jaluria from D. A. Davidson. Thanks for taking 
my question, guys. First wanted to appreciate the commentary, that more resilient model because 90% of 
revenue comes from existing customers. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more into that. If we were to kind of 
take a snapshot of any given year, how do we think directionally of new business within a year? How much comes 
from existing versus new? And following up on that, if you were to think about your penetration within your 
existing customer base, I'm sure you're pretty underpenetrated right now. But directionally, what do you think that 
opportunity just within the existing customer set looks like? And I have got a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Well, certainly we've noted that 90% of our activity – of our revenue each quarter comes from our current 
customers, so we tend to add a lot of new customers each quarter. Q3 was another example of a very nice 
number for additional customers, but those tend to represent a relatively small proportion of the dollars that we

generate each quarter. So, it's very much the bulk of the dollars coming from our expand motion and, of course, 
we have a variety of ways in which to expand across products, across editions that I was just referring to in the 
earlier question in terms of expanding across a broader part of that customers serving more of the groups at that 
customer and so forth. And so, we routinely talk about the fact that we believe we're early in our work to address 
these very large markets that we serve. So, we continue to be very focused on the long-term opportunity, and 
very confident about our ability to address that real opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rishi N. Jaluria
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co. Q
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. You can talk a little bit about the guidance of the SMB 
side of the equation, but I wanted to think about industry exposure, right, obviously you're very well diversified 
across industries, but if you were to think about just your exposure, again directionally, to some of the more 
impacted industries like travel, hospitality, retail, energy, just want you to give us a sense for how big that 
exposure looks. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Again, we really cover all industries, all sizes of companies, and all geographies. That's one of our terrific 
business model strengths. And so, yes, we obviously serve some of the companies like in the travel sector that 
have been particularly hard hit in the last several weeks. But really the focus of where we've seen an impact is on 
the smaller-sized company end of the spectrum. In fact, it was notable to me how one of the larger, for us, deals 
of March was with an important travel services company. The deal took a few more days to close, and actually 
rolled into the early part of April. But at the end of the day, I was very comfortable with the terms that we settled 
upon, and the customer was very appreciative of the fact that we had worked with them to help them through that 
particularly difficult time.
On the smaller end of the spectrum, obviously that's where we have more of our cloud customers. Recall that 
we've spoken now a couple of quarters ago about the [indiscernible] (23:44) we have more than 125,000 cloud 
customers out of our total of most recent figure today reported 171,000. So, we do skew in our cloud business to 
a smaller size of organization. Taking a step back from that more broadly, I'd say we're holding steady across the 
enterprise and large enterprise portions of our business. And on the cloud side, going back there for one last 
thought, I've been pleased [indiscernible] (00:24:19) while, as I say, there are some customers there who are 
seeing an impact. I've been very pleased by the number of new cloud customers who've been coming to us both 
in the month of March and thus far in April. In fact, March was the strongest month for Q3 for the addition of new 
cloud customers; and of course, that's lining up with a month in which we had fully rolled out our free offerings as 
well. So, really quite encouraged by the developments there in terms of continuing to attract new cloud 
customers.

Hey there. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping to hear more around the decision to play offense here in this 
backdrop. It sounded pretty clear in the letter that you're planning to keep pace in terms of hiring and play offense 
here in the coming months. Could you just spend a little more time in terms of what that means from your 
perspective? Are there any specific areas you see yourself maybe pushing even a bit faster behind? And are any 
of those impacts showing up here in the free cash flow guide which saw somewhat of a reduction here as well? 
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Michael, let me take that from this side, and Scott or James can jump in. I think we felt it was really 
important in line with our values. So, one of our company values is [indiscernible] (00:25:55), we wanted to be 
very clear with investors and partners about how we were approaching the current environment, which is 
obviously unusual. It's not business as usual at the moment. And I think, as a company, you have to choose a 
long-term strategic path with very clear thought as to why one is choosing that path because this is going to play 
out over many, many quarters.
When we sit down and think about Atlassian strengths, besides the fact that we are in very large markets, we 
have a capability to actually gain share through these quarters of turbulence however they come at us, and we'll 
remain very adaptable and thoughtful about them. Our culture is extremely strong and adaptable. Obviously, our 
go-to-market models, you're presumably well familiar with, suits the flexibility of these type of environments. We 
don't have to get on a lot of planes to solve that. And we have product innovation and we have an extremely 
strong obviously financial position in terms of generating free cash flow, as well as obviously the cash we have on 
the balance sheet in the business and the stability of our revenue streams.
So, I think when you put all that together, it's hopefully show some of the background why we feel confidence to 
take that strategy as we sell into the coming quarters and years about how we are planning to approach that and 
why we are choosing to communicate that.
Scott, maybe do you want to go into a little bit about the actual effects of what that mean? You listed 
[indiscernible] (00:27:35).

would hopefully consider ourselves still fairly young in the business, and we've been running Atlassian since it 
started in the dot-com crash in 2001 and we're in the global financial crisis in 2008, 2009 pretty clearly. Some of 
the things we did back then and what we're doing now is picking up great key hires and talent that's available, and 
that we could – maybe wouldn't be on the market otherwise. So, that's doing well.
Customer acquisition, we've – 12 years ago now, we've really seen [indiscernible] (00:28:16) licenses and 
reduced our price from $1,000 down to $10 for many of our products. A few months ago, we launched free, and 
those in free effectively took that $10 down to $0 to aggressively try to acquire customers. And also I think that 
increased products innovation and continuing the R&D investments that we are known for, and yield great value 
for our customers. And if there's any opportunistic M&A that turns up, we're not necessarily going hunting for it, 
but like there's often opportunities in this particular market environment where you can pick up things that are very 
attractive that otherwise, again, wouldn't be available. So, all those things, we're considering and we're discussing 
in a weekly basis in terms of how to be more opportunistic in these times. James can talk to you how that flows 
into free cash flow guidance.

James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. On the guide, I would just observe, obviously we've laid out our revenue guide. The free cash flow guide is 
directionally consistent with that. But then also, from a working capital perspective, I expect to say that we are 
working with a small subset of our customers who requested help in these extremely challenging macroeconomic 
times. Now, this is a relatively small proportion of our total customer base, less than 0.5%, but we feel that's the 
right thing to do, and it's an illustration again of the long-term orientation that Scott might have been talking about 
on this call already, just another illustration of that mindset that will work out well for those companies and well for 
us.

Ittai Kidron
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thanks. Good numbers, guys. I guess I wanted to follow up on a couple things. First of all, with respect to the free 
cloud additions, great to see that out, maybe you can tell us on how many downloads that already have or any 
statistics that you can have there that helps us understand uptake interest, level of interest, or conversion rate, 
anything on that front. And I know it's early, but some color would be appreciated.
And then for James, on the perpetual license revenue decline, clearly I'm assuming this is demand related, but 
maybe it can help me think about that in the context of how much of that was perhaps customers shifting to cloud 
versus to reflection of softer business activity. And would I – should I assume that that also is the main area 
where, in respect to your guidance, that's where we see most of the weakness near-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:31:21) I can certainly try to talk about the question. It's good to see [indiscernible] 
(00:31:25). Look, [indiscernible] (00:31:29) still very early, right? The results are incredibly encouraging for we 
started rolling out our free edition stuff in October in a very limited sense [indiscernible] (00:31:44) so, we're 
looking at 5% and 10% of [indiscernible] (00:31:47) seeing what the effects were. Overall, we're very thoughtful 
with how they impacted changes we make to [indiscernible] (00:31:51) and try to consider the long-terms benefits 
of that. We've certainly expanded them. Obviously, with COVID in the current process, we decided to accelerate 
that somewhat and rolled it out fully in March, which is now available for Jira Software, Jira Service Desk and 
Confluence. Obviously, that's alongside Trello and Bitbucket and other products that already had free editions 
next to a large part of their model already in the cloud.
The results of that have been currently encouraging so far. We can say, for March, we've had a 125% uplift in 
valuations, which is obviously actually a little bit ahead of where we expected, but is looking really very positive 
from that perspective. I would reiterate, it is extremely early. We did that – I believe it's less than four weeks ago 
now, little less than four weeks ago. So, I did expect a pop off of off the bat, and then it settled down to a number, 
but it's extremely in a good part in terms of where we think it should be. And we had seen limited evidence so far, 
I would say, but certainly some evidence that it is helping us get into even more markets in which users we would

not otherwise have been able to get to, which is our goal of heading towards the Fortune 500,000, so it's a great 
step on that particular journey. Just reiterating, the long-term [indiscernible] (00:33:22) and this is a great step on 
that journey.
James, I don't know if you want to take any financial impacts of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. Well, I'll speak to the license part of the question in particular. First of all, recall that in Q2, so 90 days ago, 
we reported quite a significant pull-forward effect that was driven by the price increases that we had announced 
previously. So, what we saw in part in Q3 was the effect of having activity that otherwise would have occurred in 
Q3 actually get pulled forward into Q2.
Now, a second point that's really important though, is that – and as we've been talking about this theme now for a 
number of quarters, is that we're very much orienting our business towards continuing to grow to subscription 
revenue business such as the cloud business and the data center business. So, you saw subscription revenue 
growth which is 7% year-over-year. Very much subscription, the primary driver of the revenue line for the 
company now. And I would expect that that will continue, and that commensurately you'll continue to see license 
moderating over time. In fact, recall that the license line now is a relatively small one. It's a small component of 
our overall revenue structure. So this past quarter, the absolute dollar figure is $21 million. So, I would continue to 
expect that we'll see less license activity over time and more subscription revenue growth.

Hi. This is Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to double click on the 
60% increase in migrations from server to cloud. Just wondering how do you measure that. Is that based on 
users, customers, revenue, et cetera? As you saw that uptick this fiscal year, what trend will you see out of the 
covers in terms of customer sizes moving from server to cloud? Did you guys take advantage in more upsell?
And lastly, what has been the partner feedback on migration tools that got launched couple of months back. As 
customers move from manual migration to more automated migration, are we talking about significant decrease in 
the final migration maybe from months or weeks or whatever you're saying. Would love to get – to hear from you 
guys. Thank you so much.

So Nikolay, I can start off, and perhaps, some of my colleagues will jump in as well. But in terms of your first part 
of the question, the migration statistics that we mentioned per service cloud activity, that driven off the user 
account. And in terms of our customer size that is migrating, what we are seeing is that step by step, as we 
continue to add more capability to our cloud product, as we continue to roll out and increase the capability of the 
different additions that we've been talking about on this call, then we're seeing more larger companies making 
that move. And I think we'll continue to see this trend play out that way over the coming years. Mike spoke earlier 
to the rollout of enterprise editions. So now, we're in a position where we can address the needs of any customer 
size. And I was going to refer to the helpfulness of those migration tools before you added it to your question. I 
think that has been an important aspect of us continuing down this pathway of making it easier for our customers 
of all sizes to migrate their path.
Jay, over to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I'll just jump on, Nikolay, with the back part of the question. I mean, the migration tools are built both for 
customers that can migrate without partner systems, also for partners to basically enable a better, more reliable 
migration. And remember, like in the partner case, there's a bunch of work that they're going to do around the 
migration that doesn't involve just moving data from server to cloud. In many cases, they want to reconsider their 
workflow. They want to reconsider how their projects are structured. So, we've taken the work out of basically 
moving data from point A to point B. But in point B, they have an opportunity to rethink what they really want to do 
or how they want to change the product. In many cases, the server customers have been using the server product 
for five or six years. And so, there may be some calcification that they want to partner to help them move past. 
And I think we're going to measure that just in terms of velocity over time, like constantly both with the partner and 
with the customer directly, we want to make sure that moving is ever, ever easier.

Nikolay Beliov
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q
Got it. And just one clarification question, if I may. James, you mentioned, I believe, that you saw some COVID 
impact in the month of April. Can you please give us some color where in the business you saw that exactly? 
Thank you so much. That's it for me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Nikolay, nothing really to add to our previous answers. The April impact really in the SMB space with more 
of an orientation of SMBs to our cloud products, and then, obviously, the most heavily impacted industries in 
terms of the macro impact from COVID seeing something to there, but absent that, nothing noticeable to report 
across the industries or across geographies.

Keith Eric Weiss
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to follow-up on – I think this 
is a question that Mike Turits was trying to ask. I'll maybe be a little bit more direct about it. One of the things 
investors are trying to understand is like which solutions do customers find most strategic and most missioncritical and that where you're most likely to sustain demand even through difficult times, and which ones are, 
perhaps, less or deemed less mission-critical. And I think the question we are trying to asking is like if we look 
across the solution portfolio, is there parts of the portfolio that people find to be more mission-critical or you 
expect the demand to sustain better in? Like on – if we think about Jira Software less mission-critical and Jira 
Service Desk more, or is there any way you can kind of help us out in terms of how the customers are thinking 
about the mission criticality of the suite? Number one.
And number two, for James, on the – I know it's a very small percentage of customers, but the customers that are 
asking for help, is the form of the help that you guys are willing to give, is that just on payment terms and the like 
or are you guys actually kind of modifying any existing contracts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Keith, Scott here. I'll answer the question about sort of where our products are most mission-critical. Now, what 
we've found is that our products, because they are workflow products that are embedded in our customers' 
workflows in almost all the cases of what we do, whether it's Trello or it's Confluence or it's Bitbucket, or it's 
Confluence for doing collaboration or Jira Service Desk that's serving your customers, your internal helpdesk, like 
all those things are baked into our customers' workflows.
And so, we don't really see them as a discretionary expense that gets turned off when you want to save money, 
like it's key to people being productive. I mean, I think we have an added benefit that we're relatively, compared to 
our peers or competitors, we will be able to lower cost and provide that outcome. And so, we – in 2008, we saw 
some benefit to us because people switched to a lower cost provider to provide those things, where maybe they 
had a legacy provider and they wanted to move.
Now, so that's the way I think about it. It's not an area where I would say that we're particularly strong or weak 
there. Obviously, in our customer base, the more embedded we are in our customers, the sticky we are. And so, 
to the extent that more – to be able to customize their products more, [ph] usually take (00:42:39) probably at 
medium or larger-sized customers, has customized their products more and where people use our third-party 
marketplace. So if two companies will go live, I'd say the ones that are customized at more and have used more 
third parties, we know, are stickier in the numbers.
James, do you want to talk to the next part?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Sure. The bulk of where we are working with our customers are really around payment terms. And I do note 
that those are changes to our arrangements sort of temporary in nature, and that's quite clear in our dialogue with 
those customers.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Heather Bellini
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thank you so much. Just had a couple follow-ups, and thank you, I know the shareholder letter was longer 
this quarter but it was very helpful. My two questions relate to a little bit what other people have been asking. Just 
looking at what you said about April, are you assuming that spending levels from those affected companies and 
industries stay the same throughout the quarter, or in your assumptions, are you expecting business to actually 
get better for those affected companies and industries in May and June?
And then, my follow-up is just, again, you also highlighted 90% of your revenue comes from existing customers. 
From the industries that aren't impacted, what assumptions are you making about net expansions, if you will, 
versus prior periods for June? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Okay. Heather, I'll take that one. So in terms of the guidance that we offered, a few thoughts. First of all, I'd say 
that the philosophy that we brought setting the guidance, in terms of setting the range, placing the range, it's quite 
consistent with what we have done historically. We have laid out a broader revenue range. Clearly, with this 
macroeconomic uncertainty, there is a greater potential variability in our results, and it's certainly challenging to 
accurately estimate the current environment's impact across such a large customer base. So, we have looked 
carefully at our experience in April and considered that and our various leading indicators are top of funnel type 
indicators, and assume that that sort of situation plays out across the balance of the quarter. So hopefully, that's 
helpful to that part of the question.
In terms of around the 90% or so of our revenue that comes from our existing customers, I wouldn't add anything, 
other than obviously, we factor in what we've been seeing in the last few weeks, and again, think specifically 
about the relevant forward-looking indicators for that type of element of the overall revenue structure.

mentioned that you have over 150,000 organizations on starter licenses or subscriptions, and clearly, it's a very 
large number. However, there were over 175,000 starter accounts a year ago. And just given your very strong top 
of funnel, I'm wondering why that has declined? In other words, have you converted a lot of these to paid 
accounts or are there a bunch of them that have just gone away for one reason or another? Hello?

Hi, Gregg. I think – Jay, why don't you take that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. Hey, Gregg. So, I think the macro trend is just to shift to cloud. Remember like – starter license largely talks 
about the server 10-user license for $10. And increasingly, the more attractive value proposition even at the prefree price was to move to cloud, and that was like the macro trend. People are going to install a piece of software. 
If you can get it and get it for effectively the equivalent priced one on the cloud. So, that's been some pressure. 
And then, free is a far more attractive place to start on any Atlassian product. And so, that's sort of the – I think 
the macro effect here on the server starter license.

Gregg, we were pleased with both. I think James mentioned this, but largely, the enterprise segment, both just in 
terms of how we performed in the quarter and then the overall pipeline and traction that we saw through the 
quarter and headed into this one, was positive both across data center, both directly, and then, in with our indirect 
global channel and from standard to premium as an upgrade pattern in cloud.

Cloud Enterprise, could you maybe talk about the investment in enterprise advocates? I know you guys have a 
viral go-to-market motion but the enterprise advocates have been helping in terms of pushing Atlassian as a 
solution set. So, what about the investment in that team going forward?
And then the second one, on the M&A front, I know you guys mentioned that you would be more offensive there. 
Sort of any anything in your portfolio that's lacking right now or how would you think about this strategy going

Copyright © 2001-2020 FactSet CallStreet, LLC
Yeah. I'll take the first one. So, we'll continue invest in enterprise advocates, as we have, to support the data 
center upgrade motion and server both the migration motion from server to enterprise cloud, and the upgrade 
motion from standard cloud to enterprise cloud is really similar. And so, I think we'll continue to expand that team 
to serve the opportunity that enterprise cloud presents us both for existing server customers and are moving and 
for big enterprise customers that are growing.
Remember that we get a lot of leverage in the enterprise advocate group, but from our indirect channel that we –
that is pretty large and deeply connected to our products and our customers in market and we work hand-in-hand 
with them on that bigger enterprise upgrade motion and selling motion, so we get leverage there, which is why the 
enterprise advocate group can grow modestly over time. And we get a lot of leverages from the flywheel. We're 
landing inside of these biggest customers with the high velocity starting point that I think we're really well-known 
for. And then, we can use that as a more efficient leverage point to grow customers, both as we have in data 
center and in certainly up the stack in cloud to enterprise cloud.
And I'll hand it over to Mike on the M&A question, or Scott on the M&A question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Farquhar
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I'll go, obviously. So, the – if I think of M&A, again, we've – I've been really proud of how we've done that. 
You can build products, you can partner, you can have a marketplace, you can acquire, and I think Atlassian is a 
company that have done all those very successfully over our almost 20 years there. And when we look at 
acquisitions, the things we always look for is, firstly, are they aligned with our mission to unleash the potential of 
every team, do they help us get to our [indiscernible] (00:51:31) goal of 100 million active users, do they fit with 
the values of our company, do they fit with our business model, and then, [indiscernible] (00:51:41) other things 
we really look for, and I think we've been very successful with that approach, in a measured approach of making 
sure that we bring on the companies that are really great fit for Atlassian, as Mike and I have been the biggest 
shareholders of Atlassian and we're aligned with all of you on this call and all of the shareholders listening in 
terms of being good stewards of capital and making sure that we invest wisely to get the returns that all of us 
would want.

Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask two questions. The first one is on mix and the second is on COVID. The 
mix question is probably for James, to build on something that was asked before. But perpetual was down yearover-year and you indicated you had some pull-ins. It's actually hasn't been down previously, despite some 
pricing changes. And so, as we look out – you said growth was moderate. Would it still be, you think, a positive 
number as we look out over the next couple quarters?
And the related part of that is on the maintenance side. Maintenance has been steady at 20%, 21% growth for 
some time. If perpetual wanes, should we start to think about the maintenance side also perhaps slowing? I would

think that would be a long process, but I just wanted to hear a little bit about that. And then, I'll ask my COVID 
question as a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Sure. So in the perpetual license line, yes, we have been seeing those pull-forward effects into Q2 from Q3. And I 
would expect other of our coming quarters, the next couple of quarters, for example, to see similar types of pullforward effects when we record those results. So, that will drive the dynamic of whether it's a lower percentage 
growth or whether it is, in fact, a shrinking of the absolute dollar figure. Again, the dollar figure is a relatively small 
one at this point in time because so much of the new activity is taken by our customers going straight to one or 
more of our cloud services.
Now also, in terms of the maintenance line, clearly, we have spoken a great deal about our efforts to migrate 
customers from server over to cloud, and indeed, some of our server customers migrate up to data center as well. 
So if that continues to happen and continues to build over time, then yes, there'll be fewer customers executing 
their renewal of their server contracts. Instead, they'll be taking on data center or cloud contracts. And so, yes, 
you would see that effect to maintenance line over time. But I think you're right in characterizing that as a more 
gradual effect than that, that you see in the license line because the license line reflect brand new activity, ease 
up a new company coming in to buy our server products, or it could reflect a current customer buying additional 
licenses, more uses for their current licenses, that sort of thing. And so, I would expect you to see the drawdown 
most pronounced on the license line but also a similar effect over time on the maintenance line.

Keith Bachman
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q
Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then, Jay, maybe in the spirit of this is your last call, I'll direct this one to 
you. When you think about or talk about COVID and the interactions with the customers, A, is there any sense 
about you could give us the dollar exposure to SMB? In other words, is that X percent of your revenues? And B, 
when you say that you're having some impact, what's the behavior there? Is it less upsell, is it not renewing the 
monthly? Is there any feedback you can give on what that means in terms of behavior when you say you're being 
impacted. And all the best in your future endeavors.

Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Thanks, Keith. I'll start and James may want to tag along. I think we've addressed this a bunch over the course of 
the call. Like we've seen largely – the impact that we've seen [indiscernible] (00:56:23) from the small to medium 
business segment in cloud, and we saw that in March and continued a little bit in April. And mostly, that is around 
customers either not expanding at the rate that we wanted them to, or in some cases, reducing their license 
counts because they reduced the size of their employee population.
We're happy – on the cost side, by the way, we're also happy with the rate of new customer acquisition and has 
been where we want it to be. And so, I think that's a good positive signal. And then, as I mentioned, the enterprise 
segment, which is a growing proportion of our business, remains healthy, both just in terms of what we did in the 
quarter and pipeline that we're building.
And James, you may want to tackle on some color as well.

Ari Terjanian
Analyst, Cleveland Research Co. LLC Q
Thank you so much for having me on the call. Congrats on the results. Two questions. First, if you could give a 
little bit more impact, you touched upon it on the shareholder letter, but – and talk about collaboration, but any 
more examples of how customers may be using your tools and solutions to help address COVID. And we think 
you guys will make more templates, more kind of pre-packaged applications to help. And then, second, you talked 
about [ph] phase-up (00:57:57) of the leaderboard. Are there any areas where you see a potential for greater 
share gains over the next 6 to 12 months across your portfolio? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I'll take the first one. Scott mentioned a bunch of these use cases. [ph] I mean (00:58:16), we become a 
way to coordinate project activity content, in the case of COVID, where everybody has gone remote. I think our 
products become pretty critical as a way to connect to people to what they're trying to do. And so, I think there's a 
bunch of great use cases highlighted in the document, even when you think about something as maybe that 
seems a little mundane, is how do we get people back into our offices. I mean, that is a fairly – can be a fairly 
complicated amount of work with a whole bunch of considerations, as we emerge from this, and maybe if people 
go back into an office into work, and they've got to do things like get on an elevator, you have to consider like how 
desks get spaced out differently. That involves a ton of human coordination and action, and that's typically where 
our products get brought in to help customers and help teams.
And maybe – who will take the second part? Maybe Mike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I can certainly take the second part of that. Look, the question was where do we expect share gains, et 
cetera. Look, all of the markets we operate in, whether you look at Agile and DevOps in the software teams 
market, whether you look at IT and the broader sort of ITSM, enterprise service management spaces, or whether 
you just look at collaborative work management tools, whether teams are remote or not remote, people are going 
to change their work styles as a result of this. So, I would say all sort of three of our major markets, we have very 
small shares, and all three of the markets are growing by themselves. So, we expect that to be a lot of 
opportunities to look there.

Scott mentioned talent. It's quite likely that this is a period over the next couple of years where there is a higher 
availability of talent in different markets that we operate in geographically. That's very important for us. And I think 
what's important is to see us just constantly optimizing our business. Again, as Scott mentioned a little bit in 2008, 
2009, when we introduced the startup program, which is a little bit of an analogy to what we've done in free and 
cloud. That really sets the platform to drive a decade of growth across a lot of different markets that brought in 
tens of thousands of businesses to the Atlassian experience that over time grew up into different parts of our 
world. And those are the companies we see the moment moving from server to data center or evaluating Cloud 
Premium or Cloud Enterprise.
So when we talk about playing a long-term gamut, that's exactly what we mean. We believe this can have an 
opportunity in three very large markets that we serve, and you'll see us continue to make moves to try to be 
opportunistic where we see that. We've seen that in free already, have seen that in hiring. We'll continue to 
evaluate our acquisition opportunities as we look through that, but we're very positive about what that means for 
us going forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Enders
Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Q
Hi. This is Steve Enders on for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to get a better sense of how your 
partners and sales teams are adjusting to work-from-home initiatives and their ability to drive expansion within 
your largest customers.
And secondly, want to get a better understanding of – I think you mentioned that you're looking to hire more 
people and focus more on the R&D side. But where are the biggest opportunities for investment in the product 
and R&D teams now? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Hey, Steve. I'll take the first part. I mean, our sales teams – our direct sales teams are all largely inside teams. 
And so, they're working largely either from home. They did work from home in the past, where they work in 
offices, engaging with the customers. So, I think that hasn't really changed. Partners are in market with 
customers. And so, I think there's an impact there for partners that can't meet with customers. But we've been 
working over the past 10 years to help digitize like our solution partners. And so, the way that we market – comarket with them, the way that we help generate demand in market, combines both offline, which may have a 
little bit of a pause until we can get back to a different – the old normal, but we complemented that with a whole 
bunch of online digital demand capability that we [indiscernible] (01:02:58). So just in terms of building pipeline 
and letting them serve customers, I don't anticipate that we'll have too much of an impact.

Yeah. And if I could just briefly interject on that, Jay, just to support that, I've been pleased with, as I said earlier, 
we've been tracking very closely all aspects of our financials in April, and partner performance has been tracking 
well.
[indiscernible] (01:03:28)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Cannon-Brookes
Co-Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
I'm sorry. I can jump in and take the second part of that on R&D. Look, we still believe we have a massive number 
of opportunities to invest in R&D. I highlighted certain of the big things like Trello [indiscernible] (01:03:46) taking 
advantage of the changing work style. As more companies are working for home, tools like that are obviously 
becoming more valuable. Confluence creates synchronous communications, things like this. So obviously, in the 
product set, there's a lot of opportunities.
Secondly, we're in the midst of a decade-long transition to our [ph] senior (01:04:08) Atlassian platform, the 
teamwork platform. That's not a simple exercise. It's going to continue to take us years to build out, even though 
we turn really good progress so far. You've seen lots of examples of that, but the new [ph] club is better and 
(01:04:22) rolling out in Confluence, which is a huge change. It involves a lot of changes in identity and other key 
parts of our platform as they roll through different products.
And then, thirdly would be in the enterprise segment. We've talked about Cloud Enterprise, the new edition that 
we put into early access program [indiscernible] (01:04:40). That's a massive amount of infrastructural and 
calculated changes in how we operate our products to meet the demands of our largest customers and scale 
them in the cloud. That's not a one [indiscernible] (01:04:56) exercise. That's a continued R&D investment and 
requires large scale changes in our infrastructure and how we deploy products, how we work with data residency, 
how we work with security, how we work with our companies, our networks, et cetera, and still provide the flexible 
cloud products that we do and scale them to those needs. So, we'll first continue to invest largely all across the 
board, but those are three useful examples of variability we are investing.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC Q
Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question, James, with respect to guidance, if I look at the midpoint, it 
does imply sequentially down revenue for Q4. But I guess I'm just trying to understand the kind of bigger levers in 
driving that. Is it increase in dollar churn or should we think maybe there's more trade-down to pre-SKUs or 
perhaps an acceleration of on-prem to cloud? If you could give some color there. And then, I've got a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Beer
Chief Financial Officer, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
So, it just points to really three different thoughts. First of all, recall my earlier comments about pull-forward 
[indiscernible] (01:06:18). So, I would expect what we benefited from in Q2 in terms of a pull-forward effect, that's

drawing from both Q3, Q4, and probably the next two quarters of fiscal 2021. So, I think that's important to bear in 
mind.
Yes. As Mike talked about earlier, we have fully rolled out free as the [ph] deco (01:06:46) option for our entrylevel customers. So, I would say that the effect there is quite modest. We guided this asset this year to the impact 
that we thought would occur from free during the year, and it was one of three components of a 1-point headwind 
to revenue growth, and I feel as though we're tracking well too fast. And then, obviously, we've been talking about 
the impacts of COVID generating the macroeconomic sort of circumstances that are impacting some of our SMB 
cloud customers in particular.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
J. Derrick Wood
Analyst, Cowen and Company, LLC Q
Okay. I guess a broader question. I mean, I would imagine there's a lot of people that are looking for cost 
optimization right now. Maybe that gives you a window to attract more IT people to your platform. You've got low 
costs, particularly around Jira Service Desk. So, can you talk about maybe some new initiatives you guys are 
thinking about doing to target the IT buyer more aggressively in this environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Simons
President, Atlassian Corp. Plc A
Yeah. I mean, Derrick, we – it's an ongoing focus for us. IT is, as we've talked about, is an increasing place that 
we can win with JSD. And to your point, like we agree, we are, I think, a value choice and a high product quality 
choice, and that combination of things sets us up well in this environment. But we'll continue to talk about the IT 
service management and IT kind of broad collaboration, service collaboration areas that we focus on, both across 
JSD and with OpsGenie and with Confluence and Trello, I mean, there's – we've got, I think, a really rich portfolio 
that we can talk to IT about, both to help serve the problems that they're trying to solve internally for themselves, 
but more importantly, for the problems that they're in charge of for their companies.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc.
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to report strong results in the fourth quarter, with non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 per share, above 
the high end of our guidance range on solid performance in our licensing business. We were also pleased to see 
our licensing revenue return to a seasonal pattern, with fiscal Q1 as a high based on our recent licensing 
agreement with Apple.
Over the last several years, we have invested to establish QUALCOMM as a leader in 5G. As a reminder, 5G 
brings a significant increase in complexity over 4G such as new and dense network architectures, highperformance basebands, advanced RF front-end designs, increased processing requirements, in addition to 
driving the leading-edge process node.

We are actively focused on helping to define and standardize Releases 16 and 17 features to support the 
expansion of 5G into new large adjacent markets, such as enterprise, industrial IoT, and automotive. The 
complexity and expansion of cellular technologies beyond the smartphone into nearly every industry play directly 
to QUALCOMM's strengths and are why we believe 5G will represent the single biggest opportunity in 
QUALCOMM's history.
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2020, the company remains focused on these three key priorities, number one, 
continue executing on 5G with our partners around the world. The number of OEMs and operators launching 5G 
products and services continues to increase throughout the year. There are now over 40 OEMs and over 30 
operators launching or announcing 5G products or commercial service, up from approximately 20 OEMs and 
operators respectively at the start of the year. Looking forward, we expect 5G to launch in all regions within the 
next two to three years.
On the product side, in September we announced plans to accelerate 5G global commercialization at scale by 
expanding our portfolio of 5G mobile platforms into the Snapdragon 7 Series and 6 Series, launching as early as 
calendar Q1 2020. Our integrated 5G SOCs will support both sub-6 gigahertz and millimeter wave at the volume 
tiers across all geographies.
As we continue to expand our 5G product portfolio, our design wins are also increasing. We now have over 230 
5G design wins launched or in development, up from 150 in the prior quarter, virtually all of which are using our 
RF front-end solutions for 5G sub-6 and/or millimeter wave. Notably, multiple OEMs are now shipping or have 
announced their second or third 5G device models using both our Snapdragon 5G core chipset and our modemto-antenna RF front-end solution.
In Korea, the migration to 5G continues at a strong pace. According to the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT, 
Korean operators have already signed up 3.5 million 5G subscribers through September, a pace that remains 
faster than its migration to 4G. Additionally, 5G millimeter wave services are in planning stages by Korean carriers 
for calendar 2020.
In the United States, Verizon has committed to deploy 5G Ultra Wideband millimeter wave in 30 markets by year 
end, and T-Mobile separately announced plans to cover 200 million people with 5G on 600 megahertz before the 
end of this year. And in Europe, there are multiple 5G launches across Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom, 
and Germany.
In China, all three mobile operators commercially launched 5G services last week, bringing 5G to the largest 
smartphone subscriber base in the world. We now estimate that by the end of this year, the three operators will 
deploy a total of approximately 130,000 5G base stations. We further estimate that by the end of 2020, 5G base 
station deployments will increase to approximately 1 million, which to put in context is 10 times the scale of the 
entire network of a large U.S. operator.
Lastly, TSMC recently attributed the significant increase in demand for their leading technology nodes to a 
stronger outlook for 5G deployment next year. This is yet another significant indicator of the 5G ramp into 2020.
Second priority, to expand our technology platform into adjacent industry segments. In automotive, we are very 
encouraged with the engagement and design win traction we are experiencing from automakers and Tier 1 
customers with our telematics and third-generation Snapdragon automotive cockpit solutions. Our design win 
pipeline has now increased to almost $6.5 billion, up from $5 billion at the start of the fiscal year, giving us great

visibility into strong growth in auto over the next several years. Over time, as the technology roadmap in auto 
converges with the cellular roadmap, we expect to see an increased opportunity to lead in new product 
categories, notably ADAS.
In compute, we continue to build traction in the Windows on Snapdragon always on, always connected PC 
category. In August, Samsung announced the Galaxy Book S based on the Snapdragon 8cx. This is Samsung's 
second Windows on Snapdragon device and the first announced Snapdragon 8cx always connected PC.
In October, Microsoft launched the Surface Pro X, our first design with Microsoft in this premium tier, powered by 
a Snapdragon 8cx variant that is designed for the always-on compute environment, the Microsoft SQ1, developed 
in partnership with Microsoft. This is the thinnest Surface ever and has 3 times the performance per watt as a 
Surface Pro 6.
Priority three, drive revenue growth, operating leverage, and earnings per share. Consistent with our comments 
last quarter, we continue to expect a positive inflection point as 5G ramps beginning in our fiscal second quarter. 
With the conclusion of our cost plan and significant share repurchases over the last year, we are poised to deliver 
margin expansion and outsized growth in earnings and earnings per share as revenue growth accelerates.
We are pleased with the progress we have made over the course of 2019 and believe the business is very well 
positioned for sustained long-term growth as we benefit from the decisions and investments made over the last 
several years, including 5G, the return of Apple licensing and product revenues, growth in RF front-end, and 
growth in adjacent businesses.
Before I turn the call over to Akash, I'd like to congratulate him on becoming QUALCOMM's Chief Financial 
Officer. As QCT finance lead for the past four years, Akash brings a deep knowledge base of our company, both 
operationally and strategically. I'm looking forward to working closely with Akash as we enter this next chapter of 
our history.
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.

Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc.
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.
It is a very exciting time to become Chief Financial Officer of QUALCOMM, and I'm looking forward to engaging 
with our shareholders and analysts. I will begin with a discussion of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings.
We delivered strong results with non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range, and 
revenues of $4.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance in the quarter was 
primarily driven by QTL on higher units and stronger mix, resulting in QTL revenues of $1.16 billion and EBT 
margin of 68%. As a reminder, we did not record any royalty revenues from Huawei in our fiscal fourth quarter 
results.
QCT delivered revenues of $3.6 billion and 152 million MSM chip shipments, in line with our expectations for the 
quarter. QCT's EBT margin was approximately 14%, flat sequentially and at the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to fiscal 2019, we recorded $19.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues and $3.54 in non-GAAP earnings per 
share. During the year, we achieved several key milestones that position us favorably for fiscal 2020 and beyond.

First, our early investments in 5G played a key role in accelerating 5G deployments, and we have secured over 
230 chipset design wins. Second, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in RF360 Holdings and 
established a strong design win pipeline for RF front-end products across 5G sub-6 and millimeter wave devices. 
Third, we signed global patent license and multiyear chipset supply agreements with Apple. Fourth, we concluded 
our cost reduction plan, announced in January 2018. And lastly, since our July 2018 announcement, we have 
completed approximately $23 billion in stock repurchase through fiscal 2019 at an average price of $65 per share, 
resulting in a 22% reduction of our shares outstanding.
Turning to our outlook, we are maintaining our estimate of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion units for calendar 2019 for 
global 3G, 4G, 5G device forecast. For calendar 2020, we are estimating 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion units, up 
approximately 3% at the midpoint, reflecting flat handsets and low double-digit growth in non-handsets. We are 
estimating 175 million to 225 million 5G handset units in calendar 2020.
Consistent with our comments on our previous earnings call, our business outlook is impacted by several factors, 
including weaker demand in China and certain developed regions, Huawei share gain in China, and OEMs 
managing 4G inventory ahead of the transition to 5G.
Turning to our first quarter guidance for fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $5.2 
billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.90. We estimate fiscal first quarter QTL revenues to be in 
the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 70% to 74%. We expect QTL revenues to be up 21% 
sequentially at the midpoint in our fiscal first quarter due to normal holiday seasonality, driven by timing of flagship 
phone launches. Our fiscal first quarter forecast does not include any royalty revenues from Huawei while we 
continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of the licensing dispute.
With the completion of the global patent license agreement with Apple earlier this year, QTL revenues will begin 
to reflect a seasonally high fiscal first quarter. Following this seasonal uplift, we expect QTL revenues to return to 
a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in our fiscal second quarter.
In QCT, we estimate fiscal first quarter MSM shipments of 145 million to 165 million units and EBT margin in the 
range of 10% to 12%. QCT's EBT margin guidance reflects lower volume in the premium and high tiers, driven by 
a pause ahead of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020 and the normal timing of handset launches by our 
customers in these tiers.
As we look beyond our fiscal first quarter, we see a significant inflection point for QCT as we expect to realize the 
benefits from the ramp of 5G handset launches. In the fiscal second quarter, we anticipate QCT revenues to grow 
in the mid-teens sequentially and QCT EBT margin to return to the mid-teens.
In our fiscal first quarter, we expect non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be flat to down 2% 
sequentially. As a reminder, expenses are typically higher in our fiscal second quarter, as it includes the normal 
calendar resets for certain employee-related costs.
Interest expense net of investment and other income in the fiscal first quarter is expected to be approximately 
$100 million, and is a reasonable estimate for each of the remaining quarters in fiscal 2020.
For our fiscal first quarter, we also estimate approximately 1.16 billion weighted average shares outstanding and a 
tax rate of 14%.

Looking forward, 2020 is an exciting year for QUALCOMM, as we expect the financial upside of our 5G strategy 
to begin to play out with multiple drivers of non-GAAP revenue and earnings growth, including the launch of 5G 
devices, RF front-end design win traction, growth in adjacencies combined with operating leverage, and a 
substantially reduced share count. We look forward to seeing you in New York at our Analyst Day on November 
19, where we will be providing additional details about our long-term growth strategy.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio.

Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are ready for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. 
Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Caso
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Yes, thank you, good evening. I guess first question would be on the pace of the 5G ramp as you proceed 
through the fiscal year. You've given some indications on where you expect overall revenue to be. If you could, 
talk about that in percentage terms of 5G as a percentage of the mix as it goes through the year, even on revenue 
terms or MSM terms, whatever you could do to give us some sense of how 5G penetrates as the year goes on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi. Thanks, Chris. This is Cristiano. Consistent I think with what we just said in the earnings call, I think timing, our 
fiscal Q2 is that we started to see the inflection point as the devices have started to show up in volumes. And 
overall, I think mix. We expect that to be ramping in the high – in the premium tier in some of the markets that 
we're seeing launching 5G. Within that, we provided a metric before that we will see probably 1.5 times the ASP 
as we look at higher content for both the modem as well as the RF front-end.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Caso
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q
Okay, thank you. And as a follow-on to that, maybe you could give us some commentary on how that impacts 
QCT margins as the year progresses. Obviously, you've got that additional content. The margins are depressed 
as you're making that transition now. What should we expect as the year goes on, on those QCT margins?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Chris. This is Akash. The way you should think about the year playing out for QCT with 5G is really there are 
going to be two inflection points in the chip business. The first inflection point will be flagship launches in early 
2020 by both our global and Chinese OEMs, and you should think of it as RMB 3,000 and above handsets will 
start adopting 5G. The second inflection point will be in the fall timeframe when another set of flagship devices will 
adopt 5G. So that should be the shape of 5G adoption through the year.

And how this translates into margin is we gave guidance for our second quarter margin. We are expecting from 
first to second quarter revenue will go up mid-teens, and operating margins will also be in the mid-teens range in 
the second quarter. We are not guiding longer-term margins at this point, but we'll talk about it at Analyst Day as 
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed 
with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James E. Faucette
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a follow-up to that. And maybe, Cristiano, you can talk about where you 
see QUALCOMM where it's particularly strong positioned in terms of like if we look at flagships down through the 
different tiers of phones, where you've talked a lot about design wins. But where should we expect you to show up 
most strongly versus where maybe there may be a bit more variety of suppliers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Thanks for the question, James. We updated our design pipeline. The design pipeline is about now 230-plus 5G 
devices across now multiple tiers. It's up substantially since six months ago.
And I'll answer your question two ways. First, I think it's been very clear that our early investment in millimeter 
wave has provided QUALCOMM with a significant technology advantage in having the technology to maturity, 
and we're optimistic about millimeter wave going from the United States initial launches into Korea, in Japan, in 
other markets, including being licensed already in Europe. Telecom Italia was the first one, happening throughout 
2020. That's a very good thing for QUALCOMM.
Having said that, I would probably say that every single launch of a flagship OEM today with the exception of 
Huawei, they use their own silicon, every other launch of every other OEM has been a QUALCOMM Snapdragon 
platform, and that positioned us very well to partner with OEMs for 5G ramp, including Samsung, which we have 
not only launched with the traditional markets, but also I point you to the A Series, which is the second tier below 
the flagship, that have been launching with QUALCOMM globally in addition to the Galaxy Fold. So those are 
positive things as we think 5G transition for QUALCOMM.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James E. Faucette
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q
Great. And then a follow-up question maybe for Steve and Don, you mentioned that you're in ongoing 
negotiations with Huawei but haven't reached any agreement as of yet. How do you think – or what needs to 
happen to move an agreement across the line? And are we going to – I guess I'm wondering how China-US trade 
relations and potential resolution or at least a trade agreement may factor in to those negotiations and 
conversations with Huawei.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Chief Executive Officer & Director, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
James, it's Steve. So we continue to talk to Huawei. I would characterize the discussions as ongoing, but really 
nothing to report on. Obviously, we don't have the numbers – we don't have any revenue in the numbers right 
now for licensing revenue.

In terms of how the trade discussions between the two countries impact the probability or chance that we can get 
a resolution, I think it's too early to tell. I think it's pretty opaque at the moment. It's good that we're talking but 
there's really nothing to report on right now. And you know that the product business for us is actually quite small. 
We tend to be a little bit more insulated I think from the trade talks compared to maybe other companies, but too 
early to tell in terms of what it will mean to the licensing discussions.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with 
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samik Chatterjee
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off firstly by focusing a bit on the RF front-end opportunity. 
You mentioned that most of the design wins you're seeing, both the modem and the RF front-end go together.
So I just wanted to get your thoughts about how you're thinking about market share in RF front-end and the early 
generation 5G phones [ph] were to do (00:23:44) some of the incumbents in the space? And then how should we 
think about sustaining that market share in the second-generation, third-generation 5G phones? And then I have 
a follow-up. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Thanks for the question. So we look at 5G as the key entry point for the RF front-end business. And we're very 
satisfied with the ability as we started to look into the designs with the 5G content, which are specifically sub-6 
spectrum as well as millimeter wave spectrum, we actually have seen a very high percentage. Virtually all of the 
230-plus designs now for 5G content have QUALCOMM modem-to-antenna design. We have seen in those 
devices some of our existing incumbents continue to support and provide content for 4G, but the 5G position of 
QUALCOMM is very strong.
What we're very happy, especially at this time as we head into the Q2 ramp of 5G, we see now as we go into 
second-generation designs. For the second-generation devices as well and lower tiers, we have maintained that 
pattern. So we're now going into design number two and design number three that maintain the 5G content on the 
RF front-end, and we're very happy with that development.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samik Chatterjee
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Perfect. If I can just follow up, you've talked extensively about the opportunity on 5G handsets. If you can, help me 
quantify the revenue opportunity outside of handsets, be it like small cells or IoT that is also tied to a 5G 
opportunity, but outside of handsets. I'm just looking for some color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So let me give you the first part of the answer, and then I'll ask Akash to add. Devices and smartphones are 
definitely going to be the vast majority of the earnings, especially as we head in 2020. That's how 5G is going to 
ramp. However, we are happy about the 5G traction in all of our adjacents, from upgrade of telematics in 
automotive to 5G. We've seen a lot of industrial IoT applications. And even our small cell business is getting 
traction, including with traditional infrastructure vendors. So we expect that to be a growth story as we head into

2021 and 2022. In 2020, the one that I want to single out is CPE for mobile broadband, and that's part of a lot of 
the carriers' deployment of 5G and fixed wireless.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with 
your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ross Seymore
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong results and 5G color. I just wanted to see about the seasonality on the QCT side 
– or QTL side, excuse me. Steve, you mentioned that you were happy it was returning to a seasonal pattern. You 
talked a little bit I think, Akash, about what it was going to do in the fiscal second quarter. Can you just talk about 
the seasonality of that? Is the range that you've given in the past of the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, is that the new 
range in the weak quarters, and the stronger quarters would be closer to the $1.4 million you just did, or how 
should we think about that as the year progresses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Ross. This is Akash. I think that's a fair way of thinking about it. We just reported actuals for the September 
quarter at $1.16 billion, and we're guiding the December quarter at the midpoint of $1.4 billion and the March 
quarter at $1.1 billion. So that gives you a sense of the seasonality in the business, and those are fair numbers to 
use to project the business going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ross Seymore
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q
Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, perhaps one for Cristiano on the revenue per MSM side of things. I just 
would hope to get a little more color on why is that going down sequentially in your fiscal first quarter guide. And 
perhaps more importantly, it seems like it's up very nicely, almost 12% year over year in fiscal 2019. And still, 
despite that sequential decline in your fiscal first quarter, still up the better part of 10% there. I was wondering 
what's driving the sequential decline, the year-over-year increases? And then if that's all pre-5G, how should we 
think about the lift off of this level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Ross, so our ASP per MSM has a very high sensitivity to high and premium tiers. And if you look at what 
happened in the quarter and the guide for the next one, I think consistent with what we said in the last earnings 
call that we're going to see the dynamic throughout the calendar year. We have some weaker market, weaker 
demand in China, and that combined with Huawei gaining share in domestic China as well. That's one dynamic.
The other dynamic is OEMs canceled some of the 4G flagships and moved their portfolio towards 5G getting 
ahead of the launch. So that creates basically a change in the composition of the MSM because of the high and 
premium tier units as we go to that transition. However, the inflection point for Q2 is where you started to see the 
effect of when we talked about the 1.5 times. If anything, the guide that we provide on Q2, it contemplates the 
current market environment, the typical seasonality of our business, no significant changes in OEM share, and 
does not include yet the ramp of the Apple business, you'll see that change just with the 1.5 times, which in 
average has higher ASP content on the modem plus the RF front-end.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Thank you very much, good afternoon. Congratulations, Akash. I guess, Steve, my first question is around the 5G 
unit numbers that you gave for calendar 2020. I guess the midpoint that you guys have laid out is 200 million 
units. Maybe you could give a little color on what you're assuming the geographic mix of those units is, in 
particular, what percentage might be China versus rest of world. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.

Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Matt. This is Akash. So the way we thought about the 5G forecast for 2020 is a couple ways. We looked at the 
tops-down of how transitions have typically happened in previous generations. And the two things that are 
different with 5G versus transition from 3G to 4G is China is adopting 5G at the same time as the other 
geographies, versus in 4G they were a couple years late. And then also within 5G, we're seeing multiple tiers of 
products being launched simultaneously, which we did not have for 4G. So that's why we think the intensity of the 
5G rollout is actually faster. And you have China as a big portion of it happening early in the life cycle.
Of course, in addition to that, we're obviously talking to all of our OEM customers, and we have a very good sense 
of how many devices they are planning to launch over the next several months with 5G and at what price points, 
and that also allows us to inform our tops-down forecast.

Matthew D. Ramsay
Analyst, Cowen & Co. LLC Q
Got it, that's really helpful. As my follow-up, a quick one for Alex on the licensing agreements. And obviously, 
we're all encouraged to see the progress you've made on 5G. There's also been this dynamic of SEP-only 
licenses becoming a bigger piece of the mix and some implications for the implied royalty rate. I know that moves 
around a bit. But I think you guys talked about in an answer to an earlier question about how to model the QTL 
business going forward. I wonder if we're now at relative steady state for implied royalty rates as we go forward. 
Any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander H. Rogers
Executive Vice Presdent & President, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So I think that may be a fair way to look at it. But I think the way you should look at it for guidance is we're guiding
revenue. And so as we noted, we're going to see seasonality and we're going to see the remaining quarters at the 
range that we identified. And of course, that's without the Huawei numbers. But we have made really good 
progress with signing up 5G agreements. We have over 75 agreements now in place since we started our 5G 
licensing program. So I think that reflects a very strong IP position. But I think again, if you look to our guidance 
on revenue, that's probably the easiest way to think about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
And, Matt, this is Akash. Just a quick reminder that our revenue guidance numbers does not include Huawei. So 
as that gets resolved, that would be incremental to the range.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please 
proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Analyst, Bernstein Research Q
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Around the March quarter QCT guide, so units in March quarter for 
MSM units are typically down seasonally. You're obviously guiding revenues up mid-teens on the 5G ramp. So is 
that all or even maybe more than 100% due to increases in revenue per MSM? Is it that the 5G ramp itself in
content is enough to offset the normal seasonal decline in unit shipments, or are you seeing an ending of the flush 
that we've been having and maybe a reversal with some fill-in as some of the new products get in? How do we 
think about that unit versus ASP trend embedded in that March quarter revenue guide for chipsets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Stacy. So there are a couple factors. This is Akash, by the way. There are a couple factors that affect our 
second quarter numbers for units and ASP. You're correct about the seasonally lower quarter, but that is also 
offset by a stronger mix because we launched our new premium tier chip and new high-tier chip during that 
quarter as well. So there is a mix implication before we get to the 5G benefit. And then the third factor is what we 
have disclosed previously, which is with 5G devices. On a like-for-like device basis, we expect 1.5x monetization 
as a combination of the chipset and the RF front-end revenue on top of it. So those are the three factors that 
impact the volume and price – revenue per MSM mix in the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy Aaron Rasgon
Analyst, Bernstein Research Q
Thanks. And maybe just to follow-up on that, so you mentioned 1.5 times content increase. But at the same time, 
you also mentioned multiple tiers launching simultaneously, which is something that we didn't really see in 4G. So 
how do we think about that – I guess that differential of those drivers on content increase overall versus the 
general mix of tiers that are launching? And do you think that is enough to keep revenue per MSM rising through 
2020, through fiscal 2020 as 5G becomes more mainstream?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So the way we think about the 1.5x is really for a given tier device, so comparing a premium tier to a premium tier 
device, when you go from 4G to 5G, the revenue opportunity increases by 1.5x. And then this would also apply to 
the tiers as it penetrates further down. And so you should think of that as a mechanism of modeling our business 
as the mix improves from 4G to 5G.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually just want to focus a little bit back just on the pricing you guys

think about that ramping over the next 12 months? I think most models have it going up a few dollars but is that 
right to do, or do you think it needs to be changed after seeing the mix come through?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander H. Rogers
Executive Vice Presdent & President, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Okay. Look, again, the way we think about it is that – Akash maybe will weigh in here. The way we think about it 
is that Huawei is incremental. And I'm not sure what more to say to that other than what we've already provided 
by way of guide.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mitch Steves
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Okay. I guess maybe we return to the Huawei piece then. If that comes back, are you going to be increasing 
ASPs, or do you think that the ASP is going to be flattish or similar?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
This is Akash, Mitch. The way you should think about Huawei is we don't have Huawei units or revenue 
contemplated in the QTL guide at this point. So when Huawei gets included into the guide, it would be based on 
what their device ASP is and our licensing deal with them. So it will just fall out of the agreement that we end up 
having with Huawei.

Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just go back to the progress of 5G and particularly millimeter wave, 
Akash. And I wonder, Cristiano, if you could talk a little bit about of the 230 wins, or maybe, Steve, you want to 
address this. How many of those have millimeter wave attached to them or at least some version of them?
And then as we get to the flagship launches at the beginning of next year, proportionally, how does it look? And 
then as we get to the end of next year, how does that look? Do we get to most phones by the end of next year 
having millimeter wave attached or some smaller proportion? Could you just walk us through that? And then I 
have a follow-up.

Hi, Rod, thanks for the question. So the way to think about it, it's pretty much at this point by market. For example, 
the United States market, all of the devices they have launched, there is a requirement for millimeter wave that 
the spectrum utilize by all of the – three of the four carriers right now. And therefore, we have seen the initial 
launches of millimeter wave.
Going into 2020, the current planning assumption is you're going to start to see millimeter wave also coming in the 
Korea market. It's going to come into the Japan market. And the later part of 2020 and beginning 2021, you start 
to see that in Europe, and that's how it's going to change the mix.
Right now, you should look at some of the China launches that we're going to see in 2020, they are going to be 
sub-6, and Europe in 2020 the first half will be sub-6. Japan, Korea, and the United States are going to have 
millimeter wave. That's how to think about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rod Hall
Analyst, Goldman Sachs Q
And is it your – Cristiano, just to follow that up, is it your assumption or our assumption should be that every 
market that has millimeter wave deployed in the wireless network, you would expect to see millimeter wave 
attached to most phones in that market. Is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
That's correct. And especially because you have – in the wireless industry today, you have probably a single SKU 
launch by an operator within their entire geography, even if you're going to have some markets with millimeter 
wave, some markets with sub-6. That has been the requirement of millimeter wave capability in many of those 5G 
devices.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
C. J. Muse
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q
Good afternoon, thank you for taking the question. I guess to follow up on the last question, as you think about the 
200 million 5G unit market plus or minus in 2020, what percentage do you believe will have millimeter wave? And 
then as part of that question, can you talk through the attach rate that you're seeing on RF front-end for you guys 
at sub-6 versus millimeter wave? I would assume a much higher rate there on millimeter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi. Let me answer in reverse order. So on the Snapdragon platform today, the attach rate on millimeter wave and 
sub-6 is the same. I think we have modem-to-antenna designs, including RF front-end, in all of the Snapdragons. 
There are very few exceptions. And sometimes, the exception is just one or another band, and it's very small 
quantities. I'll say the absolute majority of the devices we've been winning RF front-end across millimeter wave 
and sub-6. It's not unique to millimeter wave. However, millimeter wave drives a little more content because, 
unlike sub-6, you need multiple antenna modules and multiple RF chains of millimeter wave. So the content is 
disproportionately higher on the millimeter wave side.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
C. J., on the mix of sub-6 versus millimeter-wave within the 200 million, at this point, we're not disclosing a mix 
really. But the way to best think about it is what, as Cristiano mentioned earlier, is by market. And so there are 
certain markets, US and then Japan and Korea next year, where millimeter wave would be required from an 
operator perspective, and so those markets would have millimeter wave. So the best way to think about it is a mix 
of markets.

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Arcuri
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Hi, thanks. I wanted to just clarify the answer that you had to a prior question on the March guidance for QCT. So 
are you basically implying that units are going to maybe be seasonal plus just a smidge, and most of the increase 
in QCT revenue in March is ASP? Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Yes, I think the units will have the regular cadence of seasonality, maybe with some increase that's driven by 5G 
launches. But primarily, it will be a mix of the tier mix within the chips we have, and then also the 4G with this 5G 
mix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy Arcuri
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q
Okay. And then I guess just following on to that then, if you're not getting much of the unit benefit yet in March, 
obviously you're going to eventually have to see that unit benefit. So how sustainable is the growth in QCT 
revenue into fiscal Q3 when you would I would think see much more the unit growth in that quarter? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
So from a market perspective, the way we are planning our business going forward is we're assuming the current 
market dynamics hold. And within that, our benefit is as the transition happens to 5G. And then – so that should 
be the basis for the assumptions for next year.
Now, as we have both initial set of 5G launches happen and then additional 5G launches happen across flagships 
models later in the year, we'll see our operating margin ramp in addition to revenue per MSM, as we see the 
benefit of 5G going to our portfolio.

Brett Simpson
Analyst, Arete Research Services LLP Q
Thanks very much. Cristiano, I just have a quick couple of questions. Maybe first off on the on the 5G outlook for 
calendar 2020, you're talking about 200 million units at the midpoint. And I know other chip makers have reported 
in the last week or so. They're talking more like 300 million units globally for 5G next year. I just wanted to delve a 
little bit into your assumptions. Are you expecting the large flagship launches next year to be only 5G, or do you 
expect global flagships to also be 4G in that outlook? And anything you can tell us about what your assumptions 
are for China within that 5G outlook you've given would be very helpful. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Excellent question. So let me break that down. As we said earlier in this earnings call, I think Akash also 
mentioned this. We are assuming existing market dynamics, and I think that's why you probably see somewhat of 
a more conservative estimate.
If you believe that there's pent-up demand for 5G devices, and it's kind of consistent with what are the transitions, 
you could have a change in replacement rates, and that's going to drive a bigger market. Bigger market is even 
better news for QUALCOMM. So we're just assuming existing market dynamics in our projections.
Now going back to the outlook on 2020, we talk a lot about the dynamics on Q2. But maybe to add to the prior 
question, you should expect as we get into the second half of 2020, then we're going to see the addition of Apple 
volumes. And so you should think about really a 5G ramp for QUALCOMM in 2020.
Your last question was about China. The order of magnitude of deployment in China is significant. And we said 
during the script that now the projection is 1 million [ph] NOB (00:46:15) or base stations by 2020. That's going to 
drive a very aggressive migration. So China could also be upside if the market dynamics don't hold and you have 
higher replacement rates. And also if you assume that the current Huawei share gains in China, which we're 
assuming as our going assumption, if that changes and get to some more normal levels, that's upside as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Simpson
Analyst, Arete Research Services LLP Q
And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow-up here, just to clarify on the RF front-end side. When you talk about 
modem-to-antenna and 5G, are you also including 4G modules, 4G RF modules, like low band, mid, high band, et 
cetera, or are we really talking about ultra-high band RF?
And also just on millimeter wave because I know there's a lot of investors that are questioning the viability of 
millimeter wave at the moment, what are you doing in your second-generation millimeter wave platforms to 
improve things like battery life, or how do we think performance is going to pick up here? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Cristiano R. Amon
President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Okay, maybe two questions. Let me try to go quickly through them. So the first one is we have been very focused 
in 5G as the entry point. So we have been winning RF front-end in the 5G mid-bands, in the 3.5 bands, in some 
cases in some of the refarmed bands as well and the lower frequencies as well as millimeter wave. It's both. We 
continue to see the incumbents providing the 4G, but I point you to what we're going to see in 2020, especially 
with dynamic spectrum sharing. It's going to be the refarming of existing 4G bands, and we expect that to be an 
extension of our existing 5G RF front-end solution. So that was the first question.

Can you remind me of the second question, on millimeter-wave performance, yes, so as we launch a new 
technology, there are a lot of features that come across the device and the infrastructure, and they don't come all 
day one. So some of the initial – I think battery life or even thermal that was experienced by millimeter wave, in 
the first generation chipsets, they've already been addressed with software updates, and we've seen a full day of 
battery life on existing first-generation chipsets. As we go to the second generation at Snapdragon, we see with a 
cross-process node and evolution of our modern technology also significant improvements in battery life area for 
the millimeter wave footprint as well as thermals.

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srini Pajjuri
Analyst, SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. Q
Thank you, a couple of follow-ups actually. I guess first on the 5G ASP boost, there has been a lot of talk about 
the chipset ASP boost, but I'm just curious. Do you see any benefit on the QTL side? I know I think most of the 4G 
premium phones are probably already hitting your cap. But as we transition to 5G, what sort of benefit, if any, do 
you see on the QTL side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Hi, Srini, this is Akash. Again, going back to history, what has happened from 3G to 4G and previous generations, 
we have seen typically an increase in replacement rates and an increase in ASPs when we go to a new 
generation. So that is certainly something that is possible and maybe even likely with 5G. For our business 
planning purposes, as we said earlier, we are planning based on the market being consistent, and then within that 
having a transition to 5G. So that could be an upside opportunity for us that's not included.
And then you could also see users with low and mid-tier devices upgrade and buy higher tier devices because of 
the increased capability that 5G brings. And that could help QTL ASPs as well. But again, that is not modeled into 
our business at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven M. Mollenkopf

agreements.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Srini Pajjuri
Analyst, SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. Q
Got it. And then, Akash, on the margin front, at QCT, I know you said the margins will improve over the next few 
quarters. But my question is on a like-for-like basis, does 5G give you better margins, meaning if I go back to the 
second half of 2017, I think you hit your 20% – 21% EBIT margin for QCT. At that time, your revenue run rate was 
close to $1 billion. So when we get back to that kind of revenue run rate, do you expect the margins to be higher 
than the 20% – 21%?

Patrick Walsh
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc Q
Sorry about that, I had it on mute. I just have two quick questions. So the first question on the RF side, when you 
hear the traditional RF players, Qorvo, Skyworks, talk, they talk about a change in RF content from either $18 to 
$20 going to $25. And so my question for you, it seems like initially you guys are focused more on that 
incremental $5 to $7. Is that a fair assessment, and is the majority of that $5 to $7 made up by millimeter wave?
And then, if we think about that core $18 to $20 that's been historically there, are you really aiming for these kind 
of refarmed bands? And then I guess within the bands, can you – do you have – I know you have BAW capacity 
via TDK. I wouldn't imagine it's too much just given that Avago and Qorvo have probably I think 80% of the 
capacity out there. So would you be targeting more like low-band pads?

Akash Palkhiwala
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, QUALCOMM, Inc. A
Patrick, in terms of the ASP question you asked, I think the examples you were quoting were for premium tier 
device. Really as you look at different regions and you look at different frequency bands in a given region and tier 
of device, those numbers could be vastly different. So I think it's very difficult to generalize in terms of ASP 
advantages.
The way you should think about that is there's a certain market for RF front-end that exists. With 5G coming in, 
that is going to expand, and it's going to create an opportunity for us to significantly improve our share in the 
market. And then on top of that, as Cristiano mentioned, as DSS happens, dynamic spectrum sharing and bands 
get refarmed to 5G, we'll be able to participate and further expand our revenue opportunity. That's kind of the 
framework you should use.

Yes, thank you. I just want to thank the team, the QUALCOMM team for their hard work and the great execution 
through 2019. 2020 is the year of 5G. I want to thank everybody for their hard work. We're on the cusp of it and 
I'm very excited about it. But thanks, everybody, see you next time.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Seattle Genetics Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference 
Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Peggy Pinkston, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please 
go ahead.

Peggy Pinkston
Vice President-Investor Relations, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to Seattle Genetics' second 
quarter 2020 financial results conference call. With me today are, Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive 
Officer; Chip Romp, Executive Vice President-Commercial US; Todd Simpson, Chief Financial Officer; and Roger 
Dansey, Chief Medical Officer.
Accompanying today's conference call are supporting slides, which you'll find on our website in the Investors 
section, Events & Presentations page. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the line for questions. We aim 
to keep this call to one hour, and so I ask that you limit yourself to one question to give everyone an opportunity to 
participate in Q&A during our call today.
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future or anticipated events and results, 
including the company's 2020 financial outlook, anticipated product sales, revenues, costs and expenses, and 
potential clinical and regulatory milestones, including data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals.
Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking 
statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include the difficulty in forecasting sales, revenues and 
expenses, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical 
development and regulatory approval process. More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by 
Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption Risk Factors included in the company's periodic reports filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended March 31, 2020.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Clay.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thank you, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone. The past few quarters have been a period of remarkable growth 
for Seattle Genetics across the business. We have now extended our commercial portfolio to three drugs with the 
approval of PADCEV in December, followed by the approval of TUKYSA in April. In the second quarter, we 
reported total revenues of $278 million, driven by record product sales comprising ADCETRIS and these two new 
marketed products. In addition, we announced positive topline data from a fourth program, tisotumab vedotin, and 
made strong progress across our pipeline with significant clinical development accomplishments.
I'm proud of the dedication of our team and the important advances we're making to address the unmet medical 
needs of cancer patients even in this time of a global pandemic. Starting with ADCETRIS, we reported net sales

of $168 million in the second quarter and $332 million for the first half of 2020. Based on progress to-date, we're 
maintaining our guidance of full year 2020 ADCETRIS net sales in the range of $675 million to $700 million.
Takeda continues to secure additional approval for ADCETRIS, expanding its availability to patients globally. Most 
recently, ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy was approved in the EU for frontline systemic anaplastic large cell 
lymphoma, and ADCETRIS was approved in China for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic 
ALCL. We believe several ADCETRIS label expansion opportunities lie ahead, which Roger will outline during his 
comments.
Turning now to PADCEV. Net sales in the US was $57 million in the second quarter, an increase of 66% from Q1. 
We and our partner Astellas continue to be pleased with the strong US launch of PADCEV and its robust adoption 
for treatment of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, who previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor in a 
platinum-containing chemotherapy.
We're now providing full-year 2020 guidance of $215 million to $235 million. This reflects our current expectations 
following the strong initial launch of PADCEV. Our vision is that PADCEV becomes a foundation of treatment 
across the spectrum of urothelial cancer. To this end, we're advancing trials in first line metastatic urothelial 
cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer, primarily paired with KEYTRUDA in collaboration with both Astellas 
and Merck. We're also exploring PADCEV in a range of nectin-4 expressing solid tumors and believe that 
PADCEV is well-positioned to become an important global brand.
Our third and newest commercial product is TUKYSA, which was rapidly approved by FDA in mid-April for 
metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastasis. We're very pleased to report 
second quarter TUKYSA revenues of $16 million, following the launch that employed virtual communication 
methods. Under the FDA's Project Orbis program, TUKYSA is now also approved in Switzerland, Singapore and 
Canada. And our submission for approval is under review in Australia. More broadly, the EMA is currently 
reviewing our EU Marketing Authorization Application.
As we look forward to bringing TUKYSA to patients throughout the world, we're continuing to build our
international infrastructure and capabilities. Tuomo Pätsi recently joined us Executive Vice President-Commercial 
International. Tuomo has deep experience in this area, including from Celgene where he was PresidentWorldwide Markets, and joins us most recently from Bristol-Myers Squibb. He will lead our commercial 
organization in Europe and RoW, working together with Chip Romp who will continue to oversee the US 
commercial organization. Both Tuomo and Chip serve on the company's executive committee. In addition to our 
commercial and regulatory progress, we've advanced a broad development program across HER2-positive 
cancers, which Roger will cover during his remarks.
Turning now to our pipeline, in late Q2, we reported positive top line results from the pivotal trial of tisotumab 
vedotin or TV in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. We're developing TV in collaboration with 
Genmab. And together, we plan to discuss these results with the FDA. We've received positive feedback from 
KOLs on our top line results in which they emphasized the significant unmet medical need.
Standard therapies for previously treated metastatic cervical cancer generally result in low response rates, and 
overall survival is measured in months. We plan to present full data from the trial later this year. Beyond the 
approved drugs ADCETRIS, PADCEV, and Roche's Polivy, our TV data additionally illustrates the growing 
importance of our vedotin-based antibody drug conjugates in the treatment of cancer. It was also now GSK's 
belantamab mafodotin which uses our ADC technology that is closely related to vedotin, and recently received the 
positive 12 to nothing ODAC vote.

Our growth plans for the company are broad. We're working to expand the indications for each of our 
commercials brands to help patients in need. To fuel our future growth, Seattle Genetics is advancing more than a 
dozen early-stage assets in clinical and preclinical development. These include novel ADCs as well as 
immunotherapy agents and other targeted approaches to treating cancer. With much to share regarding our 
pipeline, we plan to hold a virtual R&D Day later in 2020, during which we'll provide more details on our expansive 
pipeline and our commitment to bring additional first-in-class or best-in-class therapies to patients in need. Stay 
tuned for more information.
Next, I'll turn the call over to Chip to discuss our commercial activities. Then, Todd will comment on our financial 
results and guidance. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities. Chip?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chip Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Clay. We delivered strong results in the second quarter across the commercial portfolio. We adapted our 
strategy for working remotely, and our reps worked diligently to actively support our customers. Marketing teams 
effectively adjusted the marketing mix to increase digital and peer-to-peer speaker program. Launching two new 
drugs and driving growth with an established brand in a virtual world is a challenge that the commercial team has 
met head on, with creativity and flexibility.
For ADCETRIS, we continue to focus on frontline HL and PTCL, and look forward to the five-year follow-up data 
from ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials later this year. The five-year follow-up data is an established standard, 
and we expect that the durable advantage of ADCETRIS in both of these frontline settings will drive incremental 
share.
We are pleased with the continued strong uptake in our labeled indication for PADCEV. Use is strong in both 
academic and community accounts, and breadth of ordering was robust. We are focused on continuing to grow 
market share at our labeled indication by increasing the number of patients who are treated after progressing on a 
platinum-containing chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. We believe that patients are truly benefiting from 
this first-in-class product. And along with our sales partners, we look forward to building upon the early success of 
PADCEV.
And finally, our latest product, TUKYSA. In the first partial quarter of launch, TUKYSA sales were $16 million. We 
are pleased with the label which includes second and later line metastatic patients with or without brain 
metastases. We are also pleased with the adoption of TUKYSA among both community and academic 
physicians. In this virtual environment, we have driven high awareness for TUKYSA and our field-based staff are 
experiencing good access to customers. We attribute the uptake of TUKYSA to favorable guideline placement, 
rapid inclusion in the treatment pathways, and strong KOL and patient advocacy.
Lastly, I look forward to partnering with Tuomo as we prepare for the ex-US launch of TUKYSA. It is exciting time 
for the company, and for the commercial team, as we make this important product available to patients.
Now, I'll turn the call over the Todd.

Great. Thanks, Chip, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call this afternoon. Today, I'll summarize our financial
results for the second quarter and year-to-date, and then comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. Total 
revenues were $278 million in the second quarter, and $513 million for the year-to-date in 2020. Revenues were 
driven by product sales from our three oncology franchises, which totaled $240 million, up 51% from last year.
Royalty revenues were $31 million in the second quarter and $52 million for the year-to-date in 2020. Growth over 
2019 primarily reflects sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda and, to a lesser degree, royalties on sales of Polivy by 
Roche. Collaboration revenues were $6 million in the second quarter and $22 million through the year-to-date in 
2020. This compares to $36 million and $81 million respectively for the same period in 2019. We've also in 2019 
reflected $38 million of milestone achieved by Takeda that were triggered by EU and other RoW approvals of 
ADCETRIS for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.
Cost of sales increased to $48 million in the second quarter and $78 million for the first six months of the year. 
Cost of sales includes the PADCEV profit share to Astellas, which was $27 million in the second quarter and $43 
million for the year-to-date. In addition, beginning in the second quarter, cost of sales now includes the 
amortization of acquired technology related to the Cascadian acquisition. This is a non-cash component of cost of 
sales that going forward will amount to approximately $6 million per quarter.
R&D expenses were $198 billion in the second quarter with $393 million for the first half of 2020. These are 
increases over 2019, and primarily reflect increased investment across our pipeline that now includes 12 
programs in clinical development. SG&A expenses were $126 million in the second quarter and $248 million for 
the first half of 2020. These are increases over 2019 reflecting commercialization of PADCEV and TUKYSA, and 
our European expansion.
We ended the second quarter with $896 million in cash and investments. This includes $175 million from the sale 
in April of the remaining portion of our Immunomedics shares, which contributed to investment income of $73 
million in the second quarter.
I'll now turn to our financial outlook for 2020. With respect to product sales, as Clay mentioned, we are 
maintaining our ADCETRIS guidance of $675 million to $700 million, and we are providing passive guidance for 
the full-year 2020 in the range of $215 million to $235 million.
Moving on to expenses, we expect 2020 cost of sales to be in a range of $185 million to $205 million. As 
mentioned, this now includes product cost of sales, the profit share payment to Astellas for PADCEV, and the 
amortization of acquired technology related to TUKYSA. Now that we are halfway through the year, we are 
refining our guidance for R&D expenses to a range of $820 million to $870 million, and our guidance for SG&A 
expense remains unchanged.
So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Roger.

Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll focus on our approved products PADCEV, TUKYSA and 
ADCETRIS as well as our late-stage asset, tisotumab vedotin. I'll start with PADCEV, the ADC directed against 
nectin-4. Given the ubiquitous expression of nectin-4 in urothelial cancer, this continues to be the focus of our 
development program. We completed enrollment of two pivotal trials in previously treated metastatic urothelial 
cancer earlier this year. First, a second cohort of the EV-201 trial in patients who have received a PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitor and were not eligible for treatment with cisplatin in the first-line setting. A positive outcome could support

a second indication for PAVCED. And second, a randomized Phase 3 EV-301 trial in patients who have received 
both a platinum-containing regimen and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The primary endpoint is overall survival and 
EV-301 is intended to serve as a confirmatory trial in the United States and support global regulatory approvals.
Switching to first-line metastatic urothelial cancer, we have previously reported promising data combining 
PADCEV and KEYTRUDA, which received FDA breakthrough therapy designation. Based on these findings, we 
are pursuing two pathways to address the unmet need in frontline disease. First, we are enrolling 150 patients 
randomized to receive either PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA or PADCEV alone in cohort K of the EV-103 trial. The 
primary endpoint is objective response rate supported by the key secondary endpoint of duration of response. 
This represents a potential accelerated approval opportunity in cisplatin-ineligible patients.
Second, we are enrolling the randomized Phase 3 EV-302 trial that is intended to support global registrations, and 
now also serves as a potential confirmatory trial in the United States. Together with our Astellas and Merck 
partners, we are re-evaluating the need for two experimental arms in the EV-302 trial. This is due to the strength 
of the PADCEV/KEYTRUDA data and the evolving first line metastatic urothelial cancer landscape. The amended 
trial would focus on evaluating PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA compared to a platinum-containing chemotherapy 
regimen. The dual primary endpoints are progression-free and overall survival. We'll keep you posted as our 
planning evolves.
In non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer, Merck recently added PADCEV to the ongoing randomized 
Phase 3 KEYNOTE 905 trial. This trial is in cisplatin-ineligible patients and will assess PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA, 
given neoadjuvantly prior to cystectomy and then post-operatively as adjuvant therapy. This study is being 
conducted under clinical trial agreement where Seattle Genetics and Astellas are providing PADCEV, and Merck 
continues to fund and operationalize the study. This meaningfully expedites development of the 
PADCEV/KEYTRUDA combination in this setting.
I'll now move on to TUKYSA. As Clay described, we have made rapid regulatory progress in securing several 
approvals based on the remarkable data from the HER2CLIMB trial. To further develop TUKYSA, we are initially 
focused in three HER2-positive therapeutic areas: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other gastrointestinal 
cancers.
In HER2-positive breast cancer, we are conducting a blinded randomized Phase 3 trial called HER2CLIMB-02. 
This study is evaluating TUKYSA in combination with Kadcyla or T-DM1 versus Kadcyla alone in first and secondline metastatic breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases. In addition, TUKYSA plus Kadcyla will be 
compared to Kadcyla alone in the adjuvant breast cancer setting for patients with high risk of relapse.
The Phase 3 double-blind randomized trial called COMPASS HER2 RD will enroll approximately 1,000 patients 
and is being conducted by US cooperative group with support from Seattle Genetics. In colorectal cancer, the 
MOUNTAINEER trial is evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab in third-line patients with HER2-
positive, relapsed metastatic disease. This is intended to support a potential accelerated approval.
And in other GI cancers, a trial is now underway. And in other GI cancers, a trial is now underway, evaluating two 
kinds TUKYSA plus trastuzumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first-line HER-2 positive colorectal, 
gastric, esophageal, and gallbladder cancer. In addition, we plan to initiate a trial in the second-line gastric cancer 
setting later this year.
Beyond these three areas, we are also planning to evaluate TUKYSA in HER-2 mutant to amplified cancers. We 
presented compelling preclinical data at AACR last month, showing that TUKYSA selectively inhibits its tumor

growth in HER-2 mutant models. Additional novel combinations of – trials of TUKYSA with other anti-cancer 
agents are also in planning.
Moving on now to ADCETRIS, we are studying several additional opportunities. We recently initiated a 
randomized Phase 3 trial in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The trial will evaluate the 
combination of ADCETRIS, RITUXAN, and REVLIMID versus RITUXAN and REVLIMID alone in 400 patients. 
While ADCETRIS monotherapy is listed in NCCN treatment guidelines for relapsed CD30-positive DLBCL, this 
Phase 3 trial is intended to support potential label expansion and will enroll patients regardless of the CD30 
expression levels.
We are also enrolling patients in a trial evaluating ADCETRIS plus OPDIVO and chemotherapy in frontline 
Hodgkin lymphoma. We have added cohorts of patients with stage 1 or 2 Hodgkin lymphoma under a clinical 
collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our goal is to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity by limiting the number 
of chemotherapy components in the regimen.
Lastly, I'll turn to tisotumab vedotin. In late June, we reported positive top line results from the innovaTV 204 trial, 
evaluating single agent TV in women with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, who had experienced disease 
progression on or after chemotherapy. The data showed a 24% objective response rate with 8.3 months median 
duration of response. The most common treatment-related adverse events included alopecia, epistaxis, nausea, 
conjunctivitis, fatigue and dry eye. We will be discussing these results with the FDA in consideration of a potential 
BLA submission to support accelerated approval.
We and our partners of Genmab are also advancing clinical trials of TV in other solid tumors, including ovarian, 
lung and head and neck cancers, and in combination with other agents used in the treatment of cervical cancer. 
We believe there may be several opportunities for TV in tissue factor expressing solid tumors, and we are
encouraged by the results from the innovaTV 204 study.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Clay.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Hey, guys, good afternoon and congrats to a very successful second quarter. I just had one for Chip regarding 
TUKYSA. Chip, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more insights on how the initial launch is going 
and what you are seeing on the marketplace in terms of its initial uptake. We see some very favorable feedback 
from physicians, for example, around the second-line label. Are you seeing use there? And how is the drug being 
positioned relative to some other novel agents such as, for example, in HER2?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. Michael, thank you for the question. Chip can provide some color that [ph] you can't (00:24:08). Please 
keep in mind that it is very early in the launch, and was very pleased with uptake. Chip, would you like to make 
some comments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chip Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Absolutely. Thank you for the question. It really is too early in the launch to provide specifics, but we are happy 
with the level of awareness that we're seeing along with the uptake in both the academic and home use settings. 
We're working hard to promote the full label that we have, which includes second and later line metastatic patients 
with or without brain metastases. And again, we're pleased with what we're seeing with regard to update and 
awareness.

Sure. So, thank you for the question. And by the way, we have heard from the operator that there might have 
been some people that were – that got dropped off [indiscernible] (00:25:23). I apologize for any communication 
error that's been going on. Please note, we'll have the whole call on replay at our website. So, I apologize for that.

So, going to your question on guidance, so it's early in the launch of PADCEV, but we did want to provide some 
level of guidance. So far, it's been a very strong uptake. We work really hard at getting this drug to every patient in 
need and working with the doctors and making sure that we could help patients. This is an important drug.
Our guidance shows somewhere between a 35% and a 55% growth rate in the second half, over the first half. So, 
a strong growth rate. Yes, just reported 66% growth from the first quarter to second quarter but that was the first 
launch to the second quarter. And it's certainly not unusual to see the rate of growth begin to slow at launch 
progressing. We're not going to be able to see a 66% growth quarter-to-quarter, but our guidance still shows a 
very strong healthy growth of 35% to 50% over the first half of the year. And we're really pleased with what's 
going on.

Cory Kasimov
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Clay, I guess, I just wanted to ask about your latest 
positive data with TV and I'm curious at this point, now that you have that in-house, what are they gating factors to 
a BLA filing. And can you remind us of how you're thinking about kind of the commercial evolution here in terms of 
the initial opportunity and what you see this potentially growing in to? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So as far as BLA, once we had our data, we're really pleased with our data. This is the collaboration with 
Genmab, and we're excited to be able to really help patients. And some of our data has yet to be put out there. 
But we're very proud of what we're doing in patients that have very little other [indiscernible] (00:27:41) response 
rates that are incredibly low. And so, I think when folks get a chance to see our waterfall plot, [indiscernible] 
(00:27:52) really big positive.
So – but we are actively working along and trying to make sure that we connect with regulators and go towards a 
BLA submission. But we don't have – I don't have information today for you, because it would be not appropriate 
to provide that level of confidential information until I had a discreet thing to say. But you could be certainly 
encouraged by our positive data and you certainly need to know that we are working very hard on this with all the 
appropriate regulators.
Now, you asked another question about the commercial evolution. Sorry, I was looking at my notes here. And this 
is something that – we think that relapsed/refractory cervical cancer market is the beginning for TV. TV is 
something that can absolutely be used in a single agent, but also can be combined with other agents. It is our 
goal to really impact as many patients as we can with relapsed metastatic cervical cancer. And we think the best 
way will be initially from a single agent, but then it's a combination approaches. And so we are certainly working 
on that as we speak.

Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats to the whole team on the really excellent operational 
quarter. So, one question on TUKYSA, the breast cancer ASCO session really highlighted TUKYSA, in fact, it's 
the only HER-2 positive drug that was highlighted. And the KOL was really heavily advocating [indiscernible] 
(00:30:06) earlier lines of breast cancer to prevent, not to treat, but to prevent the occurrence of brain mets. And I 
wanted to understand what the initial launch feedback has been and if the drug is getting used at all in sort of 
second-line metastatic, which is allowable by the label. Thanks so much and congrats again.

No worries. As far as the uptake, that's fantastic. And maybe, Chip, can you give a little bit of color on to the 
market dynamics and make some comments? And then, can you turn it over to Roger to talk about treating and 
how we're looking at the treatment paradigms, et cetera? So, Chip, can you go ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chip Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. Absolutely, Clay. Thanks. So, yeah, we've seen significant [indiscernible] (00:31:02) regarding TUKYSA. 
Doctors have viewed it as a valuable addition to the treatment tools that they have for these patients. And again, 
we're only promoting [indiscernible] (00:31:12), which it doesn't include second and later line patients with or 
without brain mets. But again, we've been happy with the adoption that we're seeing.

And I'll add some commentary here. It's Roger. So, the data that was presented at ASCO is remarkable. This is 
probably the largest data set looking at patients with brain metastases in a perspective fashion. And so, 
TUKYSA's direct treatment effect on brain metastases and really what represents a secondary prevention 
outcome which is people who do not progress any further having had brain metastases compared to control. So, I

think we've shown convincingly that TUKYSA is a very relevant treatment for patients with brain metastases. And 
as you pointed out, the label does allow uses in the same place that one would expect a drug like Kadcyla to be 
used.
We think we have comparative data. Again, the HER2CLIMB dataset is as strong as I think we would ever expect 
it to be with overall survival, and various other endpoints strongly hit. So, we have a good value proposition to 
bring forward to physicians and patients as they think about what treatment they should consider in the metastatic 
space.

Chad Messer
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Great. Congratulations on a good quarter, and thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could take us 
through innovaTV 205 in maybe a little bit more detail. I know you're – it's kind of a multi-arm trial, you've got a lot 
of different combos as well as single agents you're looking at. But I believe as the slides flashed by, I caught that 
that was relapsed as well as treatment-naive. Can you kind of just sort of confirm what you're trying to get out of 
that trial? And is this one that we might be able to think of as confirmatory assuming you're allowed to file 
accelerated? Thank you.

Hey, Chad. Roger, would you take that question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So it's a question essentially around cervical cancer, and we are revaluating. We are looking obviously to 
understand where tisotumab vedotin may have a role whether it's as a single agent or in combination, for 
example, with pembrolizumab and/or other chemotherapy. The trial is not set up as a confirmatory trial, I would 
say. It's still a signal finding trial to work out both on a combination basis and along with therapy basis and also a 
schedule basis as to whether there's – what a path forward beyond the – a single agent TV data that we've shown 
with TV 204 represents for cervical cancer.

Sure. Thank you for the question on muscle invasive bladder cancer. It's something a very big interest to us. 
Roger, can you make a specific comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. Thanks for the question. The original designs or the cohorts we've set up in EV-103 were signal finding 
cohorts. So, we needed to understand what EV monotheraphy could look like in a muscle invasive bladder 
population, and that's focused on cis-ineligible. And we also needed to try and understand what a 
PADCEV/KEYTRUDA combination could look like.
However, we have such strong activity with PADCEV in later lines. Plus, we have very strong data in metastatic 
disease with a combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA. It really was no difficult leap of faith for us to actually 
move that combination into a randomized trial. So as part of my remarks, I made the comment that this has really 
leapfrogged us into a rapid development path for PADCEV in muscle-invasive bladder cancer in cis-ineligible 
space. So, those two cohorts will still run. We will generate the data, but we've already basically moved into a 
Phase 2 trial.

Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Thanks. Congrats on the commercial execution across the board. I was wondering, if you guys could give some 
color on the PADCEV usage. We're hearing some docs were using KEYTRUDA on the frontline. I was wondering 
how extensive that is, and whether you think that NCCN endorsement will be imminent, [indiscernible] (00:36:43) 
potential reimbursement concerns.
And then, just one other one, just – I know it's early in the launch, but just to get some sense of how long patients 
were staying on the drug.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, thank you, Andy, for the questions. So, first of all, on the front-line plus KEYTRUDA, obviously, we can't make 
comments about off-label use and spontaneous adoption in that regard. Clearly, our data with KEYTRUDA were 
very powerful and that enabled us to speak with regulators, and we were able to negotiate not only a large 
confirmatory trial that's global, but an accelerated trial that's for – with 150 patients, with 75 patients with 
PADCEV, and 75 patients with PADCEV plus KEYTRUDA, which is well underway. And we're excited with that as 
an opportunity in frontline. So – and maybe, Roger, before we go further on this question, do you want to make 
comment about PADCEV in the frontline and how we're looking at this?

Sure. So the frontline, the frontline space is dynamic. It's complex. There are biomarkers involved. There's the 
issue of cis-ineligible eligible versus cis-eligible patients. But we have a two-pronged plan, and we think we really 
are covering the waterfront very carefully. So the first cohort that Clay outlined is our fastest path, because it's a 
single arm trial. We're enrolling. That cohort has been open since January, and its primary outcome is overall 
objective response rate together with duration of response. So, that's an outcome that we look forward to, 
obviously, as soon as we have the available data, we've enrolled everyone.
The second piece, which is this much larger randomized global trial, which is basically takes on all patients, 
whether they're cis-eligible or not is also a very important component. And really, what we plan to do now is to 
simplify our approach. So, this is now going to be a passive KEYTRUDA plan for frontline bladder cancer 
metastatic disease, regardless really of eligibility for platinum or not, regardless of PD-L1 status and so on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
The second part of your question, Andy, is about staying on drug and all that. It's a little early to be really making 
specific comments on that. I think it behooves us to look at the duration of therapy for a longer period of time to 
start making specific things. But I will say that our goal with PADCEV is to be the standard of care within our label, 
and we are well on the way to that. And that's a big – it's a big statement, it's hard to quantify that. But with what 
we've done with a 66% increase in sales from the first quarter which were very strong, we're very proud of this. 
We're getting it out and we're helping patients. Doctors are relying on and we're hearing more of them, all this the 
standard of care. So that's something that's important for this.
And we're just so that you know, as we think about patients staying on drug, we have had no pushback from 
payer, okay? And that's a very strong acknowledgement toward the value proposition that PADCEV brings. And it 
is something that we're really proud of. And, Chip, do you have any other market dynamic comments you want to 
make about PADCEV and how it's being used?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chip Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
No, Clay. We're promoting the full breadth of the label that we have. And again, [indiscernible] (00:40:44) that I 
would add to that is your commentary on the payer [indiscernible] (00:40:46) very strong endorsement for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Okay. I appreciate it. What about the NCCN process? Any color on how that's going?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
We work obviously with NCCN. We have many, many different NCCN listings for our different products. And 
sometimes, we get favorable guidelines and pathways placements, and that's important. And we certainly have 
heard some oncologists who want to use PADCEV in different ways such as in – those who have received PD1 or
PD-L1s in a frontline setting, but they aren't eligible for platinum, so that's a little different. And we've heard about 
some of those, it's not a common practice. But we hear. We have our ears glued to talking to oncologists and 
trying to figure out everything that we possibly can. As far as the NCCN, that is really up to them. We don't really 
have a say in this matter, but we provide lots of information for NCCN on any of our products all the time. So 
that's something we look for.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jay Olson
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Hey, congrats on all the success, and thank you for taking my question. The TV topline data were extremely 
impressive. And I was curious about what we should look for when you present the detailed results from innovaTV 
204 later this year. And then for the basket trial, can you comment on which tumor types beyond cervical you're 
most optimistic about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So I mentioned before that I was really proud of the TV top line data. Historically, with metastatic cervical 
cancer, you have drugs that are 8% to 12% objective response rate in this setting. So, really poor. The most 
recent drug that got approval in metastatic cervical cancer was KEYTRUDA. And it's only in PD-1 high, not in all 
patients. And it was 14%, one-four, response rate. And so you could just see from that how difficult it is to treat 
this very tough disease. And so, we're excited about that. And maybe, Roger, you could talk a little bit about 
what's exciting about the topline data. I mentioned earlier the waterfall plot, but what they can look for in a trial 
and maybe you could talk about the main types in the basket trial we're looking at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So as I've pointed out, the historical benchmark that we would be measured against, obviously, there are 
different data sets that you can use, but the results of existing therapies are not great. So low-double digits or 
thereabouts would be an expected outcome, probably quite a good outcome. Being able to generate data in the 
close to mid-20% response rate, we think, is an important event, and as important is durability. We're really very 
excited by the median duration of response that we've been able to show.
Obviously, when we present the data, we will provide other endpoints, other planned endpoints and the entire 
safety profile. But we think we have a good case to make. It's the agency's determination as to whether they 
agree with us, but we will certainly put our best foot forward because this is such an area of high unmet need.
We do see that TV 204 is sort of validating for the tissue factor targets. And so, obviously, when we're working in 
other tumors, the possibility exists as it does with an ADP platform in general, that we might find another tumor or 
two that are potentially responsive. So in that basket trial, we have pancreatic cancer, we have colorectal cancer, 
we have non-small cell lung cancer, and we have head and neck cancer. I think we're particularly interested in the 
latter two. We find – and obviously, we haven't presented any data, but that would be those two cohorts of 
interest.
And then, we've already shown TV already is active in ovarian cancer. So, we have a whole ovarian cancer effort 
going on. And obviously, we haven't disclosed any of the information for the current data. But we are prosecuting 
TV in a broad fashion not only to determine its role in cervical cancer, but also potential role in those other tumors.

Todd E. Simpson

Yeah. Great. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. So, I just want to be clear, we reduced our guidance just a 
little bit. We brought it down a little bit and we narrowed it. It's a bit of a mid-year refinement, but we are – despite 
the incredible progress that we're making with expanding clinical trials and bringing new drugs into clinic, the 
guidance update is reflecting some lower clinical cost related to COVID, particularly in some of the harder hit 
areas. We also are seeing decreases in traveling. Congresses and scientific meetings that have – as I think 
everyone knows, has gone virtual. We've had a very strong presence at these events that obviously no one is 
traveling. And just we changed SG&A guidance, but we're seeing some similar range in SG&A, but sort of counter 
balancing that was the earlier-than-planned launch of TUKYSA. We're about to [indiscernible] (00:47:17) and 
we're now really building out our European capabilities [indiscernible] (00:47:24) launch of the drug [indiscernible]

I'm sorry. Hold on. Okay. TV. So, we're really – we're excited about TV and going forward. Roger, would you like 
to discuss a little bit about the combinations we're thinking of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So, for TV, we're generating data. We do think – just to come back to sort of general vedotin platform, we 
have pretty strong scientific rationale of combining a vedotin ADC together with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. It's 
based on vedotin payload, essentially inducing immunogenic cell death, which I think is an important mechanism, 
which one can increase that sort of the immune profile of the tumor. But not only killing the cancer cells, but 
adding a sort of adjuvant [indiscernible] (00:49:30) to the immune system, we think is a plus. So a lot of our focus 
is combining of with a PD-1, but we're also interested, obviously, if there are reasons to combine with 
chemotherapy, we need to test that. So, that is what we are testing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, as far as TUKYSA and the patient populations, we're definitely treating both patients that have brain 
metastasis and those that do not. So, both are being treated and we're out there in the community. We're out 
there in major medical centers, universities. So, it's been getting brought uptick. And I'm sure you're hearing that 
as you talk to docs out there. But we're really pleased with what happened with TUKYSA so far. And we look 
forward to having a great future with this exciting product and really helping patients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Connor Meehan

Understood. Thank you. And sorry, just to – on the first question, would it also be possible to touch base on your

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I'm sorry. TIGIT. I'm sorry TGT. Sorry. I wasn't sure. It's kind of hard, a little muffled. Yeah, absolutely. So, okay. 
Yeah. So, our TIGIT antibody utilizes our SEA technology. And what that does is that results in non-fucosylated 
human IgG 1 antibody, okay? And that's really important. Now, the preclinical data says that SEA-TIGIT or SEATGT has potential differentiated profile versus other TIGITs. And I could get into that, if you want to. But it's very –
we're very excited. The pre-clinical data is incredibly strong package. And the Phase 1 data has already started.

And it's in a variety of different tumors. So we think this compares very well with the leaders now which are Roche

Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Oh, great. Congratulations on another spectacular quarter, and I hope everybody is well at Seattle Genetics. So, 
my question has to do with the Phase 3 relapsed/refractory DLBCL trial. Could you remind us the ADCETRIS' 
activity in that setting? Is there any sort of significant difference between the ADC and DCB subtype? I remember 
that lenalidomide appears to be more active in an ADC subtype. So, kind of in the context of combination, is there 
an enrollment strategy to enrich for the ADC population that you can optimally capture that effect? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Andy, thank you for, first of all, saying that our quarter was spectacular. I think when you have a 66% increase in 
PADCEV, and a big first quarter with TUKYSA way past where Wall Street had thought we'd be, we were very 
proud of that. So thank you for using the word spectacular.
As far as treating with ADCETRIS in DLBCL and subtypes [indiscernible] (00:53:06), I'm going to turn it over to 
Roger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Andy. Well, we are – we do have [indiscernible] (00:53:14) NCCN listings for use of ADCETRIS for 
DLBCL. And you are right, there is a suggestion that perhaps REVLIMID is focused on one subtype versus the 
other. But we are enrolling all patients, and this is – it's not only all subtypes of lymphomas, but also from a PD30 
expression level perspective. We believe that we have a good shot at showing activity for ADCETRIS in PD30-
negative population by standard IHC and there's lots a of discussion one can have around why that may be so.
So, the trial is designed really as an all-comers in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, combining REVLIMID together with 
ADCETRIS and with RITUXAN, and we expect that the population obviously from a subgroup perspective will 
evaluate as the trial reads outs if there are any potential subgroups are better than others. But I think our
expectation is we should see a treatment effect of this combination sort of across the different types of DLBCL.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on a great quarter. I was wondering, if you could give us 
some insight into what's going on with TUKYSA. I mean, you guys – this is probably one of the first virtual 
launches ever. Granted, yes, there was pretty great awareness among the physician community, but what do you

Sure. So, essentially TUKYSA represents a best-in-class TKI. So it doesn't arrive at clinician desks and for 
patients in the absence of other class molecules. But it does deliver on the promise of what a small molecule 
inhibitor can do. And I think we've had the good fortune of having a very prominent presentation at San Antonio in 
December, where I think the data was well appreciated. We then followed that up with a second presentation at 
ASCO, again, incredibly strong data, plus a favorable label. So from the point of view of sharing information at 
public fora and in terms of what the label would recommend for potential use for TUKYSA, I think we couldn't 
honestly have gotten to a better place than we have now.

Chip, you'd like to touch base on market dynamics?

Chip Romp
Executive Vice President-Commercial U.S., Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Absolutely, Clay. So, I think the team has done a great job adapting to the virtual communication. Our customers 
have been receptive to that. And we also rapidly grew from one product to three. So, there's been some synergies 
on the commercial team working to grab – collaborating together across the brands, and our customers have 
appreciated that as well. We've also began a phased reintroduction, a face to face interaction with some of our 
customers. We've been working hard to make sure that [indiscernible] (00:56:56).

Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. and congratulations on an awesome quarter. I guess my 
question is mainly regarding TUKYSA being reviewed in the EU. Can you give us some color as to how that's 
going, when we might hear regarding an EU approval? And I guess importantly this new international sales force, 
can you talk a little bit about that, how it looks over time and how we should be thinking about the rest of the world 
ex-US and ex-EU?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, thanks for the question very much so. So, we – first of all, we have submitted in the Project Orbis countries, 
and that was the first thing that we did through the FDA program. And that includes Switzerland and Singapore 
and Australia, US and Canada. So, we are launched in one of the Project Orbis countries today, which is the US, 
but the others are coming. We are approved in many of them and launch is on its way in these. And so, we're 
really excited about Project Orbis that has – we're preparing to launch it there.
As far as in the EU, we are working very closely with regulators there. It is something we're right on top of it. We 
announced the hiring of Tuomo Pätsi, who will lead our ex-US commercial organization, and Tuomo will report 
directly to me and sit on the executive committee, and Chip, who is on this call, will report directly to me as well 
and cover the US. So, Tuomo and Chip will basically cover the globe for a commercial team and both report to 
me, both sit on our executive committee. Both have tremendous experience.
So, we're really excited to integrate our thinking to make it global in our future plans. And so when you look at 
Europe, we're well on our way with the EMA with what we're doing. We hired country managers all over the place, 
Germany, France, everywhere. We're getting ready for a European launch for sure.
As far as Asia goes, we have met with many countries in Asia, especially the big countries: the China, Japan, and 
some others. And in Asia generally, you need to have small bridging studies. And we've heard from these 
regulators in Asian countries, and what we need exactly and we've – so we've already negotiated the exact 
bridging studies, and we're well on our way to initiating those. So we've made great progress in Europe, great 
progress in Asia, and with Project Orbis actually have gotten quite a few approvals and getting ready to do those 
launches. So, we're really thinking about TUKYSA in a strong way internationally.

Analyst, JMP Securities LLC Q
Great. And just if I could just follow up, is there a significant expansion in terms of the international sales force or 
the sales – how should we think be thinking about the numbers of salespeople?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. We haven't shared any specifics of how many salespeople, but we certainly are building a sales force in the 
Greater Europe region at this point. And so, we just haven't given specifics yet. As we get closer to things, we'll 
get more specifics and Todd will give some financial guidance to that. But stay tuned for that. That's coming.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our final question from Joe Catanzaro from Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Catanzaro
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q
Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here, and congrats on yet another solid quarter. Just a question on EV202. I know that trial just kicked off this past March. But wondering if you could speak to the pace of enrollment 
you're seeing, whether that's aided by the strength of EV and data in bladder cancer? And then along these lines, 
is there any degree of dose binding in that trial and any consideration of looking at EV pembro in a basket tumor 
setting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Roger – I think Roger should address this. We don't normally talk about enrollment. I could tell you, we are 
enrolling and it's going well, but Roger could talk a little bit about the trial and what we're thinking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So, it's sort of on first principles because EV or PADCEV is so active in bladder cancer in nectin-4 
expression. It's high on other tumors. There's a real chance, but obviously, we have to generate the data, but the 
basket trial could potentially give us another tumor. And that work is ongoing. And so, obviously, we can't talk in 
details, but from a – again, from a sort of first principles of drug development, ADCs are great with monotherapies 
typically in later line. But once you move into earlier lines, one generally needs combinations and we think we've 
actually found a really strong combination partner with a PD-1 inhibitor. So one could imagine that the basket trial 
does, in fact, find a signal in a particular tumor that we would develop it as a monotherapy and we would also look 
for combinations and the most obvious one to go through would be a combination, for example, a PD-1 inhibitor.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Seattle Genetics Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference 
Call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Peggy Pinkston, Vice President Investor Relations. Ma'am, 
please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peggy Pinkston
Vice President-Investor Relations, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to Seattle Genetics third quarter 
2019 conference call. With me today are Clay Siegall, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Taylor, Chief 
Commercial Officer; Todd Simpson, Chief Financial Officer; and Roger Dansey, Chief Medical Officer.
Accompanying today's conference call are supporting slides which are available on our website in the Investors 
Section, Events & Presentations page. Following our prepared remarks today, we'll open the line for questions. 
We ask that you limit yourself to one to two questions to ensure we're able to get to everybody during our call 
today.
Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial and 
operating performance of the company such as those, among others, relating to the company's 2019 financial 
outlook including anticipated 2019 ADCETRIS sales and future revenues, costs and expenses, and the 
company's anticipated timing to achieve potential future clinical and regulatory milestones including data 
readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals.
Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking 
statements. Among the factors that may cause such a difference include the difficulty in forecasting sales, 
revenues and expenses, and the uncertainty associated with the pharmaceutical development and regulatory 
approval process. More information about the risks and uncertainties based by Seattle Genetics is contained 
under the caption Risk Factors included in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, including the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Peg, and good afternoon, everyone. Seattle Genetics has reached a transformational point in its history. 
We are poised to bringing multiple targeted therapies to cancer patients in need. Our progress is evidenced by 
significant milestones across our oncology portfolio including several in only the past two months.
First, ADCETRIS is a leading lymphoma brand that continues to grow, with record revenues of $462 million yearto-date, up 34% from the first nine months of 2018. Under our collaboration with Takeda, ADCETRIS is on pace 
to exceed $1 billion in global sales in 2019.

In addition, ADCETRIS remains the focus of a substantial clinical development program. At ASH in December, 10 
abstracts will feature ADCETRIS in Hodgkin and T-cell lymphomas including the four-year follow-up from the 
ECHELON-1 trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma.
Next, in our late-stage pipeline is enfortumab vedotin or EV which we are developing in collaboration with 
Astellas. During the quarter, we submitted a BLA for EV in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients, 
and it was filed by the FDA with priority review with an action date of March 15, 2020. If approved, EV would be 
our second marketed product and expand our commercial portfolio into solid tumors. Our EV US sales force is in 
place, and we are looking forward to bringing this drug to patients in need.
In parallel, we and Astellas are advancing a robust clinical development program for EV across the spectrum of 
urothelial cancer including a planned Phase 3 trial in first-line metastatic patients. Roger will provide more detail 
about the impressive data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Conference and our 
development plans for EV.
Our next late-stage clinical program is tucatinib. Last week, we reported exciting results from our HER2CLIMB 
pivotal trial of tucatinib in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer including patients with brain metastasis. Trial 
was a success and achieved as primary and two key secondary endpoints. Full results will be presented at the 
San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December.
The data further support tucatinib as a potential best-in-class HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our team is already 
preparing the NDA, which we plan to submit to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020. This would put tucatinib in line 
to become our third marketed product. The HER2CLIMB data also support our continued investment in the 
tucatinib clinical development program in earlier lines of HER2-positive breast cancer and in other solid tumors 
such as colon cancer.
Tisotumab vedotin or TV is a late-stage program we are developing in collaboration with Genmab. Our initial 
focus is a recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. We expect to report top-line data from the TV pivotal trial called 
innovaTV 204 in the first half of 2020.
Lastly, investing in our early-stage pipeline is a key part of our strategy for future growth. We are advancing 
multiple programs in ongoing clinical trials including ladiratuzumab vedotin or LV. We plan to report initial data at 
SABCS from an ongoing clinical trial of LV plus pembrolizumab in triple-negative breast cancer patients. We will 
continue to advance innovative new product candidates into clinical trials including ADCs and other targeted 
therapies with several INDs these planned in 2020.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Robin to discuss our commercial activities. Then Todd will comment on our 
financial results and 2019 guidance. After that, Roger will discuss our clinical development activities. Robin?

Thanks, Clay. ADCETRIS net sales in US and Canada were $167.6 million in the third quarter, an increase of 
32% compared to the same quarter in 2018, and an increase of 5% over the second quarter of 2019. Continuing 
growth in Q3 reflected an increase in the overall share of frontline PTCL patients treated with ADCETRIS and a 
sustained share in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma. The PTCL growth was highest among newly diagnosed ALCL 
patients with a significant majority receiving ADCETRIS. Our sales organization is focused on continuing to 
promote ADCETRIS under its broad label that now includes six indications.

They're also emphasizing the three-year PFS data from the ECHELON-1 trial in order to continue to shift adoption 
for advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The data showed that with extended follow-ups the PFS benefit 
was maintained with ADCETRIS plus AVD. We're narrowing our 2019 ADCETRIS sales guidance to $625 million 
to $640 million.
Now I would like to transition to enfortumab vedotin. We are encouraged by the positive reaction from 
investigators and key opinion leaders to the EV-201 data that was presented at ASCO. There were significant 
unmet need in metastatic urothelial cancer post platinum chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy and we look 
forward to providing a new option for patients.
We are actively preparing for the potential approval and commercial launch of EV. The EV sales team is fully on 
board and in the final phase of training to ensure that we are ready to launch upon FDA approval.
Our sales organization was hired from 18 different companies in addition to Seattle Genetics and has an average 
of 14 years of oncology experience. Our team is also actively engaging with key payers to provide them with
information that will help them plan and budget for future coverage and/or reimbursement decisions related to EV. 
We are working in close collaboration with our partner Astellas to ensure the joint commercial team is launch 
ready.
Moving on to tucatinib, the commercial team is excited by the results from HER2CLIMB. We have been preparing 
launch plans in anticipation of the data that we announced last week. Hiring of the US sales leadership team has 
already been initiated with a focus on deep expertise in the breast cancer space. I'm confident that we will have a 
highly experienced tucatinib sales force in place in advance of approval.
In summary, ADCETRIS is the mainstay of our business and we continue to focus on expanding our newer 
indications of frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL. We look forward to potential approvals and launches of EV 
and tucatinib and to making a difference in the lives of cancer patients.
Now I'll turn over the call to Todd.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Robin, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. Today, I'll summarize our 
financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date and provide a few updates to our financial outlook for the 
year.
Total revenues were $213 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $627 million for the year-to-date. This included 
record ADCETRIS net sales in the US and Canada of $168 million in the third quarter and $462 million for the 
year-to-date.
Royalty revenues in the third quarter of this year increased to $27 million compared to $23 million in the third 
quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, royalty revenues were $66 million compared to $59 million for 
the same period last year. Royalty revenues primarily reflect ADCETRIS sales by Takeda and, to a lesser extent, 
sales of Polivy under our collaboration with Roche.
Collaboration revenues were $18 million in the third quarter and $99 million for the first nine months of 2019. This 
included the earned portion of $43 million in milestones achieved earlier this year, most notably triggered by 
Takeda's approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and the recent approval of Polivy.

R&D expenses were $196 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $518 million for the year-to-date. Growth over 
2018 reflects higher investment across our pipeline, primarily on our late-stage programs tucatinib, EV and TV, as 
well as the upfront cost of a preclinical asset that we acquired in the third quarter.
SG&A expenses were $96 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $259 million in the first nine months of the year. 
These are both increases over 2018 and reflect commercial efforts to support ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin 
lymphoma and PTCL, launch preparation activities for EV, and costs related to supporting our other late-stage 
pipeline programs.
We ended the third quarter with $870 million in cash and investments, which includes net proceeds of $549 
million from our July common stock offering. In addition, we hold approximately $102 million in Immunomedics 
common stock. These shares are mark-to-market and contributed to a small investment loss for the quarter and 
year-to-date this year, but created some variability in results in 2018.
Lastly, I want to highlight four updates to our financial outlook. On revenues, we are narrowing our ADCETRIS net 
sales guidance to a range of $625 million to $640 million. In addition, based on strong sales by Takeda, we are 
increasing our expectations for royalty revenues to a range of $90 million to $95 million.
On expenses, we are updating our R&D expense guidance to a range of $690 million to $715 million. This reflects 
the technology acquisition that I referred to earlier, as well as development activities for EV and tucatinib.
And lastly, following the positive HER2CLIMB results last week, we expect to initiate several launch preparation 
activities this year for tucatinib. As a result, we are increasing our SG&A expense guidance to a range of $355 
million to $370 million. We plan to provide our 2020 financial guidance on our next quarter call.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc.
Thanks, Todd, and good afternoon, everyone. The past few months have been remarkably productive. This 
afternoon I will recap key outcomes and activities in our late-stage program and highlight our development plans 
going forward to maximize the potential of these programs for patients in need.
I'll begin with enfortumab vedotin. Positive data from the pivotal EV-201 trial in metastatic urothelial cancer 
patients who received prior platinum chemotherapy and PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment were presented at ASCO and 
published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The data supported our Biologics License Application that was 
submitted to the FDA in July, and was accepted for filing by FDA in September with a PDUFA date of March 15, 
2020.
We and our partners at Astellas are actively engaged with FDA in support of the application. As a reminder, EV 
previously received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA in this patient population.
Beyond our initial registration pathway, our development plans are evaluating EV in the first-line metastatic 
setting, as well as in earlier stages of the disease. This is supported by initial results from the Phase 1 EV-103 
trial presented at ESMO in September, where we reported data from 45 metastatic urothelial cancer patients who 
were previously untreated and were ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Cisplatin ineligible patients typically receive a carboplatin regimen, which is associated with a response rate of 
approximately 36%. The study met outcomes for safety and in addition among those patients who received a 
combination of EV and pembrolizumab, the objective response rate was 71% including a 13% complete response 
rate. A total of 93% of patients had reduction in tumor volume. The combination of EV and pembrolizumab 
showed a manageable safety and tolerability profile. Importantly, we observed responses regardless of PD-L1 
expression.
Treatment-related adverse events of clinical interest that were Grade 3 or greater were rash, hypoglycemia, and 
peripheral neuropathy. These were expected events and the rates were similar to those observed with 
enfortumab vedotin monotherapy. 11% of patients had treatment-related immune mediated adverse events of 
clinical interest greater than or equal to Grade 3 that required the use of systemic steroids. This was consistent 
with the safety profile observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy, which does not appear to worsen with the 
addition of EV.
Based on these data, we are proposing to conduct a frontline, randomized Phase 3 trial. We will provide 
additional specifics about our Phase 3 plans in the coming months.
EV plus pembrolizumab represents a second encouraging dataset that has been generated from the combination 
of a vedotin-based ADC and a checkpoint inhibitor. We have previously shown promising data from the 
combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab in several lymphoma settings. We believe in the potential of combining 
our vedotin-based ADCs with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and we are evaluating similar combination across our 
ADC pipeline.
The EV-103 trial is ongoing in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer patients to evaluate the combination of EV and 
platinum chemotherapy, as well as the triplet of EV, pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. In addition, we recently 
expanded the trial to evaluate EV monotherapy and the combination of EV and pembrolizumab in patients with 
muscle invasive urothelial cancer who are cisplatin ineligible.
Approximately 20% urothelial cancer patients are diagnosed with muscle invasive disease which is not yet spread 
outside of liver. There is a significant unmet need for new therapies for these patients.
Lastly, the activity of EV in urothelial cancer suggests it may have application in other Nectin-4-expressing 
malignancies. To that end, we and Astellas plan to start a signal-finding trial in other solid tumors in the near 
future.
I'll move on now to tucatinib, our oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2. Last week, we reported positive 
top-line results from the randomized, double-blind pivotal trial called HER2CLIMB. The trial was conducted in 612 
heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients, including 47% who are known to have brain 
metastases by the entry. Patients received either tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine or 
trastuzumab and capecitabine alone.
We reported a statistically significant and clinically meaningful outcome on the primary and two key secondary 
endpoints. The data shows that the tucatinib regimen reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 
approximately half and by a greater amount in the patients of brain metastases. Most importantly, tucatinib also 
reduce the risk of death by a third in the overall population.

Tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was generally well tolerated with a manageable 
safety profile. Full results from HER2CLIMB are scheduled for an oral presentation at SABCS on December 11, 
2019, and we expect to submit a new drug application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020.
Next, I'll turn to ADCETRIS, which we are evaluating in several new trials for potential registration or to inform 
clinical practice. As previously stated, we are enrolling patients who are being retreated with ADCETRIS in 
Hodgkin and T-cell lymphoma who progressed after prior response, including those who received ADCETRIS in 
the frontline setting.
We are also conducting a trial of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL patients who are unfit for 
combination chemotherapy.
In addition to these studies, we recently expanded an ongoing Phase 2 trial to evaluate ADCETRIS in a novel 
combination with nivolumab, adriamycin and dacarbazine in newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin lymphoma 
patients. This regimen excludes vinblastine, which is part of the approved ADCETRIS plus AVD regimen and 
adds nivolumab. Vinblastine is known to cause neuropathy and ADCETRIS in combination with nivolumab has 
produced promising data in several clinical trials.
Combining the two most active agents in Hodgkin lymphoma, ADCETRIS and the PD-1 inhibitor in a frontline 
regimen, has the potential to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. A trial reflects our long-term strategy to improve 
outcomes for Hodgkin lymphoma patient with ADCETRIS-based regimens.
Another ADCETRIS opportunity we are exploring is its use in the treatment of diffused large B-cell lymphoma. 
We'll keep you posted as our plans progress. We also have a number of important presentations at ASH and look 
forward to continuing to expand the ADCETRIS dataset in hematologic malignancies.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Clay.

Thanks, Roger. Before we open the line for your questions, I want to recap our key upcoming activities across our 
oncology portfolio. They include first, continue to establish ADCETRIS as the standard of care in the frontline 
Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline PTCL, and initiating additional clinical trials. Second, working with FDA on our 
EV submission in collaboration with Astellas towards the March 2020 PDUFA date, initiating a Phase 3 trial in 
frontline urothelial cancer and expanding the EV development program with new trials.
Third, reporting tucatinib HER2CLIMB data at SABCS, submitting an NDA to the FDA in the first quarter of 2020 
and advancing a randomized trial in combination with T-DM1. And reporting top-line results from the TV pivotal 
trial in cervical cancer in the first half of next year. We aim to continue our positive momentum through 2019 and 
into 2020 as we strive to bring important new drugs to cancer patients.
At this point, we'll open the line for Q&A. Operator, please open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Schmidt with 
Guggenheim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Thanks for taking my questions. I actually had a pipeline question on ladiratuzumab. As you mentioned that's 
rightfully so I think a lot of excitement around combining your ADCs with PD-1 inhibitors, and you did mention the 
upcoming presentation of the KEYTRUDA combination study at SABCS. I was just wondering if you could help us 
a little bit more with what investor expectations should be with respect to this update from LV plus pembro that's 
coming up here later this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Michael, thank you for the question. So, we are very interested in the LIV-1 ADC, it's an interesting molecule, it's 
certainly active. We've shown that and presented that it has single-agent activity, and we are continuing to 
evaluate it as a monotherapy and also in combination with pembro. We are not yet ready to go forward and 
announce registration of Phase 3 trials, but we are continuing to develop it and trying to maximize dose schedule 
monotherapy, combination with pembro and we're very excited about that.
Clearly, SABCS will be from a Seattle Genetics standpoint a big show on tucatinib, because we have a lot to 
discuss there. But LIV-1 is also important to us and additionally, I may point out that the basket trials, a trial in a 
variety of different tumor types that have LIV-1 expression has recently opened. So that's something we're 
working on as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Schmidt
Analyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC Q
Great. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up. So you mentioned the upcoming trial results for the TV study in cervical 
cancer from the innovaTV 204 trial. Can you just remind us of expectations for what the clinical bar is here in 
terms of efficacy to – for approvability?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
There's a lot there, and maybe I'll give you a few comments, but Roger can also follow-up. And if you look at 
relapsed cervical cancer, it's a grim prognosis. No one survives this. This is bad. And despite GARDASIL and 
vaccines, not everyone gets vaccine across the globe and in the US. And so, there's still, unfortunately, a need for 
therapies for relapsed cervical cancer.
And if you look at perhaps the most recent approval at cervical cancer, it was pembro in PD-1 high expressors 
with a 14%, that's 1-4-percent response rate. But they were durable responses. And if you look at chemotherapy 
that has been used in a lot of publications, there are – I would say the range is probably somewhere between 8% 
and maybe 16%, 17% response rate, sometimes we have durations that are tiny, measured in two months' 
duration. Whereas with a checkpoint, you can get a year or so of duration, which is likely why it got approval even 
with the de minimis response rate because it had duration.

So I think those maybe can help you give you some landmarks of what's out there and clearly we want to do well 
by patients and have a best response we can have, with single agent, look at this in future in combination.
Roger, do you have any color you want to add beyond that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
No, Clay. I agree with your comments. But the bar is set by historical precedent and we need to wait for the TV 
results to see how they match up.

Operator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Kennen Mackay with RBC Capital Markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kennen Mackay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter, and the narrowed and slightly raised 
guidance. Maybe a quick commercial question first, I'd hope for a little bit more color on the growth of ADCETRIS 
in frontline PTCLs and the higher growth in CTCLs, where it looks like two factors are at play. All of those patients 
are CD30 positive. And I think the NCCN guidelines there are may be a little bit more generous versus other 
PTCLs. I was wondering of those two drivers which had been the bigger impediment to use outside of CTCL, sort 
of lack of broad CD30 testing there or just lack of supportive data? And really what can be done about that to 
increase utility outside of CTCLs? And then I have one quick follow-up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Okay. So, there has been a lot of work done on looking at CD30 expression in both CTCL and of in PTCL. And if 
you asked scientifically, are there patients with PTCL and CTCL that are absolutely negative for CD30? I could 
not with a clear conscience say that there are patients that are truly negative. What I can tell you is there are 
some patients that have low scores on histology when looking at a single nodule.
But if you look at other nodules, they could be high. Keep in mind, CD30 is an activation antigen. And if you take 
some tissues that are low or in background with histology, and you do other types of techniques to look at 
expression, you can see CD30 expression there. So, to me, it's not totally a – is our CTCL and PTCL CD30 
positive or negative. It's more of a what the rate – what the expression level is and are some really in the 
background of histology which is kind of a blunt tool, although readily used across different cancer centers. So, it's 
an easy tool to use.

So, having said that, you're asking about what could we do about that, how can we grow? And there's been trials 
done and evaluated, for instance in CTCL that was presented not that long ago showing that you have CD30 
positive and then CD30 I will call histology negative. And then the doctors treated both populations and had really 
good responses in both. It was a little bit higher in the CD30 positive than the CD30 histology negative, but they 
certainly weren't CD30 negative. And so I think that there are a lot of things that we could do as we get out there, 
as this product is in the field longer and study this.
And, Roger, you know a lot about the expression of this, and is that something that you want to comment on 
and...?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Yeah. No, I think – and Clay has made the point that there is a dynamic nature to this expression and there 
is a sampling variability, and we have data not just in CTCL, but in other diseases as well where CD30 
expression, one would expect it to mark for responses where we have apparent CD30 negativity where we see 
response.
From a testing perspective, obviously pathologists are an important part of this, and getting the pathologist to 
understand the importance now of CD30 testing in PTCL, because there is a therapeutic that can make a 
difference, is something that we are obviously focused on and interested in trying to improve adoption of scoring 
and the appropriate reporting of pathology.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kennen Mackay
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q
Great. Thank you very much. And then I had one quick pipeline follow-up. I'm up here in Boston at the AACRNCI-EORTC Triple Conference. And some of your data on the next-generation PEG-glucuronide linkers and 
tubulysin payloads was presented up here, maybe enabling higher payload delivery per ADC. Can you maybe 
help us understand the utility of these technologies? And I think this is getting used on one of your nextgeneration ADCs SGN228A which is in Phase 1. If I am right on that, could you maybe help us understand when 
we might see some of that initial data and what to look for in that data? Thank you very much and congrats again.

Thanks, Kennen. So, thank you for the introduction to talk about stuff that's part of our growing technology and 
our leadership in ADCs. So, we are really excited about our newest ADC in clinical trials that we call SGN228A. It 
targets CD228 or what's been referred to as p97. And this is expressed on a variety of solid tumors. And we have 
also not only just used this target, but we have used a new confirmation in ADC that utilizes PEG groups, utilizes 
an [ph] ink (00:31:22) load.
You may be aware that with ADCETRIS and with LV, we utilize approximately four drugs per antibody molecule. 
And with our newest technology with CD228, we're using eight drugs per antibody molecule, but it has a 
completely different linker and a completely different stabilization agent, and we've been working on this and it's in 
clinic now and it's an exciting prospect for us.
One of the commitments that we've made is after we became the industry leader in ADC is to stay there, and 
that's to continue investing in our technology and continue to make drugs that are more potent but also safer and 
try to work on our linkage systems to make them more specific for the tumor. And so this is one example where

we are very hopeful with our technology and we are investing in new ADCs. But as you'll see going forward, we 
have a couple of new technologies to build on what we already have as in leadership position. And I think that the 
future will be a good one for ADCs, not only at Seattle Genetics, but in other companies as other companies are 
making advances and really helping patients.

Thanks. Could you just comment on the next steps for tucatinib in colorectal cancer, and perhaps plans to look at 
other indications such as gastric where the frequency of HER2 overexpression is much higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thank you very much for the question. Roger, can you talk a little bit...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
...about maybe our data and what we're doing next, and then also touch on other diseases?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Right. So thanks for the question. And obviously the HER2CLIMB results, which are really in our view remarkable, 
does point to the potential best-in-class nature of tucatinib. And so we are interested in essentially creating a 
program around tucatinib which will include expanding into other areas of breast cancer, and Clay has already 
mentioned the T-DM1 trial which is in the earlier stage of metastatic disease, we have a neoadjuvant effort 
through I-SPY 2 and we are looking at other areas as well.
With regard to HER2 expressing tumors that are outside of breast cancer, we did have very exciting data, a small 
dataset, but very exciting at ESMO with a combination of trastuzumab and tucatinib with a response rate that's 
north of 50% and looked pretty durable. So we're excited about taking that on, so much so that that was an 
investigator initiated trial which we've taken over. We now essentially own the IND and the trial is now Seattle 
Genetics' corporate sponsor trial. And we plan to continue to evaluate third line colorectal cancer HER2 positive in 
a broader patient population utilizing the MOUNTAINEER trial. And that obviously, if that data is reproducible, 
which we think it will be, that's an area of potential – seeking potential registration outcomes.
And in earlier lines of colorectal cancer, even though the frequency is in the sort of 2% to 5% range, nevertheless, 
it's an important unmet need and it's a large addressable population. So we're working on thinking about what we 
could do earlier.

With regard to gastric, exactly as you say, this is another opportunity. And we already have thought through 
internally what a development plan could look like. We are not ready to share that information at this point, but we 
are definitely interested in gastric and potentially other HER2 expressing tumors as well.

And a follow-up if I may. At this point, how much is HL a driver of ADCETRIS revenue growth versus PTCL?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
I'll turn it over to Robin in a moment. But the general answer is we really don't split them up, and both of them are 
very important to us.
Robin, do you want to give a little color?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin G. Taylor
Chief Commercial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. HL is certainly one of the key revenue growth areas for ADCETRIS, and I think there is certainly room to 
grow with Hodgkin lymphoma. We've seen good uptake both for PTCL and Hodgkin lymphoma, but Hodgkin 
lymphoma is really facing a much more entrenched usage of chemotherapy.
The three-year PFS data that we presented has really helped us get traction in terms of physicians understanding 
the benefit of ADCETRIS, and we will have four-year follow-up data at ASH. And I think as the data matures with 
ECHELON-1, what one can see is that there is a – we've seen that continued benefits from the three-year PFS 
data. The more we can show that there is an enduring benefit, I think the more that we are going to be able to 
convert physicians to understanding the benefit of ADCETRIS.
In terms of the relative contribution, as Clay said, we don't split those up, but I believe that Hodgkin lymphoma is 
continuing to be an important driver for us. We've seen obviously rapid uptake with PTCL as well, and I think 
that's been very encouraging.

Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my questions. And the first one also regarding the commercial question. So, wondering 
how's the first-line PTCL and Hodgkin lymphoma the growth trajectory or growth rate in this quarter compared to 
the last quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, we don't report the specific growth of the disease types. As a whole, we've had a lot of growth year-over-year 
and quarter-over-quarter we grew a little – about 5%. And so that is – it's a strong growth rate. It's within what we 
have for guidance and we're excited about that. And we expect that ADCETRIS over time year-to-year will 
continue to grow as a brand as we make more progress there. But the specifics of PTCL for instance as you 
asked is not something we present.

What I will say is that with PTCL we had OS from our first dataset. So, it is a less challenging discussion with 
doctors when you go out with OS data, where with Hodgkin lymphoma it was contemplated to be – to take a 
number of years to get there, because you need a certain amount of events to give statistical value, so we are not 
there and it is important for us to follow the protocol as it's said and as it's written and try to get to those events.
But in the meantime, the gold standard is five years and docs look at that with Hodgkin lymphoma. Our initial data 
which we published showed two-year worth of data and some doctors – and it was great data, some doctors 
converted and some didn't. And then last year we put out our three years data and we had a nice bump in our 
revenues, and more docs took it on and the data got actually better. It wasn't just continuation of two to three 
years, it looked better.
And now this year we're going to show at ASH coming up in a couple of months, we're going to show four-year 
data. And then next year presumably at ASH, but it's way too early to speculate we'll show the five-year gold 
standard data, and I think that that will go a long way to addressing any questions without even having a OS data. 
So, we're really excited to continue to age the data and go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gena Wang
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q
Great. And then just quick follow-up, quick question regarding the EV-103. So you did mention that you plan to 
start randomized the Phase 3 trial in first-line. Just wondering any additional color you can provide and giving 
Roche IMvigor130 data reported at ESMO? And will you be thinking about triplet versus doublet or it will be in the 
EV-103 plus pembro versus pembro alone?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So, we have yet spelled out the exact trial. And that's something as soon as we start the trial we will spell it out. 
That's been our history that it's not appropriate to state the exact trial till it starts. So stay tuned, we will be doing 
that. But Roger, perhaps you can give some color on your thoughts on IMvigor130, and the kind of approaches 
we could take to go toward approval and the importance of it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Thanks, Clay. So as you can see the EV-103 trial offers you a roadmap as to how we're thinking about what 
possible combinations we can use. And as Clay said, we haven't disclosed those. But you can get a sense of the 
data generation that we will need to support the Phase 3 front-line trial.
With regard to IMvigor130, it's a positive trial, the OS didn't quite make it, obviously from an efficacy perspective 
although it's hard to cross-compare, but we are encouraged by our EV pembro data, which has a response rate of 
70% which is an unusual outcome in this disease. And again, cross-trial comparisons have limits for sure, but the 
response rates that were shown with atezolizumab together with chemotherapy would suggest that at this point 
anyway what our plans to proceed into a frontline trial would suggest that we have a good shot at potentially 
improving the outcomes further.

Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess this one is primarily for Roger. One of the buzzes that 
came out of EV presentation in Barcelona was potential synergies between vedotin and checkpoint. And I think 
it's one of the things a lot of investors are also thinking about in regards to how to value the platform. Do you guys 
have any additional color for us regarding what could be driving potential synergies? And is there anything about 
the vedotin payload or the linker that differentiates it in regard to other ADC approaches?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Roger?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. So the holy grail of drug development is to be able to put two drugs 
together and have a better outcome than in the individual drugs alone. And certainly that response rate is high, 
proof of synergy is a very different thing which requires a high level of scientific rigor. And what I can say is that 
from a mechanistic perspective, if you think about what an ADC is, it's essentially a targeted therapy. So it's 
delivering a payload to a group of tumor cells, inducing in those tumor cells things like immunogenic cell death, 
replicative stress such that the tumor microenvironment may become favorable for an inflammatory response, and 
may, in fact, be amenable then to an immune response that would be assisted by taking the brakes off at immune 
response by giving a PD-1 or a PD-1 inhibitor.
And in the sense of – excuse me, chemotherapy may be much more permissive in terms of what other cells could 
potentially damage, one could speculate that that limited delivery of a cytotoxic payload, just the tumor cells may 
keep the microenvironment more intact. That's one possibility.
With regard to the actual data in terms of what does – could 71% represent synergy, what is interesting is, if you 
look at the data you can see that there's a response regardless of PD-L1 expression, which is encouraging. We 
don't have EV monotherapy data at this point to sort of make the comparison, so it's very hard for a peer numbers 
perspective to say this is what you could expect with pembro and this is what you could expect from EV. But 
regardless of whether it's synergy or not, the clinical data are pretty compelling, and it's certainly compelling us to 
move forward in the development program.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Berens
Analyst, SVB Leerink LLC Q
Okay. Is there anything about vedotin specifically or your linker technology that could make it hard for another 
ADC to have similar effects?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Andy, you're asking a really good question, and there's a lot of work going on in our research effort that I do not –
or research group I should say that do not – are not ready for full discussion. And what we're doing in general is, 
we're evaluating all the different types of payloads and their impact on immunogenic cell death, and I could tell 
you that they're not all the same. And vedotin work really well there, and I don't want to say more than that at this 
point. And at some point in the future we'll put out our research data at an appropriate conference like an AACR

type conference. But we're really excited with our choice of vedotin and how they work well with immuno-oncology 
agents like PD-1s.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andy Hsieh with William Blair.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. So it's encouraging to see that Seattle 
is really hoping to expand the frontline treatment paradigm for Hodgkin lymphoma and also MTCL. So just 
curious, these Phase 3 trials usually take anywhere from three to five years to run, anything you guys learned 
from the ECHELON programs in terms of potential surrogate endpoint to kind of shorten these trials?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
That's a good question. I think especially in the Hodgkin lymphoma space, there's the Stage 1 and 2 that we do 
not yet have approval in, for example. And despite that there's a lot of good data that's been presented, but albeit 
there are relatively small trials and they're not approval trials, but the data is strong. And I think that when you look 
at work that's going on, whether it's in Europe with consortiums or cooperative groups in the US or corporate 
studies, I think that there's a building momentum for using ADCETRIS in a lot of lines of Hodgkin lymphoma. But 
we have to continue really powering through trials and try to look at some novel endpoints that they don't take 
very long. And I think that, that is something that is up for discussion with regulators. I can't give you any details 
on that. Roger, is there anything else you want to say based on what we can?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah, I think Clay is right. There are – it's not just corporate trials that drive these – what can be fairly long-term 
frontline trials. There are co-operative groups and so on which are important entities in the frontline trial execution. 
We are interested what we talked about today was a signal finding study to see if we could in a single arm trial 
show what an ADCETRIS nivo, adriamycin, dacarbazine combination could look like in frontline advanced 
Hodgkin lymphoma. And we think if that data is compelling enough, that could then be the genesis for yet more 
work either by ourselves or by others to see – because the ultimate goal is to cure as many people as we can. 
And that's I think what our focus is on in terms of developing new treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma new 
combination.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andy T. Hsieh
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q
And a follow-up if I can. So in terms of DLBCL, Clay, I think in 2015 ASCO, when the company decided to forego 
the frontline opportunity, I'm just wondering what changed there. I think you mentioned about just the markets 
were pretty crowded, and given kind of failures in the frontline setting one with Revlimid, one with Imbruvica, were 
those kind of the genesis behind the rationale to look at potentially frontline DLBCL again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
So first of all we are in NCCN with DLBCL. And so we hear back from doctors who utilize it, and that's an 
important thing to try to understand what's going on in the world and we have figured that out over the last couple 
of years and have been able to talk to docs and been able to understand the benefit that ADCETRIS has in

DLBCL. The landscape has changed and not necessarily we had big victories as you say. And there are other 
specifics that we have in mind, but we have not announced a specific trial yet, but it's coming and we're excited 
with it and it's something that we need to obviously work through regulators. And with the team here at Seattle 
Genetics and we're trying to go forward and see if we can get another label in DLBCL. So stay tuned on that.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Shanshan Xu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, a few quick ones from me. So this year at ASH, I believe you will have the 
full-year update for ECHELON-1 on the PFS front. Can you please update with us when should we expect the OS 
update for each ECHELON-1?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah, like I said earlier in the call, OS has a preset target number for events, and at that point is when we open 
up the trial. And we have not hit that. It has always been contemplated to be quite a number of years. So we're 
just not there, and it would be inappropriate for me to try to tell you when I think it's going to be, since it's a hard 
prediction.
In the meantime, we are getting PFS data, and our PFS data is aging from two years to three years to four years 
presentation and a couple of months at ASH and we're excited to do that. And then next year hitting that gold 
standard of five years of PFS. And as we get closer to the five-year PFS data time point, doctors ask about the 
OS less, because if you're at five-year PFS and your lines are pretty flat in the Kaplan-Meier plots, that signifies 
really what the doctors need to know. So while we are going and planning on getting OS, I think that five-year 
PFS is going to be very significant as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Shanshan Xu
Analyst, Berenberg Capital Markets LLC Q
[ph] No problem (00:51:43). My next one is that given the strength of data from HER2CLIMB and the fact that you 
already initiated HER2CLIMB-02 for tucatinib plus T-DM1, we actually look forward to including this market 
opportunity in our model. So how should we think about the size of the indicated patient population for tucatinib 
and T-DM1 combination, considering the dynamic in the treatment arena for HER2-positive breast cancer 
patients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Right. Well, we haven't really come out yet at this point and talked about the size of the population. I mean, it's a 
little premature for us – we just came out with our data – to start talking about what we think size of population is 
and – which leads right into a marketplace discussion, which leads into a pricing discussion. We have done a lot 
of work on this. We have been doing a lot of work. We're intending for HER2CLIMB to be not just a US product, 
but a global product. I mean, we have a randomized study and a great dataset. We're really looking forward to

presenting that dataset at San Antonio. And so, I think that the market opportunity is substantive, and you'll be

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Silvan Tuerkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Thank you for taking my question and congrats on all the progress this quarter. It's very promising that you think 
about moving into a muscle invasive bladder cancer with EV. What types of data have you seen before to inform 
the utility of EV in this setting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Thanks for the question. I will turn it over to Roger to give you his thoughts on muscle invasive bladder cancer 
which is a really big opportunity and an unmet medical need opportunity. But we have not – we have recently 
opened a cohort of patients, so we're just now treating our first patients in muscle invasive. So if you're asking 
what is our clinical data, we're assembling our first clinical data. If you're asking about preclinical, about why we 
are looking at this, we have looked at expression of Nectin-4 in the premetastatic stage and certainly it's 
expressed strongly there as well. And there's been a bunch of preclinical work that have been done to show that 
we think that this could be very effective and not only muscle invasive, but even earlier stage than that, nonmuscle invasive. So, in all stages of bladder cancer, which is a very substantial size market with about 80,000 
incidents in just the US each year for those three types of cancers, the metastatic, the muscle invasive and the 
non-muscle invasive.
So a lot of preclinical work, a substantial amount of clinical work in metastatic both for single-agent and 
combination, and now we're treating patients in muscle invasive. Roger, is there any other details?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger D. Dansey
Chief Medical Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah. I think, so EV is obviously active in metastatic disease. And so one could – it's not a difficult step to take to 
expect that it may have meaningful activity in Nectin-4 expressing non-metastatic disease, and so I think that's 
where we are. We obviously, as Clay said, we need to generate the data so we can see exactly what the effect of 
EV monotherapy is and also look at the combination.
And as you know, the landscape for muscle invasive bladder cancer, because there is meaningful unmet need, is 
busy right now. There are lots of trials that are running, and so understanding what a regulatory path forward 
could look like, we already have evidence or we have [ph] worked (00:55:43) examples ahead of us. And so, if we 
are able to take EV into a randomized trial, essentially the population splits into cis-ineligible and cis-eligible, and 
the reason why it's cis-eligible versus ineligible, because cisplatin is the only drug that's shown – or cisplatin 
combination is the only combination that's shown to actually have benefit in the muscle invasive space. And so, 
you can see clinical trial designs compartmentalize those two populations, and we would be interested obviously 
in both.
We have generated data with EV-pembro in the cis-ineligible metastatic population, so we do have that first piece 
of information. And just stay tuned, we're working on moving EV forward into these earlier lines of bladder cancer.

Silvan Tuerkcan
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q
Great. Thank you so much. And a quick follow-up if I may. I'm also encouraged that you're already expanding 
tucatinib. What made you initiate tucatinib plus Kadcyla and was there anything promising that you've already 
seen in the HER2CLIMB dataset? Or is it just the commercial [ph] regime (00:57:02)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Please keep in mind that there was a study that had been done, an early study that was single arm, not 
randomized, but it combined tucatinib and Kadcyla. And the data had been presented at a conference and they 
were very strong. So we do have the early data.
And to us, together with the early data and the outstanding HER2CLIMB data that you'll see in San Antonio, it 
makes sense to go earlier in line and invest in it. And this time, it's a randomized study. And so we don't need to 
do another single-arm study that's been done, and the safety and efficacy or the risk/benefit that some docs call it, 
looked pretty darn good. But it was a single-arm study. So we are investing in a randomized study that is up and 
running.

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q
Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe, Todd, a couple on the financials. So as you guys 
diversify out away from ADCETRIS and a lot of the key studies for ADCETRIS have read out, you are putting 
more money now into the rest of the pipeline, whether it be EV or tucatinib or TV. Can you give us a sense about 
the weighting of expenses for modeling purposes for EV versus the rest of the program on a go-forward basis? 
Should we assume that EV is the bulk of expenses just based on what you've said, or do you think that it will be 
more equally spread across all of your pipeline products? Thanks.

ADCETRIS has been the predominant driver of our expenses. We've now got six labels. We've run a number of 
very large clinical trials and while we're continuing to do additional work, some of which you heard on the call 
today, it's becoming a probably a lower overall percentage of our investment in R&D.
What is now really starting to come forward are investments in programs like EV, where as you heard today, 
we've got a very expansive development program for that compound, as well as to tucatinib. I think the 
HER2CLIMB data to us turns this into a program, not a clinical trial. You've heard a little bit about our work that's 
already starting in combination with Kadcyla in blinded therapy before the HER2CLIMB setting. And then certainly 
we're looking at things like colorectal cancer where the data that we presented at ESMO were quite encouraging.

So I think maybe to get back to your question, I think you will see a growing share of expense hitting programs 
like enfortumab and tucatinib, and ADCETRIS will continue to be substantial, but probably becoming a smaller 
contributor to the overall pie. And then obviously we look to see what else comes out of the pipeline, we've got TV 
in a pivotal study and a very broad portfolio of earlier stage assets that we just talked a little bit about today.

Operator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Messer with Needham & Co.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chad Messer
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the – on the recent progress. First real quick, is there 
any more you can say about the preclinical assets that Todd referred to in prepared remarks? Maybe even just a 
rough idea of what the spend on that was?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Well, I could tell you not from a financial standpoint that we do a lot of different deals and we bring in technology, 
we bring in preclinical assets. This is – this has happened like almost every year, we do small different deals and 
some of them work out really well, and some of them just in our research front.
And, Todd, you could talk a little about why it was in – why you mentioned it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Todd E. Simpson
Chief Financial Officer, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Yeah, sure. So, not that it was a huge deal, but it was the principle driver of why we increase our R&D guidance 
just a bit, so I won't – I can't give the numbers out, but that was the main contributor. And as Clay mentioned, it's a 
really interesting pre-clinical asset that we think could become a clinical asset relatively soon, so that's what got 
us excited about it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chad Messer
Analyst, Needham & Co. LLC Q
Great. Yeah. That's very helpful. And then just for a follow-up. Maybe couple of questions here, but they're all very 
related if you can indulge me, I wanted to go back to TV. Clay, you mentioned how terrible relapse cervical cancer 
is, and that not everybody gets vaccinated, so it's still a problem. What is your view of the kind of opportunity in 
relapse cervical cancer, but also for TV? I know you're looking at a whole bunch of other cancers that express 
tissue factor. So your thoughts on the opportunity for a tissue factor targeting therapy more broadly. And then 
tissue factor itself, can you just remind me, is that sort of as bearably expressed across tumor types say like a 
CD30 is or is it a little bit more uniformed? Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clay B. Siegall
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Seattle Genetics, Inc. A
Sure. So, first of all on TV, we are expanded past just cervical for sure. We have a trial that's listed on 
ClinicalTrials.gov, that's in ovarian cancer. And we have a basket study we're working on in other types of 
cancers. So stay tuned for us to report in the future when we have enough substantive data at appropriate peer 
reviewed conferences like we always do on the data outside of cervical that we're working on.

So there's a lot of interest in it. And you asked about the expression of TF or tissue factor. And you know, that's 
something that's expressed broadly on solid tumors at very high density. It's not really a heme target, so I wouldn't 
expect us to go do a lot of lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma type work with it. Rather, it's more on the solid tumors 
that you would expect, the big solid tumors.
And the expression on cervical and things like ovarian are very high, so really good targets, and important 
diseases that need additional therapies that have unmet need for a lot of patients. So we're really excited about 
our partnership with Genmab working on TV, and we continue to look forward to presenting more and more data.

0,"adjusted ebitda came in at $115 million, decreasing 59.8% from the year-ago figure of $286 million.","
INCLAIM - The adjusted ebitda figure of $115 million represents the difference between the company's operating income ($2.7B) and its net loss ($1.2B), adjusted for certain items and non-recurring charges. The 2020 decrease of $286 million is due to the decrease in sports rights revenue and the timing of when content production was ramped up. The label 'INCLAIM' is appropriate as it is a claim of the company regarding its adjusted ebitda figure, which is directly related to its current financial status and not just factual past or present information."

Example 1 (INCLAIM): The Company's investments in 'this year initiative' are likely in the range of $1,000,000,000. This is likely due to a mix of capital expenditures, operational improvements, and investments in new business lines. The company's total investment over the 2014–2017 time period is likely close to $4,200,000,000.
Example 2 (OUTOFCOLOM): The Company's investments in 'this initiative' are likely in the range of $1.000,000,000.

In this case, it is because there is no factual past or present information, rather, it is just a numerical figure."

To classify the sentences, we use the following labels:
- INCLAIM: The sentence is about a claim that is not factual or not proven.
- OUTOFCLAIM: The sentence is not a claim, but factual past or present information.
Here are some examples:

- Example 1: ""I think I can, I think I can."" This sentence is a claim that you are capable of doing something.
- Example 2: ""I think, therefore I am."" This sentence is not a claim, but factual past or present information.
- Example 3: ""We are not responsible for their actions."" This sentence is factual past or present information.
- Example 4: ""I love my dog."" This sentence is not a claim, but factual past or present information.
- Example 5: ""I have a small dog."" This sentence is factual past or present information.

For the sentence in each case, we classify it as either INCLAIM or OUTOFCLAIM:

Example 1: ""We are not responsible for their actions."": INCLAIM

Example 2: ""I think, therefore I am."": INCLAIM

Example 3: ""I love my dog."": OUTOFCLAIM

Example 4: ""We are not responsible for their actions."": INCLAIM

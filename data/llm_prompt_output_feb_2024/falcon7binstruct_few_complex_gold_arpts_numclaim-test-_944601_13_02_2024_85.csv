INCOLAIM (Incorporation into net income; 'Financial forecast') - As an AI language model, I have been trained on natural language processing techniques and can understand complex sentences. Here, I can explain the difference between INCLAIM and OUTOFCLAIM as financial terms that I've learned from my training data.

INCOLAIM, as the label indicates, refers to the act of providing a monetary value in the form of dividends. Companies may choose to pay dividends in order to distribute a portion of the company's earnings to its shareholders. This is a form of financial forecast as it is a projection of future payments of dividends, rather than an actual payment made. The dividend policy may be subject to shareholder approval and board decisions, and it is usually tied to the company's financial health, growth prospects, and market dynamics.

INCOAIM differs from OUTOFCLAIM, as it is a financial forecast while OUTOFCLAIM refers to factual or numerical data that can be used for decision-making in business or financial planning. INCOAIM may be used to estimate future dividend payments while OUTOFCLAIM refers to established financials used for comparisons, forecasts, budgeting, or planning.

Regarding the sentence provided, ""we paid $150.7 million in dividends and deployed $64.9 million to buy back 1.1 million shares."" The sentence is INCOLAIM, as it is a financial forecast regarding the company's share repurchase program and not an actual payment made."
